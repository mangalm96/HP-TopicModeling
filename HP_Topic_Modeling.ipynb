            ": The Unbreakable Vow Snow was swirling against the icy windows once more; Christmas was approaching fast. Hagrid had already singlehandedly delivered the usual twelve C hristmas trees to the Great Hall; garlands of holly and tinsel had been twisted around the banisters of the stairs; everlasting candles glowed from inside the helmets of suits of armor and great bunches of mistletoe had been hung at intervals along the corridors. Large groups of girls tended to converge underneath the mistletoe bunches every time Harry went past, which caused blockages in the corridors; fortunat e ly, however, Harry's frequent nighttime wanderings had given him an unusually good knowledge of the castle's secret passageways, so that he was often, without too much difficulty, to naviga t e mistletoe-free routes between classes. Ron, who might once have found the necessity of these detours excuse for jealousy rather than hilarity, simply roared with laughter about it all. Although Harry much preferred this new laughing, joking Ron to the moody, aggressive model he had been enduring for the last few weeks, the improved Ron came at a heavy price. Firstly, Harry had to put up with the frequent presence of Lavender Brown, who seemed to regard any moment that she was not kissing Ron as a moment wasted; and secondly, Harry found himself once more the best friend of two people who seemed unlikely ever to speak to each other again. Ron, whose hands and forearms still bore scratches and cuts from Hermione's bird attack, was taking a defensive and resentful tone. \"She can't complain,\" he told Harry. \"She snogged Krum. So she's found out someone wants to snog me too. Well, it's a free country. I haven't done anything wrong.\" Harry did not answer, but pretended to be absorbed in the book they were supposed to have read before Charms next morning (Quintessence: A Q uest). Determined as he was to remain friends with both Ron and Hermione, he was spending a lot of time with his mouth shut tight. \"I never promised Hermione anything , \" Ron mumbled. \"I mean, all right, I was going to go to Slughorn's Christmas party with her, but she never said... just as friends... I'm a free agent...\" Harry turned a page of Quintessence, aware that Ron was watching him. Ron's voice trailed away in mutters, barely audible over the loud crackling of the fire, though Harry thought he caught the words \"Krum\" and \"Can't complain\" again. Hermione's schedule was so full that Harry could only talk to her properly in the evenings, when Ron was, in any case, so tightly wrapped around Lavender that he did not notice what Harry was doing. Hermione refused to sit in the common room while Ron was there, So Harry generally joined her in the library, which meant that their conversations were held in whispers. \"He's at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes,\" said Hermione, while the librarian , Madam Pince, prowled the shelves behind them. \"I really couldn't care less.\" She raised her quill and dotted an 'i' so ferociously that she punctured a hole in her parchment. Harry said nothing. He thought his voice might soon vanish from the lack of use. He bent a little lower over Advanced Potion-Making and continued to make notes on Everlasting Elixirs, occasionally pausing to decipher the p rince's useful additions to Libatius B orage's text. \"And incidentally,\" said Hermione, after a few moments, \"you need to be careful.\" \"For the last time,\" said Harry, speaking in a slightly hoarse tone after three-quarters of an ho u r of silence, \"I am not giving back this book . I've learned more from the Half-blood p rince than Snape or Slughorn have taught me in--\" \"I'm not talking about your stupid so-called prince,\" said Hermione , giving his book a nasty look as though it had been rude to her. \"I'm talki ng about earlier. I went into the girl's bathroom just before I came in here and there were about a dozen girls in there, including that Romilda Vane , trying to decide how to slip you a love potion. They're all hoping they're going to get you to take them to Slughorn's party, and thay all seem to have bought Fred and George's love potions, which I'm afraid to say probably work --\" \"Why didn't you confiscate them then?\" demanded Harry, it seemed extraordinary that Hermione's m ania for upholding the rules could have abandoned her at this crucial juncture. \"They didn't have the potions with them in the bathroom,\" said Hermione scornfully, \"They were just discussing tactics. As I doubt the Half-blood prince\" she gave the book another scornful look \"could dream up an antidote for a dozen different love potions at once, I'd just invite someone to go with you, that'll stop all the others thinking they've still got a chance. It's tomor r ow night, they're getting desperate.\" \"There isn't anyone I want to invite,\" mumbled Harry, who was still not trying to think about Ginny any more than he could help, despite the fact the fact that she kept cropping up in his dreams in ways that made him devoutly thankful that Ron could not perform Legilimency. \"Well, just be careful what you drink, because Romilda Va ne looked like she meant business.\" said Hermione grimly. She hitched up the long roll of parchment on which she was writing her Arithma n cy essay and continued to scratch away with her quill. Harry wa t che d her with his mind a long way away. \"Hang on a moment,\" he said slowly. \"I thought Filch had banned anything bought at Weasley's Wizard Wheezes?\" \"And when has anyone ever paid attention to what Filch has banned?\" asked Hermione, still concentrating on her essay. \"But I thought all the owls were being searched. So how come these grils are able to bring love potions into the school?\" \"Fred and George send them disguised as perfumes and cough potions,\" said Hermione. \"It's part of their Owl order service.\" \"You know a lot about it.\" Hermione gave him the kind of nasty look she had just given his copy of Advanced Potion-Making. \"It was all on the back of the bottles they showed Ginny and me in the summer,\" she said coldly, \"I don't go around putting potions in people's drinks... or pretending too eit h er, which is just as bad...\" \"Yeah, well, never mind that,\" said Harry quickly. \"The point is, Filch is being fooled isn't he? These girls are getting stuff into the school disguised as something else! So why couldn't Malfoy have brought the necklace into the school --?\" \"Oh, Harry... not that again...\" \"Come on, why not?\" demanded Harry. \"Look , \" sighed Hermione, \"Secrecy Sensors detect jinxes, curses, and concealment charms, don't they? They're used to find d ark magic and d ark obje c ts. They'd have picked up a powerful curse , like the one in the necklace, withi n seconds. But something that's just been put in the wrong bottle wouldn ' t register -- anyway Love potions aren't d ark or dangerous -\" \"Easy for you to say,\" muttered Harry, thinking of Romilda Vane. \"-- so it would be down to Filch to realise it wasn't a cough potion, and he's not a very good wizard, I doubt he can tell one potion from --\" Hermione stopped dead; Harry had heard it too. Somebody had moved close behind them among the dark bookshelves. They waited, and a moment later the vulturelike countenance of Madam Pince appeared around the corner, her sunken cheeks, her skin like parchment, and her long hooked nose illuminated unflatteringly by the lamp she was carrying. \"The library is now closed,\" she said, \"Mind you return anything you have borrowed to the correct -- what have you been doing to that book, you depraved boy?\" \"It isn't the library's, it's mine!\" said Harry hastily, snatching his copy of Advanced Potion-Making off the table as she lunged at it with a clawlike hand. \" Spoiled!\" she hissed . \"Desecrated, befouled !\" \"It's just a book that's been written on!\" said Harry, tugging it out of her grip. She looked as though she might have a seizure; Hermione, who had hastily packed her things, grabbed Harry by the arm and frogmarched him away. \"She'll ban you from the library if you're not careful. Why did you have to bring that stupid book?\" \"It's not my fault she's barking mad, Hermione. Or d'you think she overheard you being rude about Filch? I've always thought there might be something between them...\" \"Oh, ha ha..\" Enjoying the fact that they could speak normally again, they made their way along the deserted lamp-lit corridors back to the common room, arguing w hether or not Filch and Madam Pince were secretly in love with each other. \"Baubles\" said Harry to the Fat Lady, this being the new, festive password. \"Same to you,\" said the fat lady with a roguish grin, and she swung forward to admit them. \"Hi, Harry!\" said Romilda Vane, the moment he had climbed through the portrait hole. \"Fancy a gillywater?\" Hermione gave him a \"what-did-I-tell-you?\" look over her shoulder. \"No thanks,\" said Harry quickly. \"I don't like it much.\" \"Well, take these anyway,\" said Romilda, thrusting a box into his hands. \"Chocolate Cauldrons, they've got firewhiskey in them. My gran sent them to me, but I don't like them.\" \"Oh-- right -- thanks a lot.\" said Harry, who could not think what else to say. \" Er-- I ' m just going over here with ...\" He hurried off behind Hermione, his voice tailing away feebly. \"Told you,\" said Hermione succinctly, \" Sooner you ask someone, sooner they'll all leave you alone and you can --\" But her face suddnly turned blank; she had just spotted Ron and Lavender, who were i ntertwined in the same armchair. \"Well, good night, Harry\" said Hermione, though it was only seven o'clock in the evening, and she left for the girl s' dormitory without another word. Harry went to bed comforting himself that there was only one more day of lessons to struggle through, plus Slughorn's party, after which he and Ron would depart together for the B urrow. It now seemed impossible that Ron and Hermione would make up with each other before the holidays began, but perhaps, somehow, the break would give them time to calm down, think better of their behavior... But his hopes were not high, and they sank still lower after enduring a Transfiguration lesson with them both next day. They had just embarked upon the immensely difficult topic of human transfiguration; working in front of mirrors , they were suposed to be changing the color of their own eyebrows. Hermione laughed unkindly at Ron's disastrous first attempt, during which he somehow managed to give himself a spectacular handlebar mustache; Ron retaliated by doing a cruel but accurate impression of Hermione jumping up and down in her seat every time Profe s sor McGonagall asked a question, which Lavender and Parvati found deeply amusing and which reduced Hermione to the verge of tears again. She raced out of the classroom on the bell, leaving half her things behind; Harry, deciding that her need was greater than Ron's just now, scooped up her remaining po ssessions and followed her. He finally tracked her down as she emerged from a girl's bathroom on the floor below. She was accompanied by Luna Lovegood, who was patting her vaguely on the back. \"Oh, hello, Harry , \" said Luna . \" D id you know one of your eyebrows is bright yellow?\" \"Hi, Luna. Hermione , you left your stuff...\" He held out her books. \"Oh, yes,\" said Hermione in a choked voice, taking her things and turning away quickly to hide the fact she was wiping her eyes with her pencil case. \"Thank you , Harry. Well, I'd better get going...\" And she hurried off, without ever giving Harry any time to offer words of comfort, though admittedly he could not think of any. \"She's a bit upset , \" said Luna. \"I thought at first it was Moaning Myrtle in there, but it turned out to be Hermione. She said something about Ron Weasley...\" \"Yeah, they've had a row,\" said Harry. \"He says funny things sometimes, doesn't he?\" said Luna as they set off down the corridor together. \"But he can be a bit unkind. I noticed that last year.\" \" I s'pose , \" said Harry. Luna was demonstrating her usual knack of speaking uncomfortable truths; he had never met anyone quite like her. \"So have you had a good term?\" \"Oh, it's been al l right,\" said Luna. \" A bit lonely without the D.A. Ginny's been nice, though. She stopped two boys in our Transfiguration class calling me 'Loony' the other day --\" \"How would you like to come to S lughorn's party with me tonight?\" The words were out of Harry's mouth before he could stop them; he heard himself say them as though it were a stranger speaking. Luna turned her protuberant eyes to him in surprise. \"Slughorn's party? With you?\" \"Yeah,\" said Harry, \"We're supposed to bring guests, so I thought you might like.. I mean...\" He was keen to make his intentions perfectly clear. \" I mean, just as friends, you know. But if you don't want to...\" He was already half hoping that she didn't want to. \"O h no, I'd love to go with you as friends!\" said Luna, beaming as he had never seen her beam before. \"Nobody's ever asked me to a party before, as a friend! Is that why you dyed your eyebrow, for the party? Should I dye mine too?\" \"No\" said Harry firmly, \"That was a mistake. I'll get Hermione to put it right for me. So I'll meet you in the entrance hall at eight o'clock then . \" \"AHA!\" screamed a voice from overhead and both of them jumped; unnoticed by either of them, they had just passed underneath Peeves, who was hanging upside down from a chandelier and grinning maliciously at them. \"Potty asked Loony to go to the part y ! Potty lurves Loony! Potty luuuuuurves Looooony!\" And he zoomed away cackling and shrieking, \"Potty loves Loony!\" \"Nice to keep these things private,\" said Harry. And sure enough, in no time at all the whole school seemed to know that Harry Potter was taking Luna Lovegood to Slughorn's party. \"You could've taken anyone!\" said Ron in disbelief over dinner. \"Anyone! And you chose Loony Lovegood?\" \"Don't call her that, Ron!\" snapped Ginny, pausing behind Harry on her way to join friends. \"I'm really glad you're taking her Harry, she's so excited.\" And she moved on down the table to sit with Dean. Harry tried to feel pleased that Ginny was glad he was taking Luna to the party but could not quite manage it. A long way along the table Hermione was sitting alone, playing with her stew. Harry noticed Ron looking at her furtively. \"You could say sorry , \" suggested Harry bluntly. \"What , and get attacked by another flock of canaries?\" muttered Ron. \"What did you have to imitate her for?\" \"She laughed at my mustache!\" \"So did I, it was the stupidest thing I've ever seen.\" But Ron did not seem to have he a rd; Lavender had just arrived with Parvati. Squeezing herself in between Harry and Ron, Lavender flung her arms around Ron's neck. \"Hi, Harry,\" said Parvati who, like Harry, looked faintly embarrassed and bored by the behavior of their two friends. \"Hi,\" said Harry, \"How're you? You're staying at Hogwarts, then? I heard your parents wanted you to leave.\" \"I managed to talk them out o f it for the time being,\" said Parvati. \"That Katie thing really freaked them out, but as there hasn't been anything since... Oh, hi, Hermione!\" Parvati positively beamed. Harry could tell that she was feeling guilty for having laughed at Hermione in Transfiguration. He looked around and saw that Hermione was beaming back, if possible even more brightly. Girls were very strange sometimes. \"Hi, Parvati!\" said Hermione, ignoring Ron and Lavender completely. \"Are you going to Slughorn's party tonight?\" \"No invite,\" said Parvati gloomily. \"I'd love to go, though, it sounds like it's going to be really good... You're going, aren't you?\" \"Yes, I'm meeting Cormac at eight, and we're -\" There was a noise like a plunger being withdrawn from a blocked sink , and Ron surfaced. Hermione acted as though she had not seen or heard anything. \"- we're going up to the party together.\" \"Cormac?\" said Parvati. \"Cormac McLaggen, you mean?\" \"That's right,\" said Hermione sweetly. \"The one who *almost*\" - she put a great deal of emphasis on the word - \"bec a me Gryffindor Keeper.\" \"Are you going out with him, then?\" asked Parvati, wide-eyed. \"Oh - yes - didn't you know?\" said Harmione, with a most un-Hermione-ish giggle. \"No!\" said Parvati, looking positively agog at thi s piece of gossip. \"Wow , you like your Quidditch players, don't you? First Krum, then McLaggen.\" \"I like *really good* Quidditch players,\" Hermione corrected her, still smiling. \"Well, see you... Got to go and get ready for the party...\" She left. At once Lavender and Parvati put their heads together to discuss this new development, with everything they had ever heard about McLaggen, and all they had ever guessed about Hermione. Ron looked strangely blank and said nothing. Harry was left to ponder in silence the depths to which girls would sink to get revenge. When he arrived in the entrance hall at eight o'clock that night, he found an unusually large number of girls lurking there, all of whom seemed to be staring at him resentfully as he approached Luna. She was wearing a set of spangled silver robes that were attracting a certain amount of giggles from the onlookers, but otherwise she looked quite nice. Harry was glad, in any case, that she had left off her radish earrings, her butterbeer cork necklace, and her Spectrespecs. \"Hi,\" he said. \"Shall we get going then?\" \"Oh yes,\" she said happily. \"Where is the party?\" \"Slughorn's office,\" said Harry, leading her up the marble staircase away from all the staring and muttering. \"Did you hear, there's supposed to be a vampire coming?\" \"Rufus Scrimgeour?\" asked Luna. \"I - what?\" said Harry, disconcerted. \"You mean the Minister of Magic?\" \"Yes, he's a vampire,\" said Luna matter-of-factly. \"Father wrote a very long article about it when Scrimgeour first took over from Cornelius Fudge, but he was forced not to publish by somebody from the Ministry. Obviously, they didn't want the truth to get out!\" Harry, who thought it most unlikely that Rufus Scrimgeour was a vampire, but who was used to Luna repeating her father's bizarre views as though they were fact, did not reply; they were already approaching Slughorn's office and the sounds of laughter, music, and loud conversation were growing louder with every step they took. Whether it had been built that way, or because he had used magical trickery to make it so, Slughorn's office was much larger than the usual teacher's study. The ceiling and walls had been draped with emerald, crimson , and gold hangings, so that it looked as though they were all inside a vast tent. The room was crowded and stuffy and bathed in the red light cast by an ornate golden lamp dangling from the center of the ceiling in which real fairies were fluttering, each a brilliant speck of light. Loud singing accompanied by what sounded like mandolins issued from a distant corner; a haze of pipe smoke hung over several elderly warlocks deep in conversation, and a number of house-elves were negotiating their way squeakily through the forest of knees, obscured by the heavy silver platters of food they were bearing, so that they looked like little roving tables. \"Harry, m'boy!\" boomed Slughorn, almost as soon as Harry and Luna had squeezed in through the door. \"Come in, come in, so many people I'd like you to meet!\" Slughorn was wearing a tasseled velvet hat to match his smoking jacket. Gripping Harry's arm so tightly he might have been hoping to Disapparate with him, Slughorn led him purposefully into the party; Harry seized Luna's hand and dragged her along with him. \"Harry, I'd like you to meet Eldred Worple, an old student of mine, author of ' Blood Brothers: My L ife Amongst the Vampires' - and, of course, his friend Sanguini.\" Worple, who was a small, stout, bespectacled man, grabbed Harry's hand and shook it enthusiastically; the vampire Sanguini, who was tall and emaciated with dark shadows under his eyes, merely nodded. He looked rather bored. A gaggle of girls was standing close to him, looking curious and excited. \"Harry Potter, I am simply delighted!\" said Worple, peering shortsightedly up into Harry's face. \"I was saying to Professor Slughorn only the other day, 'Where is the biography of Harry Potter for which we have all been waiting?'\" \"Er,\" said Harry, \"were you?\" \"Just as modest as Horace described!\" said Worple. \"But seri-ously\" -- his manner changed; it became suddenly businesslike -- \"I would be delighted to write it myself-- people are craving to know more about you, dear boy, craving! If you were prepared to grant me a few interviews, say in four- or five-hour sessions, why, we could have the book finished within months. And all with very little effort on your part, I assure you -- ask Sanguini here if it isn't quite -- Sanguini, stay here!\" added Worple, suddenly stern, for the vampire had been edging toward the nearby group of girls, a rather hungry look in his eye. \"Here, have a pasty,\" said Worple, seizing one from a passing elf and stuffing it into Sanguini's hand before turning his attention back to Harry. \"My dear boy, the gold you could make, you have no idea --\" \"I'm definitely not interested,\" said Harry firmly, \"and I've just seen a friend of mine, sorry.\" He pulled Luna after him into the crowd; he had indeed just seen a long mane of brown hair disappear between what looked like two members of the Weird Sisters. \"Hermione! Hermione !\" \"Harry! There you are, thank goodness! Hi, Luna !\" \"What's happened to you?\" asked Harry, for Hermione looked distinctly disheveled, rather as though she had just fought her way out of a thicket of Devil's Snare. \"Oh, I've just escaped -- I mean, I've just left Cormac,\" she said. \"Under the mistletoe,\" she added in explanation, as Harry continued to look questioningly at her. \"Serves you right for coming with him,\" he told her severely. \"I thought he'd annoy Ron most,\" said Hermione dispassion-ately. \"I debated for a while about Zacharias Smith, but I thought, on the whole --\" \"You considered Smith?\" said Harry, revoked. \"Yes, I did, and I'm starting to wish I'd chosen him, McLaggen makes Grawp look a gentleman. Let's go this way, we'll be able to see him coming, he's so tall. . . .\" The three of them made their way over to the other side of the room, scooping up goblets of mead on the way, realizing too late that Professor Trelawney was standing there alone. \"Hello,\" said Luna politely to Professor Trelawney. \"Good evening, my dear,\" said Professor Trelawney, focusing upon Luna with some difficulty. Harry could smell cooking sherry again. \"I haven't seen you in my classes lately. ..\" \"No, I've got Firenze this year,\" said Luna. \"Oh, of course,\" said Professor Trelawney with an angry, drunken titter. \"Or Dobbin, as I prefer to think of him. You would have thought, would you not, that now I am returned to the school Professor Dumbledore might have got rid of the horse? But no ... we share classes. . . . It's an insult, frankly, an insult. Do you know. . .\" Professor Trelawney seemed too tipsy to have recognized Harry. Under cover of her furious criticisms of Firenze, Harry drew closer to Hermione and said, \"Let ' s get something straight. Are you planning to tell Ron that you interfered at Keeper tryouts?\" Hermione raised her eyebrows. \"Do you really think I'd stoop that low?\" Harry looked at her shrewdly. \"Hermione, if you can ask 0111 McLaggen --\" \"There's a difference,\" said Hermione with dignity. \"I've got no plans to tell Ron anything about what might, or might not, have happened at Keeper tryouts.\" \"Good,\" said Harry fervently. \"Because he'll just fall apart again, and we'll lose the next match --\" \"Quidditch!\" said Hermione angrily. \"Is that all boys care about? Cormac hasn't asked me one single question about myself, no, I've just been treated to 'A Hundred Great Saves Made by Cormac McLaggen' nonstop ever since -- oh no, here he comes!\" She moved so fast it was as though she had Disapparated; one moment she was there, the next, she had squeezed between two guffawing witches and vanished. \"Seen Hermione?\" asked McLaggen, forcing his way through the throng a minute later. \"No, sorry,\" said Harry, and he turned quickly to join in Luna's conversation, forgetting for a split second to whom she was talking. \"Harry Potter!\" said Professor Trelawney in deep, vibrant tones, noticing him for the first time. \"Oh, hello,\" said Harry unenthusiastically. \"My dear boy!\" she said in a very carrying whisper. \"The rumors! The stories! 'The Chosen One'! Of course, I have known for a very long time. . . . The omens were never good, Harry. . . But why have you not returned to Divination? For you, of all people, the subject is of the utmost importance!\" \"Ah, Sybi l l, we all think our subject's most important!\" said a loud voice, and Slughorn appeared at Professor Trelawney s other side, his face very red, his velvet hat a little askew, a glass of mead in one hand and an enormous mince pie in the other. \"But I don't t hink I've ever known such a natural at Potions!\" said Slughorn, re-garding Harry with a fond, if bloodshot, eye. \"Instinctive, you know -- like his mother! I've only ever taught a few with this kind of ability, I can tell you that, Sybi l l -- why even Severus --\" And to Harry's horror, Slughorn threw out an arm and seemed to scoop Snape out of thin air toward them. \"Stop skulking and come and join us, Severus!\" hiccuped Slughorn happily. \"I was just talking about Harry's exceptional po-tion-making! Some credit must go to you, of course, you taught him for five years!\" Trapped, with Slughorns arm around his shoulders, Snape looked down his hooked nose at Harry, his black eyes narrowed. \"Funny, I never had the impression that I managed to teach Potter anything at all.\" \"Well, then, it's natural ability!\" shouted Slughorn. \"You should have seen what he gave me, first lesson, Draught of Living Death -- never had a student produce finer on a first attempt, I don't think even you, Severus --\" \"Really?\" said Snape quietly, his eyes still boring into Harry, who felt a certain disquiet. The last thing he wanted was for Snape to start investigating the source of his newfound brilliance at Potions. \"Remind me what other subjects you're taking, Harry?\" asked Slughorn . \"Defense Against the D ark Arts, Charms, Transfiguration , Herbology...\" \"All the subjects required, in short, for an Auror ,\" said Snap e with the faintest sneer. \"Yeah, well, that's what I'd like to do,\" said Harry defiantly. \"And a great one you'll make too!\" boomed Slughorn. \"I don't think you should be an Auror, Harry,\" said Luna unex pectedly. Everybody looked at her. \"The Aurors are part of the Rotfang Conspiracy, I thought everyone knew that. They're planning to bring down the Ministry of Magic from within using a c om bination of Dark Magic and gum disease.\" Harry inhaled half his mead up his nose as he started to lau gh. Really, it had been worth bringing Luna just for this. Emerging, from his goblet, coughing, sopping wet but still grinning, he saw something calculated to raise his spirits even higher: Draco Malf o y being dragged by the ear toward them by Argus Filch. \"Professor Slughorn,\" wheezed Filch, his jowls aquiver and the maniacal light of mischief-detection in his bulging eyes, \"I discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor. He claims to have been invited to your party and to have been delayed in setting out. Did you issue him with an invitation?\" Malfoy pulled himself free of Filchs grip, looking furious. \"All right, I wasn't invited!\" he said angrily. \"I was trying to gate crash, happy?\" \"No, I'm not!\" said Filch, a statement at complete odds with the glee on his face. \"You're in trouble, you are! Didn't the headma ster say that nighttime prowling ' s out, unless you've got permission, didn't he, eh?\" \"That's all right, Argus, that's all right,\" said Slughorn, waving it 1.1 nd. \"It's Christmas, and it's not a crime to want to come to a party . Just this once, we'll forget any punishment; you may stay , Draco. Fil ich's expression of outraged disappointment was perfectly pre di c t able; but why, Harry wondered, watching him, did Malfoy look almost equally unhappy? And why was Snape looking at Mal-foy as though both angry and . . . was it p ossible? ... a lit tl afraid? But almost before Harry had registered what he had seen, Filch had turned and shuffled away, muttering under his breath; Malfoy h ad composed his face into a smile and was thanking Slughorn for his generosity, and Snape's face was smoothly inscrutable again. \"It's nothing, nothing,\" said Slughorn, waving away Malfoy's t hanks. \"I did know your grandfather, after all....\" \"He always spoke very highly of you, sir,\" said Malfoy quickly. \"Said you were the best potion-maker he'd ever known. ...\" Harry stared at Malfoy. It was not the sucking-up that intrigued him; he had watched Malfoy do that to Snape for a long time. It was the fact that Malfoy did, after all, look a little ill. This was the first time he had seen Malfoy close up for ages; he now saw that Malfoy had dark shadows under his eyes and a distinctly grayish tinge to his skin. \"I'd like a word with you, Draco,\" said Snape suddenly. \"Now , Severus,\" said Slughorn, hiccuping again, \"it's Christ mas, do n't be too hard --\" \"I am his Head of House, and I shall decide how hard, or other-wise, to be,\" said Snape curtly. \"Follow me, Draco.\" They left, Snape leading the way, Malfoy looking resentful. Harry stood there for a moment, irresolute, then said, \"I'll be back in a bit, Luna -- er -- bathroom.\" \"All right,\" she said cheerfully, and he thought he heard her, as he hurried off into the crowd, resume the subject of the Rotfang Conspiracy with Professor Trelawney, who seemed sincerely in terested. It was easy, once out of the party, to pull his Invisibility Cloak out of his pocket and throw it over himself, for the corridor was quite deserted. What was more difficult was finding Snape and Malfoy. Harry ran down the corridor, the noise of his feet masked by the music and loud talk still issuing from Slughorn's office behind him. Perhaps Snape had taken Malfoy to his office in the dungeons ... or perhaps he was escorting him back to the Slyt herin common room. . . . Harry pressed his ear against door after door as he dashed down the corridor until, with a great jolt of excitement, he crouched down to the keyhole of the last classroom in the corridor and heard voices. \" . . . cannot afford mistakes, Draco, because if you are expelled --\" \"I didn't have anything to do with it, all right?\" \"I hope you are telling the truth, because it was both clumsy a nd foolish. Already you are suspected of having a hand in it.\" \"Who suspects me?\" said Malfoy angrily. \"For the last time, I didn't do it, okay? That Bell girl must ' ve had an enemy no on e knows about -- don't look at me like that! I know what you're do-ing, I'm not stupid, but it won't work -- I can stop you!\" There was a pause and then Snape said quietly, \"Ah . . . Aunt Bellatrix has been teaching you Occlumency, I see. What thoughts are you trying to conceal from your master, Draco?\" \"I'm not trying to conceal anything from him, I just don't want you butting in !\" Harry pressed his ear still more closely against the keyhole. . . . What had happened to make Malfoy speak to Snape like this -- Snape, toward whom he had always shown respect, even liking? \"So that is why you have been avoiding me this term? You have feared my interference? You realize that, had anybody else failed to come to my office when I had told them repeatedly to be there, Draco --\" \"So put me in detention! Report me to Dumbledore!\" jeered Malfoy. There was another pause. Then Snape said, \"You know perfectly well that I do not wish to do either of those things .\" \"You'd better stop telling me to come to your office then!\" \"Listen to me,\" said Snape, his voice so low now that Harry had to push his ear very hard against the keyhole to hear. \"I am trying to help you. I swore to your mother I would protect you. I made the Unbreakable Vow, Draco --\" \"Looks like you'll have to break it, then, because I don't need your protection! It's my job, he gave it to me and I'm doing it, I've got a plan and it's going to work, it's just taking a bit longer than I thought it would!\" \"What is your plan ?\" \"It's none of your business !\" \" If you tell me what you are trying to do, I can assist you ...\" \"I have all the assistance I need, thanks, I'm not alone!\" \"You were certainly alone tonight, which was foolish in the ex-treme, wandering the corridors without lookouts or backup, these are elementary mistakes --\" \"I would've had Crabbe and Goyle with me if you hadn't put them in detention!\" \"Keep your voice down!\" spat Snape, for Malfoy ' s voice had risen excitedly. \"If your friends Crabbe and Goyle intend to pass their Defense Against the Dark Arts OWL this time around, they will need to work a little harder than they are doing at pres --\" \"What does it matter?\" said Malfoy. \"Defense Against the Dark Arts -- its all just a joke, isn't it, an act? Like any of us need pro-tecting against the Dark Arts --\" \"It is an act that is crucial to success, Draco!\" said Snape. \"Where do you think I would have been all these years, if I had not known how to act? Now listen to me! You are being incautious, wandering around at night, getting yourself caught, and if you are placing your reliance in assistants like Crabbe and Goyle --\" \"They're not the only ones, I've got other people on my side, better people!\" \"Then why not confide in me, and I can --\" \"I know what you're up to! You want to steal my glory!\" There was another pause, then Snape said coldly, \"You are speaking like a child. I quite understand that your fathers capture and imprisonment has upset you, but --\" Harry had barely a second ' s warning; he heard Malfoy's footsteps on the other side of the door and flung himself out of the way just as it burst open . Malfoy was striding away down the corridor, past the open door of Slughorns office, around the distant corner, and out of sight. Hardly daring to breathe, Harry remained crouched down as Snape emerged slowly from the classroom. His expression unfath-omable, he returned to the party. Harry remained on the floor, hid-den beneath the cloak, his mind racing. \n",

            ": The Hour of Gaunt For or the rest of the week's Potions lessons Harry continued to follow the Half-Blood Prince's instructions wherever they deviated from Libatius Borage's, with the result that by their fourth lesson Slughorn was raving about Harrys abilities, saying that he had rarely taught anyone so talented. Neither Ron nor Hermione was delighted by this. Although Harry had offered to share his book with both of them, Ron had more difficulty deciphering the handwriting than Harry did, and could not keep asking Harry to read aloud or it might look suspicious. Hermione, meanwhile, was resolutely plowing on with what she called the \"official\" instructions, but becoming increasingly bad-tempered as they yielded poorer results than the Prince's. Harry wondered vaguely who the Half-Blood Prince had been. Although the amount of homework they had been given prevented him from reading the whole of his copy of Advanced Potion-Making, he had skimmed through it sufficiently to see that there was barely a page on which the Prince had not made additional notes, not all of them concerned with potion-making. Here and there were directions for what looked like spells that the Prince had made up himself. \"Or herself,\" said Hermione irritably, overhearing Harry pointing some of these out to Ron in the common room on Saturday evening. \"It might have been a girl. I think the handwriting looks more like a girl's than a boy's.\" \"The Half-Blood Prince, he was called,\" Harry said. \"How many girls have been Princes?\" Hermione seemed to have no answer to this. She merely scowled and twitched her essay on The Principles of Rematerialization away from Ron, who was trying to read it upside down. Harry looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old copy of Advanced Potion-Making back into his bag. \"It's five to eight, I'd better go, I'll be late for Dumbledore.\" \"Ooooh!\" gasped Hermione, looking up at once. \"Good luck! We'll wait up, we want to hear what he teaches you!\" \"Hope it goes okay,\" said Ron, and the pair of them watched Harry leave through the portrait hole. Harry proceeded through deserted corridors, though he had to step hastily behind a statue when Professor Trelawney appeared around a corner, muttering to herself as she shuffled a pack of dirty-looking playing cards, reading them as she walked. \"Two of spades: conflict,\" she murmured, as she passed the place where Harry crouched, hidden. \"Seven of spades: an ill omen. Ten of spades: violence. Knave of spades: a dark young man, possibly troubled, one who dislikes the questioner --\" She stopped dead, right on the other side of Harry's statue. \"Well, that can't be right,\" she said, annoyed, and Harry heard her reshuffling vigorously as she set off again, leaving nothing but a whiff of cooking sherry behind her. Harry waited until he was quite sure she had gone, then hurried off again until he reached the spot in the seventh-floor corridor where a single gargoyle stood against the wall. \"Acid Pops,\" said Harry, and the gargoyle leapt aside; the wall behind it slid apart, and a moving spiral stone staircase was revealed, onto which Harry stepped, so that he was carried in smooth circles up to the door with the brass knocker that led to Dumbledore's Office. Harry knocked. \"Come in,\" said Dumbledore s voice. \"Good evening, sir,\" said Harry, walking into the headmaster's office. \"Ah, good evening, Harry. Sit down,\" said Dumbledore, smiling. \"I hope you've had an enjoyable first week back at school?\" \"Yes, thanks, sir,\" said Harry. \"You must have been busy, a detention under your belt already!\" \"Er,\" began Harry awkwardly, but Dumbledore did not look too stern. \"I have arranged with Professor Snape that you will do your detention next Saturday instead.\" \"Right,\" said Harry, who had more pressing matters on his mind than Snapes detention, and now looked around surreptitiously for some indication of what Dumbledore was planning to do with him this evening. The circular office looked just as it always did; the delicate silver instruments stood on spindle-legged tables, puff-ing smoke and whirring; portraits of previous headmasters and headmistresses dozed in their frames, and Dumbledore's magnificent phoenix, Fawkes, stood on his perch behind the door, watching Harry with bright interest. It did not even look as though Dumbledore had cleared a space for dueling practice. \"So, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, in a businesslike voice. \"You have been wondering, I am sure, what I have planned for you during these -- for want of a better word -- lessons?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Well, I have decided that it is time, now that you know what prompted Lord Voldemort to try and kill you fifteen years ago, for you to be given certain information.\" There was a pause. \"You said, at the end of last term, you were going to tell me everything,\" said Harry. It was hard to keep a note of accusation from his voice. \"Sir,\" he added. \"And so I did,\" said Dumbledore placidly. \"I told you everything I know. From this point forth, we shall be leaving the firm foundation of fact and journeying together through the murky marshes of memory into thickets of wildest guesswork. From here on in, Harry, I may be as woefully wrong as Humphrey Belcher, who believed the time was ripe for a cheese cauldron.\" \"But you think you're right?\" said Harry. \"Naturally I do, but as I have already proven to you, I make mistakes like the next man. In fact, being -- forgive me -- rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.\" \"Sir,\" said Harry tentatively, \"does what you're going to tell me have anything to do with the prophecy? Will it help me . . . survive?\" \"It has a very great deal to do with the prophecy,\" said Dumbledore, as casually as if Harry had asked him about the next days weather, \"and I certainly hope that it will help you to survive.\" Dumbledore got to his feet and walked around the desk, past Harry, who turned eagerly in his seat to watch Dumbledore bending over the cabinet beside the door. When Dumbledore straightened up, he was holding a familiar shallow stone basin etched with odd markings around its rim. He placed the Pensieve on the desk in front of Harry. \"You look worried.\" Harry had indeed been eyeing the Pensieve with some apprehension. His previous experiences with the odd device that stored and revealed thoughts and memories, though highly instructive, had also been uncomfortable. The last time he had disturbed its contents, he had seen much more than he would have wished. But Dumbledore was smiling. \"This time, you enter the Pensieve with me . . . and, even more unusually, with permission.\" \"Where are we going, sir?\" \"For a trip down Bob Ogden's memory lane,\" said Dumbledore, pulling from his pocket a crystal bottle containing a swirling silvery-white substance. \"Who was Bob Ogden?\" \"He was employed by the Department of Magical Law Enforcement,\" said Dumbledore. \"He died some time ago, but not before I had tracked him down and persuaded him to confide these recollections to me. We are about to accompany him on a visit he made in the course of his duties. If you will stand, Harry ...\" But Dumbledore was having difficulty pulling out the stopper of the crystal bottle: His injured hand seemed stiff and painful. \"Shall --shall I, sir?\" \"No matter, Harry --\" Dumbledore pointed his wand at the bottle and the cork flew out. \"Sir -- how did you injure your hand?\" Harry asked again, looking at the blackened fingers with a mixture of revulsion and pity. \"Now is not the moment for that story, Harry. Not yet. We have an appointment with Bob Ogden.\" Dumbledore tipped the silvery contents of the bottle into the Pensieve, where they swirled and shimmered, neither liquid nor gas. \"After you,\" said Dumbledore, gesturing toward the bowl. Harry bent forward, took a deep breath, and plunged his face into the silvery substance. He felt his feet leave the office floor; he was falling, falling through whirling darkness and then, quite sud-denly, he was blinking in dazzling sunlight. Before his eyes had adjusted, Dumbledore landed beside him. They were standing in a country lane bordered by high, tangled hedgerows, beneath a summer sky as bright and blue as a forget-me-not. Some ten feet in front of them stood a short, plump man wearing enormously thick glasses that reduced his eyes to molelike specks. He was reading a wooden signpost that was sticking out of the brambles on the left-hand side of the road. Harry knew this must be Ogden; he was the only person in sight, and he was also wearing the strange assortment of clothes so often chosen by inexperienced wizards trying to look like Muggles: in this case, a frock coat and spats over a striped one-piece bathing costume. Before Harry had time to do more than register his bizarre appearance, however, Ogden had set off at a brisk walk down the lane. Dumbledore and Harry followed. As they passed the wooden sign, Harry looked up at its two arms. The one pointing back the way they had come read: Great Hangleton, 5 miles. The arm pointing after Ogden said Little Hangleton, 1 mile. They walked a short way with nothing to see but the hedgerows, the wide blue sky overhead and the swishing, frock-coated figure ahead. Then the lane curved to the left and fell away, sloping steeply down a hillside, so that they had a sudden, unexpected view of a whole valley laid out in front of them. Harry could see a village, undoubtedly Little Hangleton, nestled between two steep hills, its church and graveyard clearly visible. Across the valley, set on the opposite hillside, was a handsome manor house surrounded by a wide expanse of velvety green lawn. Ogden had broken into a reluctant trot due to the steep downward slope. Dumbledore lengthened his stride, and Harry hurried to keep up. He thought Little Hangleton must be their final destination and wondered, as he had done on the night they had found Slughorn, why they had to approach it from such a distance. He soon discovered that he was mistaken in thinking that they were going to the village, however. The lane curved to the right and when they rounded the corner, it was to see the very edge of Ogden's frock coat vanishing through a gap in the hedge. Dumbledore and Harry followed him onto a narrow dirt track bordered by higher and wilder hedgerows than those they had left behind. The path was crooked, rocky, and potholed, sloping down-hill like the last one, and it seemed to be heading for a patch of dark trees a little below them. Sure enough, the track soon opened up at the copse, and Dumbledore and Harry came to a halt behind Ogden, who had stopped and drawn his wand. Despite the cloudless sky, the old trees ahead cast deep, dark, cool shadows, and it was a few seconds before Harry's eyes discerned the building half-hidden amongst the tangle of trunks. It seemed to him a very strange location to choose for a house, or else an odd decision to leave the trees growing nearby, blocking all light and the view of the valley below. He wondered whether it was inhabited; its walls were mossy and so many tiles had fallen off the roof that the rafters were visible in places. Nettles grew all around it, their tips reaching the windows, which were tiny and thick with grime. Just as he had concluded that nobody could possibly live there, however, one of the windows was thrown open with a clatter, and a thin trickle of steam or smoke issued from it, as though somebody was cooking. Ogden moved forward quietly and, it seemed to Harry, rather cautiously. As the dark shadows of the trees slid over him, he stopped again, staring at the front door, to which somebody had nailed a dead snake. Then there was a rustle and a crack, and a man in rags dropped from the nearest tree, landing on his feet right in front of Ogden, who leapt backward so fast he stood on the tails of his frock coat and stumbled. \"You're not welcome.\" The man standing before them had thick hair so matted with dirt it could have been any color. Several of his teeth were missing. His eyes were small and dark and stared in opposite directions. He might have looked comical, but he did not; the effect was frighten-ing, and Harry could not blame Ogden for backing away several more paces before he spoke. \"Er -- good morning. I'm from the Ministry of Magic --\" \"You're not welcome.\" \"Er -- I'm sorry -- I don't understand you,\" said Ogden nervously. Harry thought Ogden was being extremely dim; the stranger was making himself very clear in Harry's opinion, particularly as he was brandishing a wand in one hand and a short and rather bloody knife in the other. \"You understand him, I'm sure, Harry?\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"Yes, of course,\" said Harry, slightly nonplussed. \"Why can't Ogden -- ?\" But as his eyes found the dead snake on the door again, he suddenly understood. \"He's speaking Parseltongue?\" \"Very good,\" said Dumbledore, nodding and smiling. The man in rags was now advancing on Ogden, knife in one hand, wand in the other. \"Now, look --\" Ogden began, but too late: There was a bang, and Ogden was on the ground, clutching his nose, while a nasty yellowish goo squirted from between his fingers. \"Morfin!\" said a loud voice. An elderly man had come hurrying out of the cottage, banging the door behind him so that the dead snake swung pathetically. This man was shorter than the first, and oddly proportioned; his shoulders were very broad and his arms overlong, which, with his bright brown eyes, short scrubby hair, and wrinkled face, gave him the look of a powerful, aged monkey. He came to a halt beside the man with the knife, who was now cackling with laughter at the sight of Ogden on the ground. \"Ministry, is it?\" said the older man, looking down at Ogden. \"Correct!\" said Ogden angrily, dabbing his face. \"And you, I take it, are Mr. Gaunt?\" \"S'right,\" said Gaunt. \"Got you in the face, did he?\" \"Yes, he did!\" snapped Ogden. \"Should've made your presence known, shouldn't you?\" said Gaunt aggressively. \"This is private property. Can't just walk in here and not expect my son to defend himself.\" \"Defend himself against what, man?\" said Ogden, clambering back to his feet. \"Busybodies. Intruders. Muggles and filth.\" Ogden pointed his wand at his own nose, which was still issuing large amounts of what looked like yellow pus, and the flow stopped at once. Mr. Gaunt spoke out of the corner of his mouth to Morfin. \"Get in the house. Don't argue.\" This time, ready for it, Harry recognized Parseltongue; even while he could understand what was being said, he distinguished the weird hissing noise that was all Ogden could hear. Morfin seemed to be on the point of disagreeing, but when his father cast him a threatening look he changed his mind, lumbering away to the cottage with an odd rolling gait and slamming the front door behind him, so that the snake swung sadly again. \"It's your son I'm here to see, Mr. Gaunt,\" said Ogden, as he mopped the last of the pus from the front of his coat. \"That was Morfin, wasn't it?\" \"Ah, that was Morfin,\" said the old man indifferently. \"Are you pure-blood?\" he asked, suddenly aggressive. \"That's neither here nor there,\" said Ogden coldly, and Harry felt his respect for Ogden rise. Apparently Gaunt felt rather differently. He squinted into Ogden’s face and muttered, in what was clearly supposed to be an offensive tone, \"Now I come to think about it, I've seen noses like yours down in the village.\" \"I don't doubt it, if your son’s been let loose on them,\" said Ogden. \"Perhaps we could continue this discussion inside?\" \"Inside?\" \"Yes, Mr. Gaunt. I've already told you. I'm here about Morfin. We sent an owl --\" \"I've no use for owls,\" said Gaunt. \"I don't open letters.\" \"Then you can hardly complain that you get no warning of visitors,\" said Ogden tartly. \"I am here following a serious breach of Wizarding law, which occurred here in the early hours of this morning --\" \"All right, all right, all right!\" bellowed Gaunt. \"Come in the bleeding house, then, and much good it'll do you!\" The house seemed to contain three tiny rooms. Two doors led off the main room, which served as kitchen and living room com-bined. Morfin was sitting in a filthy armchair beside the smoking fire, twisting a live adder between his thick fingers and crooning softly at it in Parseltongue: Hissy, hissy, little snakey, Slither on the floor You be good to Morfin Or he'll nail you to the door. There was a scuffling noise in the corner beside the open window, and Harry realized that there was somebody else in the room, a girl whose ragged gray dress was the exact color of the dirty stone wall behind her. She was standing beside a steaming pot on a grimy black stove, and was fiddling around with the shelf of squalid-looking pots and pans above it. Her hair was lank and dull and she had a plain, pale, rather heavy face. Her eyes, like her brother's, stared in opposite directions. She looked a little cleaner than the two men, but Harry thought he had never seen a more defeated-looking person. \"M'daughter, Merope,\" said Gaunt grudgingly, as Ogden looked inquiringly toward her. \"Good morning,\" said Ogden. She did not answer, but with a frightened glance at her father turned her back on the room and continued shifting the pots on the shelf behind her. \"Well, Mr. Gaunt,\" said Ogden, \"to get straight to the point, we have reason to believe that your son, Morfin, performed magic in front of a Muggle late last night.\" There was a deafening clang. Merope had dropped one of the pots. \"Pick it up!\" Gaunt bellowed at her. \"That's it, grub on the floor like some filthy Muggle, what's your wand for, you useless sack of muck?\" \"Mr. Gaunt, please!\" said Ogden in a shocked voice, as Merope, who had already picked up the pot, flushed blotchily scarlet, lost her grip on the pot again, drew her wand shakily from her pocket, pointed it at the pot, and muttered a hasty, inaudible spell that caused the pot to shoot across the floor away from her, hit the opposite wall, and crack in two. Morfin let out a mad cackle of laughter. Gaunt screamed, \"Mend it, you pointless lump, mend it!\" Merope stumbled across the room, but before she had time to raise her wand, Ogden had lifted his own and said firmly, \"Reparo. \" The pot mended itself instantly. Gaunt looked for a moment as though he was going to shout at Ogden, but seemed to think better of it: Instead, he jeered at his daughter, \"Lucky the nice man from the Ministry's here, isn't it? Perhaps he'll take you off my hands, perhaps he doesn't mind dirty Squibs. . . .\" Without looking at anybody or thanking Ogden, Merope picked up the pot and returned it, hands trembling, to its shelf. She then stood quite still, her back against the wall between the filthy window and the stove, as though she wished for nothing more than to sink into the stone and vanish. \"Mr. Gaunt,\" Ogden began again, \"as I've said: the reason for my visit --\" \"I heard you the first time!\" snapped Gaunt. \"And so what? Morfin gave a Muggle a bit of what was coming to him -- what about it, then?\" \"Morfin has broken Wizarding law,\" said Ogden sternly. \"'Morfin has broken Wizarding law.'\" Gaunt imitated Ogden’s voice, making it pompous and singsong. Morfin cackled again. \"He taught a filthy Muggle a lesson, that's illegal now, is it?\" \"Yes,\" said Ogden. \"I'm afraid it is.\" He pulled from an inside pocket a small scroll of parchment and unrolled it. \"What's that, then, his sentence?\" said Gaunt, his voice rising angrily. \"It is a summons to the Ministry for a hearing --\" \"Summons! Summons? Who do you think you are, summoning my son anywhere?\" \"I'm Head of the Magical Law Enforcement Squad,\" said Ogden. \"And you think we're scum, do you?\" screamed Gaunt, advancing on Ogden now, with a dirty yellow-nailed finger pointing at his chest. \"Scum who'll come running when the Ministry tells 'em to? Do you know who you're talking to, you filthy little Mudblood, do you?\" \"I was under the impression that I was speaking to Mr. Gaunt,\" said Ogden, looking wary, but standing his ground. \"That's right!\" roared Gaunt. For a moment, Harry thought Gaunt was making an obscene hand gesture, but then realized that he was showing Ogden the ugly, black-stoned ring he was wearing on his middle finger, waving it before Ogden's eyes. \"See this? See this? Know what it is? Know where it came from? Centuries it's been in our family, that's how far back we go, and pure-blood all the way! Know how much I've been offered for this, with the Peverell coat of arms engraved on the stone?\" \"I've really no idea,\" said Ogden, blinking as the ring sailed within an inch of his nose, \"and it's quite beside the point, Mr. Gaunt. Your son has committed --\" With a howl of rage, Gaunt ran toward his daughter. For a split second, Harry thought he was going to throttle her as his hand flew to her throat; next moment, he was dragging her toward Ogden by a gold chain around her neck. \"See this?\" he bellowed at Ogden, shaking a heavy gold locket at him, while Merope spluttered and gasped for breath. \"I see it, I see it!\" said Ogden hastily. \"Slytherins!\" yelled Gaunt. \"Salazar Slytherin's! We're his last living descendants, what do you say to that, eh?\" \"Mr. Gaunt, your daughter!\" said Ogden in alarm, but Gaunt had already released Merope; she staggered away from him, back to her corner, massaging her neck and gulping for air. \"So!\" said Gaunt triumphantly, as though he had just proved a complicated point beyond all possible dispute. \"Don't you go talking to us as if we're dirt on your shoes! Generations of purebloods, wizards all -- more than you can say, I don't doubt!\" And he spat on the floor at Ogdens feet. Morfin cackled again. Merope, huddled beside the window, her head bowed and her face hidden by her lank hair, said nothing. \"Mr. Gaunt,\" said Ogden doggedly, \"I am afraid that neither your ancestors nor mine have anything to do with the matter in hand. I am here because of Morfin, Morfin and the Muggle he accosted late last night. Our information\" -- he glanced down at his scroll of parchment -- \"is that Morfin performed a jinx or hex on the said Muggle, causing him to erupt in highly painful hives.\" Morfin giggled. \"Be quiet, boy,\" snarled Gaunt in Parseltongue, and Morfin fell silent again. \"And so what if he did, then?\" Gaunt said defiantly to Ogden, \"I expect you've wiped the Muggle's filthy face clean for him, and his memory to boot--\" \"That's hardly the point, is it, Mr. Gaunt?\" said Ogden. \"This was an unprovoked attack on a defenseless --\" \"Ar, I had you marked out as a Muggle-lover the moment I saw you,\" sneered Gaunt, and he spat on the floor again. \"This discussion is getting us nowhere,\" said Ogden firmly. \"It is clear from your son's attitude that he feels no remorse for his actions.\" He glanced down at his scroll of parchment again. \"Morfin will attend a hearing on the fourteenth of September to answer the charges of using magic in front of a Muggle and causing harm and distress to that same Mugg --\" Ogden broke off. The jingling, clopping sounds of horses and loud, laughing voices were drifting in through the open window. Apparently the winding lane to the village passed very close to the copse where the house stood. Gaunt froze, listening, his eyes wide. Morfin hissed and turned his face toward the sounds, his expression hungry. Merope raised her head. Her face, Harry saw, was starkly white. \"My God, what an eyesore!\" rang out a girl's voice, as clearly audible through the open window as if she had stood in the room beside them. \"Couldn't your father have that hovel cleared away, Tom?\" \"It's not ours,\" said a young man's voice. \"Everything on the other side of the valley belongs to us, but that cottage belongs to an old tramp called Gaunt, and his children. The son's quite mad, you should hear some of the stories they tell in the village --\" The girl laughed. The jingling, clopping noises were growing louder and louder. Morfin made to get out of his armchair. \"Keep your seat,\" said his father warningly, in Parseltongue. \"Tom,\" said the girl's voice again, now so close they were clearly right beside the house, \"I might be wrong -- but has somebody nailed a snake to that door?\" \"Good lord, you're right!\" said the man's voice. \"That'll be the son, I told you he's not right in the head. Don't look at it, Cecilia, darling.\" The jingling and clopping sounds were now growing faint again. \"'Darling,'\" whispered Morfin in Parseltongue, looking at his sister. \"'Darling, he called her. So he wouldn't have you anyway.\" Merope was so white Harry felt sure she was going to faint. \"What's that?\" said Gaunt sharply, also in Parseltongue, looking from his son to his daughter. \"What did you say, Morfin?\" \"She likes looking at that Muggle,\" said Morfin, a vicious expression on his face as he stared at his sister, who now looked terrified. \"Always in the garden when he passes, peering through the hedge at him, isn't she? And last night -- \" Merope shook her head jerkily, imploringly, but Morfin went on ruthlessly, \"Hanging out of the window waiting for him to ride home, wasn't she?\" \"Hanging out of the window to look at a Muggle?\" said Gaunt quietly. All three of the Gaunts seemed to have forgotten Ogden, who was looking both bewildered and irritated at this renewed outbreak of incomprehensible hissing and rasping. \"Is it true?\" said Gaunt in a deadly voice, advancing a step or two toward the terrified girl. \"My daughter--pure-blooded descendant of Salazar Slytherin -- hankering after a filthy, dirt-veined Muggle?\" Merope shook her head frantically, pressing herself into the wall, apparently unable to speak. \"But I got him, Father!\" cackled Morfin. \"I got him as he went by and he didn't look so pretty with hives all over him, did he, Merope?\" \"You disgusting little Squib, you filthy little blood traitor!\" roared Gaunt, losing control, and his hands closed around his daughter's throat. Both Harry and Ogden yelled \"No!\" at the same time; Ogden raised his wand and cried, \"Relaskio!\" Gaunt was thrown backward, away from his daughter; he tripped over a chair and fell flat on his back. With a roar of rage, Morfin leapt out of his chair and ran at Ogden, brandishing his bloody knife and firing hexes indiscriminately from his wand. Ogden ran for his life. Dumbledore indicated that they ought to follow and Harry obeyed, Merope's screams echoing in his ears. Ogden hurtled up the path and erupted onto the main lane, his arms over his head, where he collided with the glossy chestnut horse ridden by a very handsome, dark-haired young man. Both he and the pretty girl riding beside him on a gray horse roared with laughter at the sight of Ogden, who bounced off the horse's flank and set off again, his frock coat flying, covered from head to foot in dust, running pell-mell up the lane. \"I think that will do, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. He took Harry by the elbow and tugged. Next moment, they were both soaring weightlessly through darkness, until they landed squarely on their feet, back in Dumbledore's now twilit office. \"What happened to the girl in the cottage?\" said Harry at once, as Dumbledore lit extra lamps with a flick of his wand. \"Merope, or whatever her name was?\" \"Oh, she survived,\" said Dumbledore, reseating himself behind his desk and indicating that Harry should sit down too. \"Ogden Apparated back to the Ministry and returned with reinforcements within fifteen minutes. Morfin and his father attempted to fight, but both were overpowered, removed from the cottage, and subsequently convicted by the Wizengamot. Morfin, who already had a record of Muggle attacks, was sentenced to three years in Azkaban. Marvolo, who had injured several Ministry employees in addition to Ogden, received six months.\" \"Marvolo?\" Harry repeated wonderingly. \"That's right,\" said Dumbledore, smiling in approval. \"I am glad to see you're keeping up.\" \"That old man was -- ?\" \"Voldemort's grandfather, yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"Marvolo, his son, Morfin, and his daughter, Merope, were the last of the Gaunts, a very ancient Wizarding family noted for a vein of instability and violence that flourished through the generations due to their habit of marrying their own cousins. Lack of sense coupled with a great liking for grandeur meant that the family gold was squandered several generations before Marvolo was born. He, as you saw, was left in squalor and poverty, with a very nasty temper, a fantastic amount of arrogance and pride, and a couple of family heirlooms that he treasured just as much as his son, and rather more than his daughter.\" \"So Merope,\" said Harry, leaning forward in his chair and star-ing at Dumbledore, \"so Merope was . . . Sir, does that mean she was . . . Voldemort's mother?\" \"It does,\" said Dumbledore. \"And it so happens that we also had a glimpse of Voldemort's father. I wonder whether you noticed?\" \"The Muggle Morfin attacked? The man on the horse?\" \"Very good indeed,\" said Dumbledore, beaming. \"Yes, that was Tom Riddle senior, the handsome Muggle who used to go riding past the Gaunt cottage and for whom Merope Gaunt cherished a secret, burning passion.\" \"And they ended up married?\" Harry said in disbelief, unable to imagine two people less likely to fall in love. \"I think you are forgetting,\" said Dumbledore, \"that Merope was a witch. I do not believe that her magical powers appeared to their best advantage when she was being terrorized by her father. Once Marvolo and Morfin were safely in Azkaban, once she was alone and free for the first time in her life, then, I am sure, she was able to give full rein to her abilities and to plot her escape from the desperate life she had led for eighteen years.\" \"Can you not think of any measure Merope could have taken to make Tom Riddle forget his Muggle companion, and fall in love with her instead?\" \"The Imperius Curse?\" Harry suggested. \"Or a love potion?\" \"Very good. Personally, I am inclined to think that she used a love potion. I am sure it would have seemed more romantic to her, and I do not think it would have been very difficult, some hot day, when Riddle was riding alone, to persuade him to take a drink of water. In any case, within a few months of the scene we have just witnessed, the village of Little Hangleton enjoyed a tremendous scandal. You can imagine the gossip it caused when the squire's son ran off with the tramp's daughter, Merope.\" \"But the villagers' shock was nothing to Marvolo's. He returned from Azkaban, expecting to find his daughter dutifully awaiting his return with a hot meal ready on his table. Instead, he found a clear inch of dust and her note of farewell, explaining what she had done.\" \"From all that I have been able to discover, he never mentioned her name or existence from that time forth. The shock of her desertion may have contributed to his early death -- or perhaps he had simply never learned to feed himself. Azkaban had greatly weakened Marvolo, and he did not live to see Morfin return to the cottage.\" \"And Merope? She ... she died, didn't she? Wasn't Voldemort brought up in an orphanage?\" \"Yes, indeed,\" said Dumbledore. \"We must do a certain amount of guessing here, although I do not think it is difficult to deduce what happened. You see, within a few months of their runaway marriage, Tom Riddle reappeared at the manor house in Little Hangleton without his wife. The rumor flew around the neighborhood that he was talking of being 'hoodwinked' and 'taken in.' What he meant, I am sure, is that he had been under an enchantment that had now lifted, though I daresay he did not dare use those precise words for fear of being thought insane. When they heard what he was saying, however, the villagers guessed that Merope had lied to Tom Riddle, pretending that she was going to have his baby, and that he had married her for this reason.\" \"But she did have his baby.\" \"But not until a year after they were married. Tom Riddle left her while she was still pregnant.\" \"What went wrong?\" asked Harry. \"Why did the love potion stop working?\" \"Again, this is guesswork,\" said Dumbledore, \"but I believe that Merope, who was deeply in love with her husband, could not bear to continue enslaving him by magical means. I believe that she made the choice to stop giving him the potion. Perhaps, besotted as she was, she had convinced herself that he would by now have fallen in love with her in return. Perhaps she thought he would stay for the baby's sake. If so, she was wrong on both counts. He left her, never saw her again, and never troubled to discover what became of his son.\" The sky outside was inky black and the lamps in Dumbledore's office seemed to glow more brightly than before. \"I think that will do for tonight, Harry,\" said Dumbledore after a moment or two. \"Yes, sir,\" said Harry. He got to his feet, but did not leave. \"Sir ... is it important to know all this about Voldemort's past?\" \"Very important, I think,\" said Dumbledore. \"And it... it's got something to do with the prophecy?\" \"It has everything to do with the prophecy.\" \"Right,\" said Harry, a little confused, but reassured all the same. He turned to go, then another question occurred to him, and he turned back again. \"Sir, am I allowed to tell Ron and Hermione everything you've told me?\" Dumbledore considered him for a moment, then said, \"Yes, I think Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger have proved themselves trust-worthy. But Harry, I am going to ask you to ask them not to repeat any of this to anybody else. It would not be a good idea if word got around how much I know, or suspect, about Lord Voldemort's secrets.\" \"No, sir, I'll make sure it's just Ron and Hermione. Good night.\" He turned away again, and was almost at the door when he saw it. Sitting on one of the little spindle-legged tables that supported so many frail-looking silver instruments, was an ugly gold ring set with a large, cracked, black stone. \"Sir,\" said Harry, staring at it. \"That ring--\" \"Yes?\" said Dumbledore. \"You were wearing it when we visited Professor Slughorn that night.\" \"So I was,\" Dumbledore agreed. \"But isn't it... sir, isn't it the same ring Marvolo Gaunt showed Ogden?\" Dumbledore bowed his head. \"The very same.\" \"But how come -- ? Have you always had it?\" \"No, I acquired it very recently,\" said Dumbledore. \"A few days before I came to fetch you from your aunt and uncle's, in fact.\" \"That would be around the time you injured your hand, then, sir?\" \"Around that time, yes, Harry.\" Harry hesitated. Dumbledore was smiling. \"Sir, how exactly -- ?\" \"Too late, Harry! You shall hear the story another time. Good night.\" \"Good night, sir.\" \n",

            ": The Half-Blood Prince Harry and Ron met Hermione in the common room before breakfast next morning. Hoping for some support in his theory, Harry lost no time in telling Hermione what he had overheard Malfoy saying on the Hogwarts Express. \"But he was obviously showing off for Parkinson, wasn't he?\" interjected Ron quickly, before Hermione could say anything. \"Well,\" she said uncertainly, \"I don't know. It would be like Malfoy to make himself seem more important than he is ... but that's a big lie to tell...\" \"Exactly,\" said Harry, but he could nor press the point, because so many people were trying to listen in to his conversation, not to mention staring at him and whispering behind their hands. \"It's rude to point,\" Ron snapped at a particularly minuscule first-year boy as they joined the queue to climb out of the portrait hole. The boy, who had been muttering something about Harry behind his hand to his friend, promptly turned scarlet and toppled out of the hole in alarm. Ron sniggered. \"I love being a sixth year. And were going to be getting free time this year. Whole periods when we can just sit up here and relax.\" \"We're going to need that time for studying, Ron!\" said Hermione, as they set off down the corridor. \"Yeah, but not today,\" said Ron. \"Today's going to be a real loss, I reckon.\" \"Hold it!\" said Hermione, throwing out an arm and halting a passing fourth year, who was attempting to push past her with a lime-green disk clutched tightly in his hand. \"Fanged Frisbees banned, hand it over,\" she told him sternly. The scowling boy handed over the snarling Frisbee, ducked under her arm, and took off after his friends. Ron waited for him to vanish, then tugged the Frisbee from Hermione's grip. \"Excellent, I've always wanted one of these.\" Hermione's remonstration was drowned by a loud giggle; Lavender Brown had apparently found Ron's remark highly amusing. She continued to laugh as she passed them, glancing back at Ron over her shoulder. Ron looked rather pleased with himself. The ceiling of the Great Hall was serenely blue and streaked with frail, wispy clouds, just like the squares of sky visible through the high mullioned windows. While they tucked into porridge and eggs and bacon, Harry and Ron told Hermione about their embarassing conversation with Hagrid the previous evening. \"But he can't really think we'd continue Care of Magical Creatures!\" she said, looking distressed. \"I mean, when has any of us expressed . . . you know . . . any enthusiasm?\" \"That's it, though, innit?\" said Ron, swallowing an entire fried egg whole. \"We were the ones who made the most effort in classes because we like Hagrid. But he thinks we liked the stupid subject. D'ya reckon anyone's going to go on to N.E.W.T.?\" Neither Harry nor Hermione answered; there was no need. They knew perfectly well that nobody in their year would want to continue Care of Magical Creatures. They avoided Hagrid's eye and returned his cheery wave only half-heartedly when he left the staff table ten minutes later. After they had eaten, they remained in their places, awaiting Professor McGonagall's descent from the staff table. The distribution of class schedules was more complicated than usual this year, for Professor McGonagall needed first to confirm that everybody had achieved the necessary O.W.L. grades to continue with their chosen N.E.W.T.s. Hermione was immediately cleared to continue with Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Herbology, Arithmancy, Ancient Runes, and Potions, and shot off to a first period Ancient Runes class without further ado. Neville took a little longer to sort out; his round face was anxious as Professor McGonagall looked down his application and then consulted his O.W.L results. \"Herbology, fine,\" she said. \"Professor Sprout will be delighted to see you back with an 'Outstanding' O.W.L. And you qualify for Defense Against the Dark Arts with 'Exceeds Expectations.' But the problem is Transfiguration. I'm sorry, Longbottom, but an 'Acceptable' really isn't good enough to continue to N.E.W.T. level. Just don't think you'd be able to cope with the coursework.\" Neville hung his head. Professor McGonagall peered at him through her square spectacles. \"Why do you want to continue with Transfiguration, anyway? I've never had the impression that you particularly enjoyed it.\" Neville looked miserable and muttered something about \"my grandmother wants.\" \"Hmph,\" snorted Professot McGonagall. \"It's high time your grandmother learned to be proud of the grandson she's got, rather than the one she thinks she ought to have - particularly after what happened at the Ministry.\" Neville turned very pink and blinked confusedly; Professor McGonagall had never paid him a compliment before. \"I'm sorry, Longbottom, but I cannot let you into my N.E.W.T. class. I see that you have an 'Exceeds Expectations' in Charm however - why not try for a N.E.W.T. in Charms?\" \"My grandmother thinks Charms is a soft option,\" mumbled Neville. \"Take Charms,\" said Professor McGonagall, \"and I shall drop Augusta a line reminding her that just because she failed her Charms O.W.L., the subject is not necessarily worthless.\" Smiling slightly at the look of delighted incredulity on Neville's face, Professor McGonagall tapped a blank schedule with the tip of her wand and handed it, now carrying details of his new classes, to Neville. Professor McGonagall turned next to Parvati Patil, whose first question was whether Firenze, the handsome centaur, was still teaching Divination. \"He and Professor Trelawney are dividing classes between them this year,\" said Professor McGonagall, a hint of disapproval in her voice; it was common knowledge that she despised the subject of Divination. \"The sixth year is being taken by Professor Trelawney.\" Parvati set off for Divination five minutes later looking slightly crestfallen. \"So, Potter, Potter . . .\" said Professor McGonagall, consulting her notes as she turned to Harry. \"Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Herbology, Transfiguration ... all fine. I must say, I was pleased with your Transfiguration mark, Potter, very pleased. Now, why haven't you applied to continue with Potions? I thought it was your ambition to become an Auror?\" \"It was, but you told me I had to get an 'Outstanding' in my O.W.L., Professor.\" \"And so you did when Professor Snape was teaching the subject. Professor Slughorn, however, is perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T. students with 'Exceeds Expectations' at O.W.L. Do you wish to proceed with Potions?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry, \"but I didn't buy the books or any ingredients or anything-\" \"I'm sure Professor Slughorn will be able to lend you some,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Very well, Potter, here is your schedule. Oh, by the way- twenty hopefuls have already put down their names for the Gryffindor Quidditch team. I shall pass the list to you in due course and you can fix up trials at your leisure.\" A few minutes later, Ron was cleared to do the same subjects as Harry, and the two of them left the table together. \"Look,\" said Ron delightedly, gazing ar his schedule, \"we've got a free period now. . . and a free period after break . . . and after lunch . . . excellent.\" They returned to the common room, which was empty apart from a half dozen seventh years, including Katie Bell, the only remaining member of the original Gryffindor Quidditch team that Harry had joined in his first year. \"I thought you'd get that, well done,\" she called over, pointing at the Captains badge on Harry's chest. \"Tell me when you call trials!\" \"Don't be stupid,\" said Harry, \"you don't need to try out, I watched you play for five years. . . .\" \"You mustn't start off like that,\" she said warningly. \"For all you know, there's someone much better than me out there. Good teams have been ruined before now because Captains just kept playing the old faces, or letting in their friends....\" Ron looked a little uncomfortable and began playing with the Fanged Frisbee Hermione had taken from the fourth-year student. It zoomed around the common room, snarling and attempting to take bites of the tapestry. Crookshanks's yellow eyes followed it and he hissed when it came too close. An hour later they reluctantly left the sunlit common room for the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom four floors below. Hermione was already queuing outside, carrying an armful of heavy books and looking put-upon. \"We got so much homework for Runes,\" she said anxiously when Harry and Ron joined her. \"A fifteen-inch essay, two translations, and I've got to read these by Wednesday!\" \"Shame,\" yawned Ron. \"You wait,\" she said resentfully. \"I bet Snape gives us loads.\" The classroom door opened as she spoke, and Snape stepped into the corridor, his sallow face framed as ever by two curtains of greasy black hair. Silence fell over the queue immediately. \"Inside,\" he said. Harry looked around as they entered. Snape had imposed his personality upon the room already; it was gloomier than usual, as curtains had been drawn over the windows, and was lit by candlelight. New pictures adorned the walls, many of them showing people who appeared to be in pain, sporting grisly injuries or strangely contorted body parts. Nobody spoke as they settled down, looking around at the shadowy, gruesome pictures. \"I have not asked you to take out your books,\" said Snape, closing the door and moving to face the class from behind his desk; Hermione hastily dropped her copy of Confronting the Faceless back into her bag and stowed it under her chair. \"I wish to speak to you, and I want your fullest attention.\" His black eyes roved over their upturned faces, lingering for a fraction of a second longer on Harry's than anyone else's. \"You have had five teachers in this subject so far, I believe.\" You believe . . . like you haven't watched them all come and go, hoping you'd be next, thought Harry scathingly. \"Naturally, these teachers will all have had their own methods and priorities. Given this confusion I am surprised so many of you scraped an O.W.L. in this subject. I shall be even more surprised if all of you manage to keep up with the N.E.W.T. work, which will be more advanced.\" Snape set off around the edge of the room, speaking now in a lower voice; the class craned their necks to keep him in view. \"The Dark Arts,\" said Snape, \"are many, varied, ever-changing, and eternal. Fighting them is like fighting a many-headed monster, which, each time a neck is severed, sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than before. You are fighting that which is unfixed, mutating, indestructible.\" Harry stared at Snape. It was surely one thing to respect the Dark Arts as a dangerous enemy, another to speak of them, as Snape was doing, with a loving caress in his voice? \"Your defenses,\" said Snape, a little louder, \"must therefore be as flexible and inventive as the arts you seek to undo. These pictures\" - he indicated a few of them as he swept past - \"give a fair representation of what happens to those who suffer, for instance, the Cruciatus Curse\" - he waved a hand toward a witch who was clearly shrieking in agony - \"feel the Dementor's Kiss\" - a wizard lying huddled and blank-eyed, slumped against a wall - \"or provoke the aggression of the Inferius\" - a bloody mass upon ground. \"Has an Inferius been seen, then?\" said Parvati Patil in a high pitched voice. \"Is it definite, is he using them?\" \"The Dark Lord has used Inferi in the past,\" said Snape, \"which means you would be well-advised to assume he might use them again. Now. . . \" He set off again around the other side of the classroom toward his desk, and again, they watched him as he walked, his dark robes billowing behind him. , \". . . you are, I believe, complete novices in the use of nonverbal spells. What is the advantage of a nonverbal spell?\" Hermione's hand shot into the air. Snape took his time looking around at everybody else, making sure he had no choice, before saying curtly, \"Very well - Miss Granger?\" \"Your adversary has no warning about what kind of magic you're about to perform,\" said Hermione, \"which gives you a split-second advantage.\" \"An answer copied almost word for word from The Standard Book of Spells, Grade Six,\" said Snape dismissively (over in the corner, Malfoy sniggered), \"but correct in essentials. Yes, those who progress in using magic without shouting incantations gain an element of surprise in their spell-casting. Not all wizards can do this, of course; it is a question of concentration and mind power which some\" - his gaze lingered maliciously upon Harry once more - \"lack.\" Harry knew Snape was thinking of their disastrous Occlumency lessons of the previous year. He refused to drop his gaze, but glowered at Snape until Snape looked away. \"You will now divide,\" Snape went on, \"into pairs. One partner will attempt to jinx the other without speaking. The other will attempt to repel the jinx in equal silence. Carry on.\" Although Snape did not know it, Harry had taught at least half the class (everyone who had been a member of the D.A.) how to perform a Shield Charm the previous year. None of them had ever cast the charm without speaking, however. A reasonable amount of cheating ensued; many people were merely whispering the incantation instead of saying it aloud. Typically, ten minutes into the lesson Hermione managed to repel Neville's muttered Jelly-Legs Jinx without uttering a single word, a feat that would surely have earned her twenty points for Gryffindor from any reasonable teacher, thought Harry bitterly, but which Snape ignored. He swept between them as they practiced, looking just as much like an overgrown bat as ever, lingering to watch Harry and Ron struggling with the task. Ron, who was supposed to be jinxing Harry, was purple in the face, his lips tightly compressed to save himself from the temptation of muttering the incantation. Harry had his wand raised, waiting on tenterhooks to repel a jinx that seemed unlikely ever to come. \"Pathetic, Weasley,\" said Snape, after a while. \"Here -- let me show you-\" He turned his wand on Harry so fast that Harry reacted instinctively; all thought of nonverbal spells forgotten, he yelled, \"Protego!\" His Shield Charm was so strong Snape was knocked off-balance and hit a desk. The whole class had looked around and now watched as Snape righted himself, scowling. \"Do you remember me telling you we are practicing nonverbal spells, Potter?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry stiffly. \"Yes, sir.\" \"There's no need to call me 'sir,' Professor.\" The words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying. Several people gasped, including Hermione. Behind Snape, however, Ron, Dean, and Seamus grinned appreciatively. \"Detention, Saturday night, my office,\" said Snape. \"I do not take cheek from anyone, Potter . . . not even 'the Chosen One.'\" \"That was brilliant, Harry!\" chortled Ron, once they were safely on their way to break a short while later. \"You really shouldn't have said it,\" said Hermione, frowning at Ron. \"What made you?\" \"He tried to jinx me, in case you didn't notice!\" fumed Harry. I had enough of that during those Occlumency lessons! Why doesn't he use another guinea pig for a change? What's Dumbledore playing at, anyway, letting him teach Defense? Did you hear him talking about the Dark Arts? He loves them! All that unfixed, indestructble stuff –\" \"Well,\" said Hermione, \"I thought he sounded a bit like you.\" \"Like me?\" \"Yes, when you were telling us what it's like to face Voldemort. You said it wasn't just memorizing a bunch of spells, you said it was just you and your brains and your guts - well, wasn't that what Snape was saying? That it really comes down to being brave and quick-thinking?\" Harry was so disarmed that she had thought his words as well worth memorizing as The Standard Book of Spells that he did not argue. \"Harry! Hey, Harry!\" Harry looked around; Jack Sloper, one of the Beaters on last year's Gryffindor Quidditch team, was hurrying toward him holding a roll of parchment. \"For you,\" panted Sloper. \"Listen, I heard you're the new Captain. When're you holding trials?\" \"I'm not sure yet,\" said Harry, thinking privately that Sloper would be very lucky to get back on the team. \"I'll let you know.\" \"Oh, right. I was hoping it'd be this weekend -\" \"But Harry was not listening; he had just recognized the thin, slanting writing on the parchment. Leaving Sloper in mid-sentence, he hurried away with Ron and Hermione, unrolling the parchment as he went. Dear Harry, I would like to start our private lessons this Saturday. Kindly come along to my office at 8 P.M. I hope you are enjoying your first day back at school. Yours sincerely, Albus Dumbledore P.S. I enjoy Acid Pops. \"He enjoys Acid Pops?\" said Ron, who had read the message over Harry's shoulder and was looking perplexed. \"It's the password to get past the gargoyle outside his study,\" said Harry in a low voice. \"Ha! Snape's not going to be pleased. . . . I won't be able to do his detention!\" He, Ron, and Hermione spent the whole of break speculating on what Dumbledore would teach Harry. Ron thought it most likely to be spectacular jinxes and hexes of the type the Death Eaters would not know. Hermione said such things were illegal, and thought it much more likely that Dumbledore wanted to teach Harry advanced Defensive magic. After break, she went off to Arithmancy while Harry and Ron returned to the common room where they grudgingly started Snape's homework. This turned out to be so complex that they still had not finished when Hermione joined them for their after-lunch free period (though she considerably speeded up the process). They had only just finished when the bell rang for the afternoon's double Potions and they beat the familiar path down to the dungeon classroom that had, for so long, been Snape's. When they arrived in the corridor they saw that there were only a dozen people progressing to N.E.W.T. level. Crabbe and Goyle had evidently failed to achieve the required O.W.L. grade, but four Slytherins had made it through, including Malfoy. Four Ravenclaws were there, and one Hufflepuff, Ernie Macmillan, whom Harry liked despite his rather pompous manner. \"Harry,\" Ernie said portentously, holding out his hand as Harry approached, \"didn't get a chance to speak in Defense Against The Dark Arts this morning. Good lesson, I thought, but Shield Charms are old hat, of course, for us old D.A. lags . . . And how are you, Ron -- Hermione?\" Before they could say more than \"fine,\" the dungeon door opened and Slughorn's belly preceded him out of the door. As they filed into the room, his great walrus mustache curved above his beaming mouth, and he greeted Harry and Zabini with particular enthusiasm. The dungeon was, most unusually, already full of vapors and odd smells. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sniffed interestedly as they passed large, bubbling cauldrons. The four Slytherins took a table together, as did the four Ravenclaws. This left Harry, Ron, and Hermione to share a table with Ernie. They chose the one nearest a gold-colored cauldron that was emitting one of the most seductive scents Harry had ever inhaled: Somehow it reminded him simultaneously of treacle tart, the woody smell of a broomstick handle, and something flowery he thought he might have smelled at the Burrow. He found that he was breathing very slowly and deeply and that the potion's fumes seemed to be filling him up like drink. A great contentment stole over him; he grinned across at Ron, who grinned back lazily. \"Now then, now then, now then,\" said Slughorn, whose massive outline was quivering through the many shimmering vapors. \"Scales out, everyone, and potion kits, and don't forget your copies of Advanced Potion-Making. . . .\" \"Sir?\" said Harry, raising his hand. \"Harry, m'boy?\" \"I haven't got a book or scales or anything - nor's Ron - we didn't realize we'd be able to do the N.E.W.T., you see -\" \"Ah, yes, Professor McGonagall did mention . . . not to worry, my dear boy, not to worry at all. You can use ingredients from the store cupboard today, and I'm sure we can lend you some scales, and we've got a small stock of old books here, they'll do until you can write to Flourish and Blotts. . . .\" Slughorn strode over to a corner cupboard and, after a moment's foraging, emerged with two very battered-looking copies of Advanced Potion-Making by Libatius Borage, which he gave to Harry and Ron along with two sets of tarnished scales. \"Now then,\" said Slughorn, returning to the front of the class and inflating his already bulging chest so that the buttons on his waistcoat threatened to burst off, \"I've prepared a few potions for you to have a look at, just out of interest, you know. These are the kind of thing you ought to be able to make after completing your N.E.W.T.s. You ought to have heard of 'em, even if you haven't made 'em yet. Anyone tell me what this one is?\" He indicated the cauldron nearest the Slytherin table. Harry raised himself slighty in his seat and saw what looked like plain water boiling away inside it. Hermione's well-practiced hand hit the air before anybody else's; Slughorn pointed at her. \"It's Veritaserum, a colorless, odorless potion thar forces the drinker to tell the truth,\" said Hermione. \"Very good, very good!\" said Slughorn happily. \"Now,\" he continued, pointing at the cauldron nearest the Ravenclaw table, \"this one here is pretty well known... Featured in a few Ministry leaflets lately too... Who can - ?\" Hermione's hand was fastest once more. \"lt's Polyjuice Potion, sir,\" she said. Harry too had recognized the slow-bubbling, mudlike substance the second cauldron, but did not resent Hermione getting the credit for answering the question; she, after all, was the one who had succeeded in making it, back in their second year. \"Excellent, excellent! Now, this one here . . . yes, my dear?\" said Slughorn, now looking slightly bemused, as Hermione's hand punched the air again. \"It's Amortentia!\" \"It is indeed. Ir seems almost foolish to ask,\" said Slughorn, who was looking mightily impressed, \"but I assume you know what it does?\" \"It's the most powerful love porion in the world!\" said Hermione. \"Quite right! You recognized it, I suppose, by its distinctive mother-of-pearl sheen?\" \"And the steam rising in characteristic spirals,\" said Hermione enthusiastically, \"and it's supposed to smell differently to each of according to what attracts us, and I can smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and -\" But she turned slightly pink and did not complete the sentence. 'May I ask your name, my dear?\" said Slughorn, ignoring Hermione's embarrassment. \"Hermione Granger, sir.\" \"Granger? Granger? Can you possibly be related to Hector Dagworth-Granger, who founded the Most Extraordinary Society of Potioneers?\" \"No. I don't think so, sir. I'm Muggle-born, you see.\" Harry saw Malfoy lean close to Nott and whisper something; both of them sniggered, but Slughorn showed no dismay; on the contrary, he beamed and looked from Hermione to Harry, who was sitting next to her. \"Oho! ‘One of my best friends is Muggle-born, and she's the best in our year!' I'm assuming this is the very friend of whom you spoke, Harry?\" \"Yes, sir,\" said Harry. \"Well, well, take twenty well-earned points for Gryffindor, Miss Granger,\" said Slughorn genially. Malfoy looked rather as he had done the time Hermione had punched him in the face. Hermione turned to Harry with a radiant expression and whispered, \"Did you really tell him I'm the best in the year? Oh, Harry!\" \"Well, what's so impressive about that?\" whispered Ron, who for some reason looked annoyed. \"You are the best in the year - I'd've told him so if he'd asked me!\" Hermione smiled but made a \"shhing\" gesture, so that they could hear what Slughorn was saying. Ron looked slightly disgruntled. \"Amortentia doesn't really create love, of course. It is impossible to manufacture or imitate love. No, this will simply cause a powerful infatuation or obsession. It is probably the most dangerous and powerful potion in this room - oh yes,\" he said, nodding gravely at Malfoy and Nott, both of whom were smirking skeptically. \"When you have seen as much of life as I have, you will not underestimate the power of obsessive love.\" \"And now,\" said Slughorn, \"it is time for us to start work.\" \"Sir, you haven't told us what's in this one,\" said Ernie Macmillan, pointing at a small black cauldron standing on Slughorn's desk. The potion within was splashing about merrily; it was the color of molten gold, and large drops were leaping like goldfish above the surface, though not a particle had spilled. \"Oho,\" said Slughorn again. Harry was sure that Slughorn had not forgotten the potion at all, but had waited to be asked for dramatic effect. \"Yes. That. Well, that one, ladies and gentlemen, is a most curious little potion called Felix Felicis. I take it,\" he turned, smiling, to look at Hermione, who had let out an audible gasp, \"that you know what Felix Felicis does, Miss Granger?\" \"It's liquid luck,\" said Hermione excitedly. \"It makes you lucky!\" The whole class seemed to sit up a little straighter. Now all Harry could see of Malfoy was the back of his sleek blond head, because he was at last giving Slughorn his full and undivided attention. \"Quite right, take another ten points for Gryffindor. Yes, it's a funny little potion, Felix Felicis,\" said Slughorn. \"Desperately tricky to make, and disastrous to get wrong. However, if brewed correctly, as this has been, you will find that all your endeavors tend to succeed ... at least until the effects wear off.\" \"Why don't people drink it all the time, sir?\" said Terry Boot eagerly. \"Because if taken in excess, it causes giddiness, recklessness, and dangerous overconfidence,\" said Slughorn. \"Too much of a good thing, you know. . . highly toxic in large quantities. But taken sparingly, and very occasionally . . .\" \"Have you ever taken it, sir?\" asked Michael Corner with great interest. \"Twice in my life,\" said Slughorn. \"Once when I was twenty-four, once when I was fifty-seven. Two tablespoonfuls taken with breakfast. Two perfect days.\" He gazed dreamily into the distance. Whether he was playacting or not, thought Harry, the effect was good. \"And that,\" said Slughorn, apparently coming back to earth, \"is what I shall be offering as a prize in this lesson.\" There was silence in which every bubble and gurgle of the surrounding potions seemed magnified tenfold. \"One tiny bottle of Felix Felicis,\" said Slughorn, taking a minuscule glass bottle with a cork in it out of his pocket and showing it to them all. \"Enough for twelve hours' luck. From dawn till dusk, you will be lucky in everything you attempt.\" \"Now, I must give you warning that Felix Felicis is a banned substance in organized competitions . . . sporting events, for instance, examinations, or elections. So the winner is to use it on an ordinary day only . . . and watch how that ordinary day becomes extraordinary!\" \"So,\" said Slughorn, suddenly brisk, \"how are you to win this fabulous prize? Well, by turning to page ten of Advanced Potion Making. We have a little over an hour left to us, which should be time for you to make a decent attempt at the Draught of Living Death. I know it is more complex than anything you have attempted before, and I do not expect a perfect potion from anybody. The person who does best, however, will win little Felix here. Off you go!\" There was a scraping as everyone drew their cauldrons toward them and some loud clunks as people began adding weights to their scales, but nobody spoke. The concentration within the room was almost tangible. Harry saw Malfoy riffling feverishly through his copy of Advanced Potion-Making., It could not have been clearer that Malfoy really wanted that lucky day. Harry bent swiftly over the tattered book Slughorn had lent him. To his annoyance he saw that the previous owner had scribbled all over the pages, so that the margins were as black as the printed portions. Bending low to decipher the ingredients (even here, the previous owner had made annotations and crossed things out) Harry hurried off toward the store cupboard to find what he needed. As he dashed back to his cauldron, he saw Malfoy cutting up Valerian roots as fast as he could. Everyone kept glancing around at what the rest of the class was doing; this was both an advantage and a disadvantage of Potions, that it was hard to keep your work private. Within ten minutes, the whole place was full of bluish steam. Hermione, of course, seemed to have progressed furthest. Her potion already resembled the \"smooth, black currant-colored liquid\" mentioned as the ideal halfway stage. Having finished chopping his roots, Harry bent low over his book again. It was really very irritating, having to try and decipher the directions under all the stupid scribbles of the previous owner, who for some reason had taken issue with the order to cut up the sopophorous bean and had written in the alternative instruction: Crush with flat side of silver dagger, releases juice better than cutting. \"Sir, I think you knew my grandfather, Abraxas Malfoy?\" Harry looked up; Slughorn was just passing the Slytherin table. \"Yes,\" said Slughorn, without looking at Malfoy, \"I was sorry to hear he had died, although of course it wasn't unexpected, dragon pox at his age...\" And he walked away. Harry bent back over his cauldron, smirking. He could tell that Malfoy had expected to be treated like Harry or Zabini; perhaps even hoped for some preferential treatment of the type he had learned to expect from Snape. It looked as though Malfoy would have to rely on nothing but talent to win the bottle of Felix Felicis. The sopophorous bean was proving very difficult to cut up. Harry turned to Hermione. \"Can I borrow your silver knife?\" She nodded impatiently, not taking her eyes off her potion, which was still deep purple, though according to the book ought to be turning a light shade of lilac by now. Harry crushed his bean with the flat side of the dagger. To his astonishment, it immediately exuded so much juice he was amazed the shriveled bean could have held it all. Hastily scooping it all into the cauldron he saw, to his surprise, that the potion immediately turned exactly the shade of lilac described by the textbook. His annoyance with the previous owner vanishing on the spot, Harry now squinted at the next line of instructions. According the book, he had to stir counterclockwise until the potion turned clear as water. According to the addition the previous owner made, however, he ought to add a clockwise stir after every seventh counterclockwise stir. Could the old owner be right twice? Harry stirred counterclockwise, held his breath, and stirred once clockwise. The effect was immediate. The potion turned pale pink. \"How are you doing that?\" demanded Hermione, who was redfaced and whose hair was growing bushier and bushier in the fumes from her cauldron; her potion was still resolutely purple. \"Add a clockwise stir -\" \"No, no, the book says counterclockwise!\" she snapped. Harry shrugged and continued what he was doing. Seven stirs counterdockwise, one clockwise, pause . . . seven stirs counterclockwise, one stir clockwise . . . Across the table, Ron was cursing fluently under his breath; his potion looked like liquid licorice. Harry glanced around. As far as he could see, no one else's potion had turned as pale as his. He felt elated, something that had certainly never happened before in this dungeon. \"And time's . . . up!\" called Slughorn. \"Stop stirring, please!\" Slughorn moved slowly among the tables, peering into cauldrons. He made no comment, but occasionally gave the potions a stir or a sniff. At last he reached the table where Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ernie were sitting. He smiled ruefully at the tarlike substance in Ron's cauldron. He passed over Ernie's navy concoction. Hermione's potion he gave an approving nod. Then he saw Harry's, and a look of incredulous delight spread over his face. \"The clear winner!\" he cried to the dungeon. \"Excellent, excellent, Harry! Good lord, it's clear you've inherited your mother's talent. She was a dab hand at Potions, Lily was! Here you are, then, here you are - one bottle of Felix Felicis, as promised, and use it well!\" Harry slipped the tiny bottle of golden liquid into his inner pocket, feeling an odd combination of delight at the furious looks on the Slytherins' faces and guilt at the disappointed expression on Hermione's. Ron looked simply dumbfounded. \"How did you do that?\" he whispered to Harry as they left the dungeon. \"Got lucky, I suppose,\" said Harry, because Malfoy was within earshot. Once they were securely ensconced at the Gryffindor table for dinner, however, he felt safe enough to tell them. Hermione's face became stonier with every word he uttered. \"I s'pose you think I cheated?\" he finished, aggravated by her expression. \"Well, it wasn't exactly your own work, was it?\" she said stiffly. \"He only followed different instructions to ours,\" said Ron, \"Could've been a catastrophe, couldn't it? But he took a risk and it paid off.\" He heaved a sigh. \"Slughorn could've handed me that book, but no, I get the one no one's ever written on. Puked on, by the look of page fifty-two, but-\" \"Hang on,\" said a voice close by Harry's left ear and he caught a sudden waft of that flowery smell he had picked up in Slughorn's dungeon. He looked around and saw that Ginny had joined them. \"Did I hear right? You've been taking orders from something someone wrote in a book, Harry?\" She looked alarmed and angry. Harry knew what was on her mind at once. \"It's nothing,\" he said reassuringly, lowering his voice. \"It's not like, you know, Riddle's diary. It's just an old textbook someone's scribbled on.\" \"But you're doing what it says?\" \"I just tried a few of the tips written in the margins, honestly, Ginny, there's nothing funny -\" \"Ginny's got a point,\" said Hermione, perking up at once. \"We ought to check that there's nothing odd about it. I mean, all these funny instructions, who knows?\" \"Hey!\" said Harry indignantly, as she pulled his copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bag and raised her wand. \"Specialis Revelio!\" she said, rapping it smartly on the front cover. Nothing whatsoever happened. The book simply lay there, looking old and dirty and dog-eared. \"Finished?\" said Harry irritably. \"Or d'you want to wait and see if it does a few backflips?\" \"It seems all right,\" said Hermione, still staring at the book suspiciously. \"I mean, it really does seem to be ... just a textbook.\" \"Good. Then I'll have it back,\" said Harry, snatching it off the table, but it slipped from his hand and landed open on the floor. Nobody else was looking. Harry bent low to retrieve the book, and as he did so, he saw something scribbled along the bottom of the back cover in the same small, cramped handwriting as the instructions that had won him his bottle of Felix Felicis, now safely hidden inside a pair of socks in his trunk upstairs. This book is the property of the Half Blood Prince. \n",

            " TWENTYSEVEN  PADFOOT RETURNS One of the best things about the aftermath of the second task was that everybody was very keen to hear details of what had happened down in the lake, which meant that Ron was getting to share Harry's limelight for once. Harry noticed that Ron's version of events changed subtly with every retelling. At first, he gave what seemed to be the truth; it tallied with Hermione's story, anyway  Dumbledore had put all the hostages into a bewitched sleep in Professor McGonagall's office, first assuring them that they would be quite safe, and would awake when they were back above the water. One week later, however, Ron was telling a thrilling tale of kidnap in which he struggled singlehandedly against fifty heavily armed merpeople who had to beat him into submission before tying him up. \"But I had my wand hidden up my sleeve,\" he assured Padma Patil, who seemed to be a lot keener on Ron now that he was getting so much attention and was making a point of talking to him every time they passed in the corridors. \"I could've taken those meridiots any time I wanted.\" \"What were you going to do, snore at them?\" said Hermione waspishly. People had been teasing her so much about being the thing that Viktor Krum would most miss that she was in a rather tetchy mood. Ron's ears went red, and thereafter, he reverted to the bewitched sleep version of events. As they entered March the weather became drier, but cruel winds skinned their hands and faces every time they went out onto the grounds. There were delays in the post because the owls kept being blown off course. The brown owl that Harry had sent to Sirius with the dates of the Hogsmeade weekend turned up at breakfast on Friday morning with half its feathers sticking up the wrong way; Harry had no sooner torn off Sirius's reply than it took flight, clearly afraid it was going to be sent outside again. Sirius's letter was almost as short as the previous one. Be at stile at end of road out of Hogsmeade (past Dervish and Banges) at two o'clock on Saturday afternoon. Bring as much food as you can. \"He hasn't come back to Hogsmeade?\" said Ron incredulously. \"It looks like it, doesn't it?\" said Hermione. \"I can't believe him,\" said Harry tensely, \"if he's caught. . .\" \"Made it so far, though, hasn't he?\" said Ron. \"And it's not like the place is swarming with dementors anymore.\" Harry folded up the letter, thinking. If he was honest with himself, he really wanted to see Sirius again. He therefore approached the final lesson of the afternoon  double Potions  feeling considerably more cheerful than he usually did when descending the steps to the dungeons. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were standing in a huddle outside the classroom door with Pansy Parkinson's gang of Slytherin girls. All of them were looking at something Harry couldn't see and sniggering heartily. Pansys puglike face peered excitedly around Goyle's broad back as Harry, Ron, and Hermione approached. \"There they are, there they are!\" she giggled, and the knot of Slytherins broke apart. Harry saw that Pansy had a magazine in her hands  Witch Weekly. The moving picture on the front showed a curlyhaired witch who was smiling toothily and pointing at a large sponge cake with her wand. \"You might find something to interest you in there, Granger!\" Pansy said loudly, and she threw the magazine at Hermione, who caught it, looking startled. At that moment, the dungeon door opened, and Snape beckoned them all inside. Hermione, Harry, and Ron headed for a table at the back of the dungeon as usual. Once Snape had turned his back on them to write up the ingredients of todays potion on the blackboard, Hermione hastily rifled through the magazine under the desk. At last, in the center pages, Hermione found what they were looking for. Harry and Ron leaned in closer. A color photograph of Harry headed a short piece entitled: Harry Potter's Secret Heartache A boy like no other, perhaps  yet a boy suffering all the usual pangs of adolescence, writes Rita Skeeter. Deprived of love since the tragic demise of his parents, fourteenyearold Harry Potter thought he had found solace in his steady girlfriend at Hogwarts, Muggleborn Hermione Granger. Little did he know that he would shortly be suffering yet another emotional blow in a life already littered with personal loss. Miss Granger, a plain but ambitious girl, seems to have a taste for famous wizards that Harry alone cannot satisfy. Since the arrival at Hogwarts of Viktor Krum, Bulgarian Seeker and hero of the last World Quidditch Cup, Miss Granger has been toying with both boys' affections. Krum, who is openly smitten with the devious Miss Granger, has already invited her to visit him in Bulgaria over the summer holidays, and insists that he has \"never felt this way about any other girl.\" However, it might not be Miss Granger's doubtful natural charms that have captured these unfortunate boys' interest. \"She's really ugly,\" says Pansy Parkinson, a pretty and vivacious fourthyear student, \"but she'd be well up to making a Love Potion, she's quite brainy. I think that's how she's doing it.\" Love Potions are, of course, banned at Hogwarts, and no doubt Albus Dumbledore will want to investigate these claims. In the meantime, Harry Potters wellwishers must hope that, next time, he bestows his heart on a worthier candidate. \"I told you!\" Ron hissed at Hermione as she stared down at the article. \"I told you not to annoy Rita Skeeter! She's made you out to be some sort of of scarlet woman!\" Hermione stopped looking astonished and snorted with laughter. \"Scarlet woman?\" she repeated, shaking with suppressed giggles as she looked around at Ron. \"It's what my mum calls them,\" Ron muttered, his ears going red. \"If that's the best Rita can do, she's losing her touch,\" said Hermione, still giggling, as she threw Witch Weekly onto the empty chair beside her. \"What a pile of old rubbish.\" She looked over at the Slytherins, who were all watching her and Harry closely across the room to see if they had been upset by the article. Hermione gave them a sarcastic smile and a wave, and she, Harry, and Ron started unpacking the ingredients they would need for their WitSharpening Potion. \"There's something funny, though,\" said Hermione ten minutes later, holding her pestle suspended over a bowl of scarab beetles. \"How could Rita Skeeter have known . . . ?\" \"Known what?\" said Ron quickly. \"You haven't been mixing up Love Potions, have you?\" \"Don't be stupid,\" Hermione snapped, starting to pound up her beetles again. \"No, it's just. . . how did she know Viktor asked me to visit him over the summer?\" Hermione blushed scarlet as she said this and determinedly avoided Ron's eyes. \"What?\" said Ron, dropping his pestle with a loud clunk. \"He asked me right after he'd pulled me out of the lake,\" Hermione muttered. \"After he'd got rid of his shark's head. Madam Pomfrey gave us both blankets and then he sort of pulled me away from the judges so they wouldn't hear, and he said, if I wasn't doing anything over the summer, would I like to \" \"And what did you say?\" said Ron, who had picked up his pestle and was grinding it on the desk, a good six inches from his bowl, because he was looking at Hermione. \"And he did say he'd never felt the same way about anyone else,\" Hermione went on, going so red now that Harry could almost feel the heat coming from her, \"but how could Rita Skeeter have heard him? She wasn't there ... or was she? Maybe she has got an Invisibility Cloak; maybe she sneaked onto the grounds to watch the second task. ...\" \"And what did you say?\" Ron repeated, pounding his pestle down so hard that it dented the desk. \"Well, I was too busy seeing whether you and Harry were okay to\" \"Fascinating though your social life undoubtedly is. Miss Granger,\" said an icy voice right behind them, and all three of them jumped, \"I must ask you not to discuss it in my class. Ten points from Gryffindor.\" Snape had glided over to their desk while they were talking. The whole class was now looking around at them; Malfoy took the opportunity to flash POTTER STINKS across the dungeon at Harry. \"Ah . . . reading magazines under the table as well?\" Snape added, snatching up the copy of Witch Weekly. \"A further ten points from Gryffindor ... oh but of course ...\" Snapes black eyes glittered as they fell on Rita Skeeter's article. \"Potter has to keep up with his press cuttings. . . .\" The dungeon rang with the Slytherins' laughter, and an unpleasant smile curled Snape's thin mouth. To Harry's fury, he began to read the article aloud. \"'Harry Potter's Secret Heartache. . . dear, dear. Potter, what's ailing you now? 'A boy like no other, perhaps. . .'“ Harry could feel his face burning. Snape was pausing at the end of every sentence to allow the Slytherins a hearty laugh. The article sounded ten times worse when read by Snape. Even Hermione was blushing scarlet now. \"'. . . Harry Potter's wellwishers must hope that, next time, he bestows his heart upon a worthier candidate.' How very touching,\" sneered Snape, rolling up the magazine to continued gales of laughter from the Slytherins. \"Well, I think I had better separate the three of you, so you can keep your minds on your potions rather than on your tangled love lives. Weasley, you stay here. Miss Granger, over there, beside Miss Parkinson. Potter  that table in front of my desk. Move. Now.\" Furious, Harry threw his ingredients and his bag into his cauldron and dragged it up to the front of the dungeon to the empty table. Snape followed, sat down at his desk and watched Harry unload his cauldron. Determined not to look at Snape, Harry resumed the mashing of his scarab beetles, imagining each one to have Snape's face. \"All this press attention seems to have inflated your already overlarge head. Potter,\" said Snape quietly, once the rest of the class had settled down again. Harry didn't answer. He knew Snape was trying to provoke him; he had done this before. No doubt he was hoping for an excuse to take a round fifty points from Gryffindor before the end of the class. \"You might be laboring under the delusion that the entire wizarding world is impressed with you,\" Snape went on, so quietly that no one else could hear him (Harry continued to pound his scarab beetles, even though he had already reduced them to a very fine powder), \"but I don't care how many times your picture appears in the papers. To me. Potter, you are nothing but a nasty little boy who considers rules to be beneath him.\" Harry tipped the powdered beetles into his cauldron and started cutting up his ginger roots. His hands were shaking slightly out of anger, but he kept his eyes down, as though he couldn't hear what Snape was saying to him. \"So I give you fair warning, Potter,\" Snape continued in a sorter and more dangerous voice, \"pintsized celebrity or not  if I catch you breaking into my office one more time \" \"I haven't been anywhere near your office!\" said Harry angrily, forgetting his feigned deafness. \"Don't lie to me,\" Snape hissed, his fathomless black eyes boring into Harrys. \"Boomslang skin. Gillyweed. Both come from my private stores, and I know who stole them.\" Harry stared back at Snape, determined not to blink or to look guilty. In truth, he hadn't stolen either of these things from Snape. Hermione had taken the boomslang skin back in their second year  they had needed it for the Polyjuice Potion  and while Snape had suspected Harry at the time, he had never been able to prove it. Dobby, of course, had stolen the gillyweed. \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" Harry lied coldly. \"You were out of bed on the night my office was broken into!\" Snape hissed. \"I know it. Potter! Now, MadEye Moody might have joined your fan club, but I will not tolerate your behavior! One more nighttime stroll into my office, Potter, and you will pay!\" \"Right,\" said Harry coolly, turning back to his ginger roots. \"I'll bear that in mind if I ever get the urge to go in there.\" Snape's eyes flashed. He plunged a hand into the inside of his black robes. For one wild moment. Harry thought Snape was about to pull out his wand and curse him  then he saw that Snape had drawn out a small crystal bottle of a completely clear potion. Harry stared at it. \"Do you know what this is. Potter?\" Snape said, his eyes glittering dangerously again. \"No,\" said Harry, with complete honesty this time. \"It is Veritaserum  a Truth Potion so powerful that three drops would have you spilling your innermost secrets for this entire class to hear,\" said Snape viciously. \"Now, the use of this potion is controlled by very strict Ministry guidelines. But unless you watch your step, you might just find that my hand slips\"  he shook the crystal bottle slightly  \"right over your evening pumpkin juice. And then. Potter . . . then we'll find out whether you've been in my office or not.\" Harry said nothing. He turned back to his ginger roots once more, picked up his knife, and started slicing them again. He didn't like the sound of that Truth Potion at all, nor would he put it past Snape to slip him some. He repressed a shudder at the thought of what might come spilling out of his mouth if Snape did it... quite apart from landing a whole lot of people in trouble  Hermione and Dobby for a start  there were all the other things he was concealing . . . like the fact that he was in contact with Sirius . . . and  his insides squirmed at the thought  how he felt about Cho. ... He tipped his ginger roots into the cauldron too, and wondered whether he ought to take a leaf out of Moody s book and start drinking only from a private hip flask. There was a knock on the dungeon door. \"Enter,\" said Snape in his usual voice. The class looked around as the door opened. Professor Karkaroff came in. Everyone watched him as he walked up toward Snape's desk. He was twisting his finger around his goatee and looking agitated. \"We need to talk,\" said Karkaroff abruptly when he had reached Snape. He seemed so determined that nobody should hear what he was saying that he was barely opening his lips; it was as though he were a rather poor ventriloquist. Harry kept his eyes on his ginger roots, listening hard. \"I'll talk to you after my lesson, Karkaroff,\" Snape muttered, but Karkaroff interrupted him. \"I want to talk now, while you can't slip off, Severus. You've been avoiding me.\" \"After the lesson,\" Snape snapped. Under the pretext of holding up a measuring cup to see if he'd poured out enough armadillo bile, Harry sneaked a sidelong glance at the pair of them. Karkaroff looked extremely worried, and Snape looked angry. Karkaroff hovered behind Snape's desk for the rest of the double period. He seemed intent on preventing Snape from slipping away at the end of class. Keen to hear what Karkaroff wanted to say, Harry deliberately knocked over his bottle of armadillo bile with two minutes to go to the bell, which gave him an excuse to duck down behind his cauldron and mop up while the rest of the class moved noisily toward the door. \"What's so urgent?\" he heard Snape hiss at Karkaroff. \"This,\" said Karkaroff, and Harry, peering around the edge of his cauldron, saw Karkaroff pull up the lefthand sleeve of his robe and show Snape something on his inner forearm. \"Well?\" said Karkaroff, still making every effort not to move his lips. \"Do you see? It's never been this clear, never since  \" \"Put it away!\" snarled Snape, his black eyes sweeping the classroom. \"But you must have noticed \" Karkaroff began in an agitated voice. \"We can talk later, Karkaroff!\" spat Snape. \"Potter! What are you doing?\" \"Clearing up my armadillo bile, Professor,\" said Harry innocently, straightening up and showing Snape the sodden rag he was holding. Karkaroff turned on his heel and strode out of the dungeon. He looked both worried and angry. Not wanting to remain alone with an exceptionally angry Snape, Harry threw his books and ingredients back into his bag and left at top speed to tell Ron and Hermione what he had just witnessed. They left the castle at noon the next day to find a weak silver sun shining down upon the grounds. The weather was milder than it had been all year, and by the time they arrived in Hogsmeade, all three of them had taken off their cloaks and thrown them over their shoulders. The food Sirius had told them to bring was in Harry's bag; they had sneaked a dozen chicken legs, a loaf of bread, and a flask of pumpkin juice from the lunch table. They went into Gladrags Wizardwear to buy a present for Dobby, where they had fun selecting the most lurid socks they could find, including a pair patterned with flashing gold and silver stars, and another that screamed loudly when they became too smelly. Then, at half past one, they made their way up the High Street, past Dervish and Banges, and out toward the edge of the village. Harry had never been in this direction before. The winding lane was leading them out into the wild countryside around Hogsmeade. The cottages were fewer here, and their gardens larger; they were walking toward the foot of the mountain in whose shadow Hogsmeade lay. Then they turned a corner and saw a stile at the end of the lane. Waiting for them, its front paws on the topmost bar, was a very large, shaggy black dog, which was carrying some newspapers in its mouth and looking very familiar. . . . \"Hello, Sirius,\" said Harry when they had reached him. The black dog sniffed Harry's bag eagerly, wagged its tail once, then turned and began to trot away from them across the scrubby patch of ground that rose to meet the rocky foot of the mountain. Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed over the stile and followed. Sirius led them to the very foot of the mountain, where the ground was covered with boulders and rocks. It was easy for him, with his four paws, but Harry, Ron, and Hermione were soon out of breath. They followed Sirius higher, up onto the mountain itself. For nearly half an hour they climbed a steep, winding, and stony path, following Sirius's wagging tail, sweating in the sun, the shoulder straps of Harry's bag cutting into his shoulders. Then, at last, Sirius slipped out of sight, and when they reached the place where he had vanished, they saw a narrow fissure in the rock. They squeezed into it and found themselves in a cool, dimly lit cave. Tethered at the end of it, one end of his rope around a large rock, was Buckbeak the hippogriff. Half gray horse, half giant eagle, Buckbeak's fierce orange eye flashed at the sight of them. All three of them bowed low to him, and after regarding them imperiously for a moment, Buckbeak bent his scaly front knees and allowed Hermione to rush forward and stroke his feathery neck. Harry, however, was looking at the black dog, which had just turned into his godfather. Sirius was wearing ragged gray robes; the same ones he had been wearing when he had left Azkaban. His black hair was longer than it had been when he had appeared in the fire, and it was untidy and matted once more. He looked very thin. \"Chicken!\" he said hoarsely after removing the old Daily Prophets from his mouth and throwing them down onto the cave floor. Harry pulled open his bag and handed over the bundle of chicken legs and bread. \"Thanks,\" said Sirius, opening it, grabbing a drumstick, sitting down on the cave floor, and tearing off a large chunk with his teeth. \"I've been living off rats mostly. Can't steal too much food from Hogsmeade; I'd draw attention to myself.\" He grinned up at Harry, but Harry returned the grin only reluctantly. \"What're you doing here, Sirius?\" he said. \"Fulfilling my duty as godfather,\" said Sirius, gnawing on the chicken bone in a very doglike way. \"Don't worry about it, I'm pretending to be a lovable stray.\" He was still grinning, but seeing the anxiety in Harrys face, said more seriously, \"I want to be on the spot. Your last letter . . . well, let's just say things are getting fishier. I've been stealing the paper every time someone throws one out, and by the looks of things, I'm not the only one who's getting worried.\" He nodded at the yellowing Daily Prophets on the cave floor, and Ron picked them up and unfolded them. Harry, however, continued to stare at Sirius. \"What if they catch you? What if you're seen?\" \"You three and Dumbledore are the only ones around here who know I'm an Animagus,\" said Sirius, shrugging, and continuing to devour the chicken leg. Ron nudged Harry and passed him the Daily Prophets. There were two: The first bore the headline Mystery Illness ofBartemius Crouch, the second, Ministry Witch Still MissingMinister of Magic Now Personally Involved. Harry scanned the story about Crouch. Phrases jumped out at him: hasn't been seen in public since November. . . house appears deserted. . . St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries decline comment. . . Ministry refuses to confirm rumors of critical illness. . . . \"They're making it sound like he's dying,\" said Harry slowly. \"But he can't be that ill if he managed to get up here. . . .\" \"My brothers Crouch's personal assistant,\" Ron informed Sirius. \"He says Crouch is suffering from overwork.\" \"Mind you, he did look ill, last time I saw him up close,\" said Harry slowly, still reading the story. \"The night my name came out of the goblet. ...\" \"Getting his comeuppance for sacking Winky, isn't he?\" said Hermione, an edge to her voice. She was stroking Buckbeak, who was crunching up Sirius's chicken bones. \"I bet he wishes he hadn't done it now  bet he feels the difference now she's not there to look after him.\" \"Hermione's obsessed with houseelfs,\" Ron muttered to Sirius, casting Hermione a dark look. Sirius, however, looked interested. \"Crouch sacked his houseelf?\" \"Yeah, at the Quidditch World Cup,\" said Harry, and he launched into the story of the Dark Mark's appearance, and Winky being found with Harrys wand clutched in her hand, and Mr. Crouch's fury. When Harry had finished, Sirius was on his feet again and had started pacing up and down the cave. \"Let me get this straight,\" he said after a while, brandishing a fresh chicken leg. \"You first saw the elfin the Top Box. She was saving Crouch a seat, right?\" \"Right,\" said Harry, Ron, and Hermione together. \"But Crouch didn't turn up for the match?\" \"No,\" said Harry. \"I think he said he'd been too busy.\" Sirius paced all around the cave in silence. Then he said, \"Harry, did you check your pockets for your wand after you'd left the Top Box?\" \"Erm . . .\" Harry thought hard. \"No,\" he said finally. \"I didn't need to use it before we got in the forest. And then I put my hand in my pocket, and all that was in there were my Omnioculars.\" He stared at Sirius. \"Are you saying whoever conjured the Mark stole my wand in the Top Box?\" \"It's possible,\" said Sirius. \"Winky didn't steal that wand!\" Hermione insisted. \"The elf wasn't the only one in that box,\" said Sirius, his brow furrowed as he continued to pace. \"Who else was sitting behind you?\" \"Loads of people,\" said Harry. \"Some Bulgarian ministers .. . Cornelius Fudge ... the Malfoys ...\" \"The Malfoys!\" said Ron suddenly, so loudly that his voice echoed all around the cave, and Buckbeak tossed his head nervously. \"I bet it was Lucius Malfoy!\" \"Anyone else?\" said Sirius. \"No one,\" said Harry. \"Yes, there was, there was Ludo Bagman,\" Hermione reminded him. \"Oh yeah . . .\" \"I don't know anything about Bagman except that he used to be Beater for the Wimbourne Wasps,\" said Sirius, still pacing. \"What's he like?\" \"He's okay,\" said Harry. \"He keeps offering to help me with the Triwizard Tournament.\" \"Does he, now?\" said Sirius, frowning more deeply. \"I wonder why he'd do that?\" \"Says he's taken a liking to me,\" said Harry. \"Hmm,\" said Sirius, looking thoughtful. \"We saw him in the forest just before the Dark Mark appeared,\" Hermione told Sirius. \"Remember?\" she said to Harry and Ron. \"Yeah, but he didn't stay in the forest, did he?\" said Ron. \"The moment we told him about the riot, he went off to the campsite.\" \"How d'you know?\" Hermione shot back. \"How d'you know where he Disapparated to?\" \"Come off it,\" said Ron incredulously. \"Are you saying you reckon Ludo Bagman conjured the Dark Mark?\" \"It's more likely he did it than Winky,\" said Hermione stubbornly. \"Told you,\" said Ron, looking meaningfully at Sirius, \"told you she's obsessed with house \" But Sirius held up a hand to silence Ron. \"When the Dark Mark had been conjured, and the elf had been discovered holding Harry's wand, what did Crouch do?\" \"Went to look in the bushes,\" said Harry, \"but there wasn't anyone else there.\" \"Of course,\" Sirius muttered, pacing up and down, \"of course, he'd want to pin it on anyone but his own elf... and then he sacked her?\" \"Yes,\" said Hermione in a heated voice, \"he sacked her, just because she hadn't stayed in her tent and let herself get trampled \" \"Hermione, will you give it a rest with the elf!\" said Ron. Sirius shook his head and said, \"She's got the measure of Crouch better than you have, Ron. If you want to know what a mans like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.\" He ran a hand over his unshaven face, evidently thinking hard. \"All these absences of Barty Crouch's ... he goes to the trouble of making sure his houseelf saves him a seat at the Quidditch World Cup, but doesn't bother to turn up and watch. He works very hard to reinstate the Triwizard Tournament, and then stops coming to that too. . . . It's not like Crouch. If he's ever taken a day off work because of illness before this, I'll eat Buckbeak.\" \"D'you know Crouch, then?\" said Harry. Sirius's face darkened. He suddenly looked as menacing as he had the night when Harry first met him, the night when Harry still believed Sirius to be a murderer. \"Oh I know Crouch all right,\" he said quietly. \"He was the one who gave the order for me to be sent to Azkaban  without a trial.\" \"What?\" said Ron and Hermione together. \"You're kidding!\" said Harry. \"No, I'm not,\" said Sirius, taking another great bite of chicken. \"Crouch used to be Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, didn't you know?\" Harry, Ron, and Hermione shook their heads. \"He was tipped for the next Minister of Magic,\" said Sirius. \"He's a great wizard, Barty Crouch, powerfully magical  and powerhungry. Oh never a Voldemort supporter,\" he said, reading the look on Harrys face. \"No, Barty Crouch was always very outspoken against the Dark Side. But then a lot of people who were against the Dark Side . . . well, you wouldn't understand . . . you're too young. ...\" \"That's what my dad said at the World Cup,\" said Ron, with a trace of irritation in his voice. \"Try us, why don't you?\" A grin flashed across Sirius's thin face. \"All right, I'll try you. . . .\" He walked once up the cave, back again, and then said, \"Imagine that Voldemort's powerful now. You don't know who his supporters are, you don't know who's working for him and who isn't; you know he can control people so that they do terrible things without being able to stop themselves. You're scared for yourself, and your family, and your friends. Every week, news comes of more deaths, more disappearances, more torturing . . . the Ministry of Magic's in disarray, they don't know what to do, they're trying to keep everything hidden from the Muggles, but meanwhile, Muggles are dying too. Terror everywhere . . . panic . . . confusion . . . that's how it used to be. \"Well, times like that bring out the best in some people and the worst in others. Crouch's principles might've been good in the beginning  I wouldn't know. He rose quickly through the Ministry, and he started ordering very harsh measures against Voldemorts supporters. The Aurors were given new powers  powers to kill rather than capture, for instance. And I wasn't the only one who was handed straight to the dementors without trial. Crouch fought violence with violence, and authorized the use of the Unforgivable Curses against suspects. I would say he became as ruthless and cruel as many on the Dark Side. He had his supporters, mind you  plenty of people thought he was going about things the right way, and there were a lot of witches and wizards clamoring for him to take over as Minister of Magic. When Voldemort disappeared, it looked like only a matter of time until Crouch got the top job. But then something rather unfortunate happened. ...\" Sirius smiled grimly. \"Crouch's own son was caught with a group of Death Eaters who'd managed to talk their way out of Azkaban. Apparently they were trying to find Voldemort and return him to power.\" \"Crouch's son was caught?\" gasped Hermione. \"Yep,\" said Sirius, throwing his chicken bone to Buckbeak, flinging himself back down on the ground beside the loaf of bread, and tearing it in half. \"Nasty little shock for old Barty, I'd imagine. Should have spent a bit more time at home with his family, shouldn't he? Ought to have left the office early once in a while . . . gotten to know his own son.\" He began to wolf down large pieces of bread. \"Was his son a Death Eater?\" said Harry. \"No idea,\" said Sirius, still stuffing down bread. \"I was in Azkaban myself when he was brought in. This is mostly stuff I've found out since I got out. The boy was definitely caught in the company of people I'd bet my life were Death Eaters  but he might have been in the wrong place at the wrong time, just like the houseelf.\" \"Did Crouch try and get his son off?\" Hermione whispered. Sirius let out a laugh that was much more like a bark. \"Crouch let his son off? I thought you had the measure of him, Hermione! Anything that threatened to tarnish his reputation had to go; he had dedicated his whole life to becoming Minister of Magic. You saw him dismiss a devoted house elf because she associated him with the Dark Mark again  doesn't that tell you what he's like? Crouch's fatherly affection stretched just far enough to give his son a trial, and by all accounts, it wasn't much more than an excuse for Crouch to show how much he hated the boy . . . then he sent him straight to Azkaban.\" \"He gave his own son to the dementors?\" asked Harry quietly. \"That's right,\" said Sirius, and he didn't look remotely amused now. \"I saw the dementors bringing him in, watched them through the bars in my cell door. He can't have been more than nineteen. They took him into a cell near mine. He was screaming for his mother by nightfall. He went quiet after a few days, though . . .they all went quiet in the end. . . except when they shrieked in their sleep. ...\" For a moment, the deadened look in Sirius's eyes became more pronounced than ever, as though shutters had closed behind them. \"So he's still in Azkaban?\" Harry said. \"No,\" said Sirius dully. \"No, he's not in there anymore. He died about a year after they brought him in.\" \"He died?\" \"He wasn't the only one,\" said Sirius bitterly. \"Most go mad in there, and plenty stop eating in the end. They lose the will to live. You could always tell when a death was coming, because the dementors could sense it, they got excited. That boy looked pretty sickly when he arrived. Crouch being an important Ministry member, he and his wife were allowed a deathbed visit. That was the last time I saw Barty Crouch, half carrying his wife past my cell. She died herself, apparently, shortly afterward. Grief. Wasted away just like the boy. Crouch never came for his sons body. The dementors buried him outside the fortress; I watched them do it.\" Sirius threw aside the bread he had just lifted to his mouth and instead picked up the flask of pumpkin juice and drained it. \"So old Crouch lost it all, just when he thought he had it made,\" he continued, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. \"One moment, a hero, poised to become Minister of Magic...next, his son dead, his wife dead, the family name dishonored, and, so I've heard since I escaped, a big drop in popularity. Once the boy had died, people started feeling a bit more sympathetic toward the son and started asking how a nice young lad from a good family had gone so badly astray. The conclusion was that his father never cared much for him. So Cornelius Fudge got the top job, and Crouch was shunted sideways into the Department of International Magical Cooperation.\" There was a long silence. Harry was thinking of the way Crouch's eyes had bulged as he'd looked down at his disobedient houseelf back in the wood at the Quidditch World Cup. This, then, must have been why Crouch had overreacted to Winky being found beneath the Dark Mark. It had brought back memories of his son, and the old scandal, and his fall from grace at the Ministry. \"Moody says Crouch is obsessed with catching Dark wizards,\" Harry told Sirius. \"Yeah, I've heard it's become a bit of a mania with him,\" said Sirius, nodding. \"If you ask me, he still thinks he can bring back the old popularity by catching one more Death Eater.\" \"And he sneaked up here to search Snape's office!\" s aid Ron triumphantly, looking at Hermione. \"Yes, and that doesn't make sense at all,\" said Sirius. \"Yeah, it does!\" said Ron excitedly, but Sirius shook his head. \"Listen, if Crouch wants to investigate Snape, why hasn't he been coming to judge the tournament? It would be an ideal excuse to make regular visits to Hogwarts and keep an eye on him.\" \"So you think Snape could be up to something, then?\" asked Harry, but Hermione broke in. \"Look, I don't care what you say, Dumbledore trusts Snape \" \"Oh give it a rest, Hermione,\" said Ron impatiently. \"I know Dumbledores brilliant and everything, but that doesn't mean a really clever Dark wizard couldn't fool him \" \"Why did Snape save Harry's life in the first year, then? Why didn't he just let him die?\" \"I dunno  maybe he thought Dumbledore would kick him out\" \"What d'you think, Sirius?\" Harry said loudly, and Ron and Hermione stopped bickering to listen. \"I think they've both got a point,\" said Sirius, looking thoughtfully at Ron and Hermione. \"Ever since I found out Snape was teaching here, I've wondered why Dumbledore hired him. Snape's always been fascinated by the Dark Arts, he was famous for it at school. Slimy, oily, greasyhaired kid, he was,\" Sirius added, and Harry and Ron grinned at each other. \"Snape knew more curses when he arrived at school than half the kids in seventh year, and he was part of a gang of Slytherins who nearly all turned out to be Death Eaters.\" Sirius held up his fingers and began ticking off names. \"Rosier and Wilkes  they were both killed by Aurors the year before Voldemort fell. The Lestranges  they're a married couple  they're in Azkaban. Avery  from what I've heard he wormed his way out of trouble by saying he'd been acting under the Imperius Curse  he's still at large. But as far as I know, Snape was never even accused of being a Death Eater  not that that means much. Plenty of them were never caught. And Snape s certainly clever and cunning enough to keep himself out of trouble.\" \"Snape knows Karkaroff pretty well, but he wants to keep that quiet,\" said Ron. \"Yeah, you should've seen Snape's face when Karkaroff turned up in Potions yesterday!\" said Harry quickly. \"Karkaroff wanted to talk to Snape, he says Snape's been avoiding him. Karkaroff looked really worried. He showed Snape something on his arm, but I couldn't see what it was.\" He showed Snape something on his arm?\" said Sirius, looking frankly bewildered. He ran his fingers distractedly through his filthy hair, then shrugged again. \"Well, I've no idea what that's about. . . but if Karkaroff s genuinely worried, and he's going to Snape for answers ...\" Sirius stared at the cave wall, then made a grimace of frustration. \"There's still the fact that Dumbledore trusts Snape, and I know Dumbledore trusts where a lot of other people wouldn't, but I just can't see him letting Snape teach at Hogwarts if he'd ever worked for Voldemort.\" \"Why are Moody and Crouch so keen to get into Snapes office then?\" said Ron stubbornly. \"Well,\" said Sirius slowly, \"I wouldn't put it past MadEye to have searched every single teacher's office when he got to Hogwarts. He takes his Defense Against the Dark Arts seriously, Moody. I'm not sure he trusts anyone at all, and after the things he's seen, it's not surprising. I'll say this for Moody, though, he never killed if he could help it. Always brought people in alive where possible. He was tough, but he never descended to the level of the Death Eaters. Crouch, though . . . he's a different matter ... is he really ill? If he is, why did he make the effort to drag himself up to Snape's office? And if he's not. . . what's he up to? What was he doing at the World Cup that was so important he didn't turn up in the Top Box! What's he been doing while he should have been judging the tournament?\" Sirius lapsed into silence, still staring at the cave wall. Buckbeak was ferreting around on the rocky floor, looking for bones he might have overlooked. Finally, Sirius looked up at Ron. \"You say your brother s Crouch's personal assistant? Any chance you could ask him if he's seen Crouch lately?\" \"I can try,\" said Ron doubtfully. \"Better not make it sound like I reckon Crouch is up to anything dodgy, though. Percy loves Crouch.\" \"And you might try and find out whether they've got any leads on Bertha Jorkins while you're at it,\" said Sirius, gesturing to the second copy of the Daily Prophet. \"Bagman told me they hadn't,\" said Harry. \"Yes, he's quoted in the article in there,\" said Sirius, nodding at the paper. \"Blustering on about how bad Bertha's memory is. Well, maybe she's changed since I knew her, but the Bertha I knew wasn't forgetful at all  quite the reverse. She was a bit dim, but she had an excellent memory for gossip. It used to get her into a lot of trouble; she never knew when to keep her mouth shut. I can see her being a bit of a liability at the Ministry of Magic . . . maybe that's why Bagman didn't bother to look for her for so long. ...\" Sirius heaved an enormous sigh and rubbed his shadowed eyes. \"What's the time?\" Harry checked his watch, then remembered it hadn't been working since it had spent over an hour in the lake. \"It's half past three,\" said Hermione. \"You'd better get back to school,\" Sirius said, getting to his feet. \"Now listen . . .\" He looked particularly hard at Harry. \"I don't want you lot sneaking out of school to see me, all right? Just send notes to me here. I still want to hear about anything odd. But you're not to go leaving Hogwarts without permission; it would be an ideal opportunity for someone to attack you.\" \"No one's tried to attack me so far, except a dragon and a couple of grindylows,\" Harry said, but Sirius scowled at him. \"I don't care . . . I'll breathe freely again when this tournament's over, and that's not until June. And don't forget, if you're talking about me among yourselves, call me Snuffles, okay?\" He handed Harry the empty napkin and flask and went to pat Buckbeak goodbye. \"I'll walk to the edge of the village with you,\" said Sirius, \"see if I can scrounge another paper.\" He transformed into the great black dog before they left the cave, and they walked back down the mountainside with him, across the boulderstrewn ground, and back to the stile. Here he allowed each of them to pat him on the head, before turning and setting off at a run around the outskirts of the village. Harry, Ron, and Hermione made their way back into Hogsmeade and up toward Hogwarts. \"Wonder if Percy knows all that stuff about Crouch?\" Ron said as they walked up the drive to the castle. \"But maybe he doesn't care . . . It'd probably just make him admire Crouch even more. Yeah, Percy loves rules. He'd just say Crouch was refusing to break them for his own son.\" \"Percy would never throw any of his family to the dementors,\" said Hermione severely. \"I don't know,\" said Ron. \"If he thought we were standing in the way of his career .. . Percy's really ambitious, you know. ...\" They walked up the stone steps into the entrance hall, where the delicious smells of dinner wafted toward them from the Great Hall. \"Poor old Snuffles,\" said Ron, breathing deeply. \"He must really like you. Harry. . . . Imagine having to live off rats.\" \n",

            "-Six The Flaw in the Plan He was flying facedown on the grond again. The smell of the forest filled his nostrils. He could feel the cold hard ground beneath his cheek, and the hinge of his glasses which have been knocked sideways by the fall cutting into his temple. Every inch of him ached, and the place where Killing Curse had hit him felt like the bruise of an iron-clad punch. He did not stir, but he remained exactly where he had fallen, with his left arm bent out at an akward angle and his mouth gaping. He had expected to hear cheer of triumph and jubilation at his death, but instead hurried footsteps, whispers, and solicitous murmurs filled the air. \"My Lord... my Lord...\" It was Bellatrix's voice, and she spoke as if to a lover. Harry did not dare open his eyes, but allowed his other senses to explore his predicament. He knew that his wand was still stowed beneath his robes because he could feel it pressed between his chest and the ground. A slight cushioning effect in the area of his stomach told him that the Invisibility Cloak was also there, stuffed out of sight. \"My Lord...\" \"That will do,\" said Voldemort's voice. More footsteps. Several people were backing away from the same spot. Desperate to see what was happening and why, Harry opened his eyes by a milimeter. Voldemort seemed to be getting to his feet. Various Death Eaters were hurrying away from him, returning to the crowd lining the clearing. Bellatrix alone remained behind, kneeling beside Voldemort. Harry closed his eyes again and considered what he had seen. The Death Eaters have been buddled around Voldemort, who seem to have fallen to the ground. Something had happened when he had hit Harry with the Killing Curse. Had Voldemort too collapsed? It seemed like it. And both of them had briefly fallen unconcious and both of them had now returned. . . \"My Lord, let me --\" \"I do not require assitance,\" said Voldemort coldly, and though he could not see it, Harry pictured Bellatrix withdrawing a helpful hand. \"The boy . . . Is he dead?\" There was a complete silence in the clearing. Nobody approached Harry, but he felt their concentraded gaze; it seemed to press him harder into the ground, and he was terrified a finger or an eyelid might twitch. \"You,\" said Voldemort, and there was a bang and a small shrick of pain. \"Examine him. Tell me whether he is dead.\" Harry did not know who had been sent to verify. He could only lie there, with his heart thumping traitorously, and wait to be examined, but at the same time nothing, small comfort through it was, that Voldemort was wary of approaching him, that Voldemort suspected that all had not gone to plan . . . . Hands, softer than he had been expecting, touched Harry's face, and felt his heart. He could hear the woman's fast breathing, her pounding of life against his ribs. \"Is Draco alive? Is he in the castle?\" The whisper was barely audible, her lips were an inch from his car, her head bent so low that her long hair shielded his face from the onlookers. \"Yes,\" he breathed back. He felt the hand on his chest contract: her nails pierced him. Then it was withdrawn. She had sat up. \"He is dead!\" Narcissa Malfoy called to the watchers. And now they shouted, now they yelled in triumph and stamped their feet, and through his eyelids, Harry saw bursts of red and silver light shoot into the air in celebration. Still feigning death on the ground, he understood. Narcissa knew that the only way she would be permitted to enter Hogwarts, and find her son, was as part of the conquering army. She no longer cared whether Voldemort won. \"You see?\" screeched Voldemort over the tumult. \"Harry Potter is dead by my hand, and no man alive can threaten me now! Watch! Crucio!\" Harry had been expecting it, knew his body would not be allowed to remain unsullied upon the forest floor; it must be subjected to humiliation to prove Voldemort's victory. He was lifted into the air, and it took all his determination to remain limp, yet the pain he expected did not come. He was thrown once, twice, three times into the air. His glasses flew off and he felt his wand slide a little beneath his robes, but he kept himself floppy and lifeless, and when he fell no ground for the last time, the clearing echoed with jeers and shrieks of laughter. \"Now,\" said Voldemort, \"we go to the castle, and show them what has become of their hero. Who shall drag the body? No - Wait - \" There was a fresh outbreak of laughter, and after a few moments Harry felt the ground trembling beneath him. \"You carry him,\" Voldemort said. \"He will be nice and visible in your arms, will he not? Pick up your little friend, Hagrid. And the glasses - put on the glasses - he must be recognizable - \" Someone slammed Harry's glasses back onto his face with deliberate force, but the enormous hands that lifted him into the air were exceedingly gentle. Harry could feel Hagrid's arms trembling with the force of his heaving sobs; great tears splashed down upon him as Hagrid cradled Harry in his arms, and Harry did not dare, by movement or word, to intimate to Hagrid that all was not, yet, lost. \"Move,\" said Voldemort, and Hagrid stumbled forward, forcing his way through the close-growing trees, back through the forest. Branches caught at Harry's hair and robes, but he lay quiescent, his mouth lolling open, his eyes shut, and in the darkness, while the Death Eaters croed all around them, and while Hagrid sobbed blindly, nobody looked to see whether a pulse beat in the exposed neck of Harry Potter. . . . The two giants crashed along behind the Death Eaters; Harry could hear trees creaking and falling as they passed; they made so much din that birds toes shrieking into the sky, and even the jeers of the Death Eaters were drowned. The victorious procession marched on toward the open ground, and after a while Harry could tell, by the lightening of the darkness through his closed eyelids, that the trees were beginning to thin. \"BANE!\" Hagrid's unexpected bellow nearly forced Harry's eyes open. \"Happy now, are yeh, that yeh didn't fight, yeh cowardly bunch o' nags? Are yeh happy Harry Potter's - d-dead . . . ?\" Hagrid could not continue, but broke down in fresh tears. Harry wondered how many centaurs were watching their procession pass; he dared not open his eyes to look. Some of the Death Eaters called insults at the centaurs as they left them behind. A little later, Harry sensed, by a freshening of the air, that they had reached the edge of the forest. \"Stop.\" Harry thought that Hagrid must have been forced to obey Voldemort's command, because he lurched a little. And now a chill settled over them where they sood, and Harry heard the rasping breath of the dementors that patrolled the other trees. They would not affect him now. The fact of his own survival burned inside him, a talisman against them, as though his father's stag kept guardian in his heart. Someone passed close by Harry, and he knew that it was Voldemort himself because he spoke a moment later, his voice magically magnified so that it swelled through the ground, crashing upon Harry's eardrums. \"Harry Potter is dead. He was killed as he ran away, trying to save himself while you lay down your lives for him. We bring you his body as proof that your hero is gone. \"The battle is won. You have lost half of your fighters. My Death Eaters outnumber you, and the Boy Who Lived is finished. There must be no more war. Anyone who continues to resist, man, woman or child, will be slaughtered, as will every member of their family. Come out of the castle now, kneel before me, and you shall be spared. Your parents and children, your brothers and sisters will live and be forgiven, and you will join me in the new world we shall build togheter.\" There was silence in the grounds and from the castle. Voldemort was so close to him that Harry did not dare open his eyes again. \"Come,\" said Voldemort, and Harry heard him move ahead, and Hagrid was forced to follow. Now Harry opened his eyes a fraction, and saw Voldemort striding in front them, wearing the great snake Nagini around his shoulders, now free of her enchanted cage. But Harry had no possibility of extracting the wand concealed under his robes without being noticed by the Death Eaters, who marched on the either side of them through the slowly lightening darkness . . . . \"Harry,\" sobbed Hagrid. \"Oh, Harry . . . Harry . . .\" Harry shut his eyes tight again. He knew that they were approaching the castle and strained his ears to distinguish, above the gleeful voices of the Death Eaters and their tramping footsteps, signs of life from those within. \"Stop.\" The Death Eaters camte to a halt; Harry heard them spreading out in a line facing the opne front doors of the school. He could see, even though his closed lids, the teddish glow that meant light streamed upon him from the entrance hall. He waited. Any moment, the people for whom he had tried to die would see him, lying apparently dead, in Hagrid's arms. \"NO!\" The scream was the more terrible because he had never expected or dreamed that Professor McGonagall could make such a sound. He heard another women laughing nearby, and knew that Bellatrix gloried in McGonagall's despair. He squinted again for a single second and saw the open doorway filling with people, as the survivors of the battle came out onto the front steps to face their vanquishers and see the truth of Harry's death for themselves. He saw Voldemort standing a little in front of him, stroking Nagini's head with a single white finger. He closed his eyes again. \"No!\" \"No!\" \"Harry! HARRY!\" Ron's, Hermione's, and Ginny's voices were worse than McGonagall's; Harry wanted nothing more than to call back, yet he made himself lie silent, and their cries acted like a trigger; the crowd of survivors took up the cause, screaming and yelling abuse at the Death Eathers, until - \"SILENCE!\" cried Voldemort, and there was a bang and a flash of bright light, and silence was forced upn them all. \"It is over! Set him down, Hagrid, at my feet, where he belongs!\" Harry felt himself lowered onto the grass. \"You see? said Voldemort, and Harry felt him striding backward and forward right beside the place where he lay. \"Harry Potter is dead! Do you understand now, deluded ones? He was nothing, ever, but a boy who relied on others to sacrifice themselves for him!\" \"He beat you!\" yelled Ron, and the charm broke, and the defenders of Hogwarts were shouting and screaming again until a second, more powerful bang extinguished their voices once more. \"He was killed while trying to sneak out of the castle grounds,\" said Voldemort, and there was a relish in his voice for the lie. \"killed while trying to save himself - \" But Voldemort broke off: Harry heard a scuffle and a shout, then another bang, a flash of light, and grunt of pain; he opened his eyes an infinitesimal amount. Someone had broken free of the crowd and charged at Voldemort: Harry saw the figure hit the ground. Disarmed, Voldemort throwing the challenger's wand aside and laughing. \"And who is this?\" he said in his soft snake's hiss. \"Who has volunteered to demonstrate what happens to those who continue to fight when the battle is lost?\" Bellatrix gave a delighted laugh. \"It is Neville Longbottom, my Lord! The boy who has been giving the Carrows so much trouble! The son of the Aurors, remember?\" \"Ah, yes, I remember,\" said Voldemort, looking down at Neville, who was struggling back to his feet, unarmed and unproctected, standing in the no-man's-land between the survivors and the Death Eaters. \"But you are a pureblood, aren't you, my brave boy? Voldemort asked Neville, who stood facing him, his empty hands curled in fists. \"So what if I am?\" said Neville loudly. \"You show spirit and bravery, and you come of noble stock. You will make a very valuable Death Eater. We need your kind, Neville Longbottom.\" \"I'll join you when hell freezes over,\" said Neville. \"Dumbledore's Army!\" he shouted, and there was an answering cheer from the crowd, whom Voldemort's Silencing Charms seemed unable to hold. \"Very well,\" said Voldemort, and Harry heard more danger in the silkiness of his voice than in the most powerful curse. \"If that is your choice, Longbottom, we revert to the original plan. On your head,\" he said quietly, \"be it.\" Still watching through his lashes, Harry saw Voldemort wave his wand. Seconds later, out of one of the castle's shattered windows, something that looked like a misshapen bird flew through the half light and landed in Voldemort's hand. He shook the mildewed object by its pointed end and it dangled, emtpy and ragged: the Sorting Hat. \"There will be no more Sorting at Hogwarts School,\" said Voldemort. \"There will be no more Houses. The emblem, sheild and colors of my noble ancestor, Salazar Slythering, will suffice everyone. Won't they, Neville Longbottom?\" He pointed his wand at Neville, who grew rigid and still, then forced the hat onto Neville's head, so thta it slipped down below his eyes. There were movements from the watching crowd in front of the castle, and as one, the Death Eaters raised their wands, holding the fighters of Hogwarts at bay. \"Neville here is now going to demonstrate what happens to anyone foolish enough to continue to oppose me,\" said Voldemort, and with a flick of his wand, he caused the Sorting Hat to burst into flames. Screams split the dawn, and Neville was a flame, rooted to the spot, unable to move, and Harry could not bear it: He must act - And then many things happened at the same moment. They heard uproar from the distant boundary of the school as what sounded like hundreds of people came swarming over the out-of-sight walls and pelted toward the castle, uttering lowd war cries. At the same time, Grawp came lumbering around the side of the castel and yelled, \"HAGGER!\" His cry was answered by roars from Voldemort's giants: They ran at Grawp like bull elephants making the earth quake. Then came hooves and the twangs of bows, and arrows were suddenly falling amongst the Death Eaters, who broke ranks, shouting their surprise. Harry pulled the Invisibilty Cloak from inside his robes, swunt it over himself, and sprang to his feet, as Neville moved too. In one swift, fluid motin, Neville broke free of the Body-Bind Curse upon him; the flaming har fell off him and he drew from its depths something silver, with a glittering, rubied handle - The slash of the silver blade could not be heard over the roar of the oncoming crowd or the sounds of the clashing giants or of te stampending centaurs, and yet, it seemd to draw every eye. With a single stroke Neville sliced off the great snake's head, which spun high into the air, gleaming in the light flooding from the entrance hall, and Voldemort's mouth was open in a scream of fury that nobody could hear, and the snake's body thudded to the ground at his feet- Hidden beneath the Invisibilty Cloak, Harry cast a Shield Charm between Neville and Voldemort before the latter could raise his stamps of the battling giants, Hagrid's yell came loudets of all. \"HARRY!\" Hagrid shouted. \"HARRY - WHERE'S HARRY?\" Chaos reigned. The charging centaurs were scattering the Death Eaters, everyone was feeling the giants' stamping feet, and nearer and nearar thundered the reinforcements that had come from who knew where; Harry saw great winget creatues soaring the heads of Voldemort's giants, thestrals and Buckbeak the hippogriff scratching at their eyes while Grawp punched and pummeled them and now the wizards, defenders of Hogwarts and Death Eaters alike were being forced back into the castle. Harry was shooting jinxes and curses at any Death Eater he could see, and they crumpled, not knowing what or who had hit them, and their bodies were trampled by the retreating crowd. Still hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, Harry was buffered into the entrance hall: He was searching for Voldemort and saw him across the room, firing spells from his wand as he backed into the Great Hall, still screaming instructions to his followers as he sent curses flying left and right; Harry cast more Shield Charms, and Voldemort's would-be victims. Seamus Finnigan and Hannah Abbott, datted past him into the Great Hall, where they joined the fight already flourishing inside it. And now there were more, even more people storming up the front steps, and Harry saw Charlie Weasly overtaking Horace Slughorn, who was still wearing his emeral pijamas. They seemed to have returned at the head of what looked like the families and friends of every Hogwarts student who had remained to fight along with the shopkeeps and homeowners of Hogsmeade. The centaurs Bane, Ronan and Magorian burst into the hall with a great clatter of hooves, as behind Harry the door that led to the kitchens was blasted off its hinges. The house-elves of Hogwarts swarmed intot he entrance hall, screaming and waving carving knives and cleaver, and at their head, the locker of Regulus Black bouncing on his chest, was Kreacher, his bullfrog's voice audible even above this din: \"Fight! Fight! Fight for my Master, defender of house-elves! Fight the Dark Lord, in the name of brave Regulus! Fight!\" They were hacking and stabbing at the ankles and shim of Death Eaters their tiny faces alive with malice, and everywhere Harry looked Death Eaters were folding under sheer weight of numbers, overcome by spells, dragging arrows from wounds, stabbed in the leg by elves, or else simply attempting to escape, but swallowed by the oncoming horde. But it was not over yet: Harry sped between duelers, past atruggling prosoners, and into he Great Hall. Voldemort was in the center of the battle, and he was striking and smiting al within reach. Harry could not get a clear shot, but fought his way nearer, still invisible, and the Great Hall became more and more crowded as everyone who could walk forced their way inside. Harry saw Yaxley slammed tot he floor by George and Lee Jordan, saw Dolohov fall with a scream at Flitwick's hands, saw Walden Macnair thrown across the room by Hagrid, hit the stone wall opposite, and slide unconscious to the ground. He saw Ron and Neville bringing down Fenrir Greyback. Aberforth Stunning Rookwood, Arthur and Percy flooting Thicknesse, and Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy running through the crowd, not even attempting to fight, screaming for their son. Voldemort was now dueling McGonagall, Slughorn, Kingsley all at once, and there was a cold hatred in his face as they wove and ducked around him, unable to finish him - Bellatrix was still fighing too, fifty yards away from Voldemort, and like her master she dueled three at once: Hermione, Ginny and Luna, all battling their hardest, but Bellatrix was equal to them, and Harry's attention was diverted as a Killing Curse shot so close to Ginny that she missed death by an inch - He changed course, running at Bellatrix rather than Voldemort, but before he had gone a few steps he was knocked sideways. \"NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!\" Mrs. Weasley threw off her cloak as she ran, freeing her arms, Bellatrix spun on the spot, roaring with laughter at the sight of the new challenger. \"OUT OF MY WAY!\" shouted Mrs. Weasley to the three girls, and with a simple swipe of her wand she began to duel. Harry watched with terror and elation as Molly Weasley's wand slashed and twisted, and Bellatrix Lestrange's smile faltered and became a snarl. Jets of light flew from both wands, the floor around the withces' feet became bot and cracked; both woman were fighting to kill. \"No!\" Mrs. Weasley cried as a few students ran forward, trying to come to her aid. \"Get back! Get back! She is mine!\" Hundreds of people now lined the walls, watching the two fights, Voldemort and his three opponents, Bellatrix and Molly, and Harry stood, invisible, torn between both, wanting to attack and yet to protect, unable to be sure that he would not hit the innocent. \"What will happen to your children when I've killed you?\" taunted Bellatrix, as mad as her master, capering as Molly's curses danced around her. \"When Mummy's gone the same way as Freddie?\" \"You - will - never - touch - our - children - again!\" screamed Mrs. Weasley. Bellatrix laughed the same exhilarated laugh her cousin Sirius had given as he toppled backward through the veil, and suddenly Harry knew what was going to happen before it did. Molly's curse soared beneath Bellatrix's constreched arm and hit her squarely in the chest, directly over her heart. Bellatrix's glounting smile froze, her eyes seemd to bulge: For the tiniest space of time she knew what had happened, and then she toppled, and the watching crowd roared, and Voldemord screamed. Harry felt as though he turned into slow motin: he saw McGonagall, Kingsley and Slughorn blasted backward, flailing and writhing through the air, as Voldemort's fury at the fall of his last, best leutenant exploded with the force of a bomb, Voldemort raised his wand and directed it at Molly Weasley. \"Protego!\" roared Harry, and the Shield Charm expanded in the middle of the Hall, and Voldemort stared around for the source as Harry pulled off the Invisibility Cloak at last. The yell of shock, the cheers, the screams on every side of :\"Harry!\" \"HE'S ALIVE!\" were stifled at once. The crowd was afraid, and silence fell abruptly and completely as Voldemort and Harry looked at each other, and began, at the same moment, to circle each other. \"I don't want anyone else to help,\" Harry said loudly, and in the total silence his voice carried like a trumpet call. \"It's got to be like this. It's got to be me.\" Voldemort hissed. \"Potter doesn't mean that,\" he said, his red eyes wide. \"This isn't how he works, is it? Who are you going to use as a shield today, Potter?\" \"Nobody,\" said Harry simply. \"There are no more Horcruxes. It's just you and me. Neither can live while the other survives, and one of us is about to leave for good. . . .\" \"One of us?\" jeered Voldemort, and his wholy body was taut and his red eyes stared, a snake that was about to strike. \"You think it will be you, do you, the boy who has survived by accident, and because Dumbledore was pulling the strings?\" \"Accident, was it, when my mother died to save me?\" asked Harry. They were still moving sideways, both of them, in that perfect circle, maintaining the same distance from each other, and for Harry no face existed but Voldemort's. \"Accident, when I decided to fight in that graveyard? Accident, that I didn't defend myself tonight, and still survived, and returned to fight again?\" \"Accidents!\" screamed Voldemort, but still he did not strike, and the watching crowd was frozen as if Petrified, and of the hundreds in the Hall, nobody seemed to breathe but they two. \"Accident and chance and the fact that you crouched and sniveled behind the skirts of greater men and women, and permitted me to kill them for you!\" \"You won't be killing anyone else tonight,\" said Harry as they circled, and stared into each other's eyes, green into red. \"You won't be able to kill any of them ever again. Don't you get it? I was ready to die to stop you from hurting these people - \" \"But you did not!\" \" - I meant to, and that's what did it. I've done what my mother did. They're protected from you. Haven't you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding? You can't torture them. You can't touch them. You don't learn from your mistakes, Riddle, do you?\" \"You dare -\" \"Yes, I dare,\" said Harry. \"I know things you don't know, Tom Riddle. I know lots of important things that you don't. Want to hear some, before you make another big mistake?\" Voldemort did not speak, but powled in a circle, and Harry knew that he kept him temporarily mesmerized at bay, held back by the faintest possibility that Harry might indeed know a final secret. . . . \"Is it love again?\" said Voldemort, his snake's face jeering. \"Dumbledore favorite solution, love, which he claimed conqered death, though love did not stop him falling from the tower and breaking like and old waxwork? Love, which did not prevent me stamping out your Modblood mother like a cockroack, Potter - and nobody seems to love you enough to run forward this time and take my curse. So what will stop you dying now when I strike?\" \"Just one thing,\" said Harry, and still they circled each other, wrapped in each other, held apart by nothing but the last secret. \"If it is not love that will save you this time,\" said Voldemort, \"you must believe that you have magic that i do not, or else a weapon more powerful than mine?\" \"I believe both,\" said Harry, and he saw shock flit across the snakelike face, though it was instantly dispelled; Voldemort began to laugh, and the sound was more frightening than his screams; humorles and insane, it echoed around the silent Hall. \"You think you know more magic than I do?\" he said. \"Than I, than Lord Voldemort, who has performed magic that Dumbledore himself never dreamed of?\" \"Oh he dreamed of it,\" said Harry, \"but he knew more than you, knew enough not to do what you've done.\" \"You mean he was weak!\" screamed Voldemort. \"Too weak to dare, too weak to take what might have been his, what will be mine!\" \"No, he was cleverer than you,\" said Harry, \"a better wizard, a better man.\" \"I brought about the death of Albus Dumbledore!\" \"You thought you did,\" said Harry, \"but you were wrong.\" For the frist time, the watching crowd stirred as the hundreds of people around the walls drew breath as one. \"Dumbledore is dead!\" Voldemort hurled the words at Harry as in the marble tomb in the grounds of this castle, I have seen it, Potter, and he will not return!\" \"Yes, Dumbledore is dead,\" said Harry calmly, \"but you didn't have him killed. He chose his own manner of dying, chose it months before he died, arranged the whole thing with the man you thought was your servant.\" \"What chldish dream is this?\" said Voldemort, but still he did not strike, and his red eyes did not waver from Harry's. \"Severus Snape wasn't yours,\" said Harry. \"Snape was Dumbledore's. Dumbledore's from the moment you starting hunting down my mother. And you never realized it, because of the thing you can't understand. You never saw Snape cast a Patronus, did you, Riddle?\" Voldemort did not answer. They continued to circle each other like wolves about to tear each other apart. \"Snape's Patronus was a doe,\" said Harry, \"the same as my mother's, because he loved her for nearly all of his life, from the time when they were children. You should have realized,\" he said as he saw Voldemort's nostrils flare, \"he asked you to spare her life, didn't he?\" \"He desired her, that was all,\" sneered Voldemort, \"but when she had gone, he agreed that there were other women, and of purer blood, worhier of him - \" \"Of course he told you that,\" said Harry, \"but he was Dumbledore's spy from the moment you threatened her, and he's been working against you ever since! Dumbledore was already dying when Snape finished him!\" \"It matters not!\" shrieked Voldemort, who had followed every word with rapt attention, but now let out a cackle of mad laughter. \"It matters not whether Snape was mine or Dumbledore's, or what petty obstacles they tried to put in my path! I crushed them as I crushed your mother, Snape's supposed great love! Oh, but it all makes sense, Potter, and in ways that you do not understand! \"Dumbledore was trying to keep the Elder Wand from me! He intended that Snape should be the true master of the wand! But I got there ahead of you, little boy - I reached the wand before you could get your hands on it, I understood the truth before you caught up. I killed Severus Snape three hours ago, and the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny is truly mine! Dumbledore's last plan went wrong, Harry Potter!\" \"Yeah, it did.\" said Harry. \"You're right. But before you try to kill me, I'd advise you think what you've done . . . . Think, and try for some remorse, Riddle. . . .\" \"What is this?\" Of all the things that Harry had said to him, beyond any revelation or taunt, nothing had socked Voldemort like this. Harry saw is pupils contract to thin slits, saw the skin around his eyes whiten. \"It's your one last chance,\" said Harry, \"it's all you've got left. . . . I've seen what you'll be otherwise. . . . Be a man. . . try. . . Try for some remorse. . . .\" \"You dare --- ?\" said Voldemort again. \"Yes, I dare,\" said Harry, \"because Dumbledore’s last plan hasn’t backfired on me at all. It’s backfired on you, Riddle.\" Voldemort’s hand was trembling on the Elder Wand, and Harry gripped Draco’s very tightly. The moment, he knew, was seconds away. \"That wand still isn’t working properly for you because you murdered the wrong person. Severus Snape was never the true master of the Elder Wand. He never defeated Dumbledore.\" \"He killed --- \" \"Aren’t you listening? Snape never beat Dumbledore! Dumbledore’s death was planned between them! Dumbledore instended to die, undefeated, the wand’s last true master! If all had gone as planned, the wand’s power would have died with him, because it had never been won from him!\" \"But then, Potter, Dumbledore as good as gave me the wand!\" Voldemort’s voice shook with malicious pleasure. \"I stole the wand from its last master’s tomb! I removed it against the last master’s wishes! Its power is mine!\" \"You still don’t get it, Riddle, do you? Possessing the wand isn’t enough! Holding it, using it, doesn’t make it really yours. Didn’t you listen to Ollivander? The wand chooses the wizard . . . The Elder Wand recognized a new master before Dumbledore died, someone who never even laid a hand on it. The new master removed the wand from Dumbledore against his will, never realizing exactly what he had done, or that the world’s most dangerous wand had given him its allegiance . . .\" Voldemort’s chest rose and fell rapidly, and Harry could feel the curse coming, feel it building inside the wand pointed at his face. \"The true master of the Elder Wand was Draco Malfoy.\" Blank shock showed in Voldemort’s face for a moment, but then it was gone. \"But what does it matter?\" he said softly. \"Even if you are right, Potter, it makes no difference to you and me. You no longer have the phoenix wand: We duel on skill alone . . . and after I have killed you, I can attend to Draco Malfoy . . .\" \"But you’re too late,\" said Harry. \"You’ve missed your chance. I got there first. I overpowered Draco weeks ago. I took his wand from him.\" Harry twitched the hawthorn wand, and he felt the eyes of everyone in the Hall upon it. \"So it all comes down to this, doesn’t it?\" whispered Harry. \"Does the wand in your hand know its last master was Disarmed? Because if it does . . . I am the true master of the Elder Wand.\" A red-glow burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above them as an edge of dazzling sun appeared over the sill of the nearest window. The light hit both of their faces at the same time, so that Voldemort’s was suddenly a flaming blur. Harry heard the high voice shriek as he too yelled his best hope to the heavens, pointing Draco’s wand: \"Avada Kedavra!\" \"Expelliarmus!\" The bang was like a cannon blast, and the golden flames that erupted between them, at the dead center of the circle they had been treading, marked the point where the spells collided. Harry saw Voldemort’s green jet meet his own spell, saw the Elder Wand fly high, dark against the sunrise, spinning across the enchanted ceiling like the head of Nagini, spinning through the air toward the master it would not kill, who had come to take full possession of it at last. And Harry, with the unerring skill of the Seeker, caught the wand in his free hand as Voldemort fell backward, arms splayed, the slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upward. Tom Riddle hit the floor with a mundane finality, his body feeble and shrunken, the white hands empty, the snakelike face vacant and unknowing. Voldemort was dead, killed by his own rebounding curse, and Harry stood with two wands in his hand, staring down at his enemy’s shell. One shivering second of silence, the shock of the moment suspended: and then the tumult broke around Harry as the screams and the cheers and the roars of the watchers rent the air. The fierce new sun dazzled the windows as they thundered toward him, and the first to reach him were Ron and Hermione, and it was their arms that were wrapped around him, their incomprehensible shouts that deafened him. The Ginny, Neville, and Luna were there, and then all the Weasleys and Hagrid, and Kingsley and McGonagall and Flitwick and Sprout, and Harry could not hear a word that anyone was shouting, not tell whose hands were seizing him, pulling him, trying to hug some part of him, hundreds of them pressing in, all of them determined to touch the Boy Who Lived, the reason it was over at last --- The sun rose steadily over Hogwarts, and the Great Hall blazed with life and light. Harry was an indispensible part of the mingled outpourings of jubilation and mourning, of grief and celebration. They wanted him there with them, their leader and symbol, their savior and their guide, and that he had not slept, that he craved the company of only a few of them, seemed to occur to no one. He must speak to the bereaved, clasp their hands, witness their tears, receive their thanks, hear the news now creeping in from every quarter as the morning drew on; that the Imperiused up and down the country had come back to themselves, that Death Eaters were fleeing or else being captured, that the innocent of Azkaban were being released at that very moment, and that Kingsley Shacklebolt had been named temporary Minister of Magic. They moved Voldemort’s body and laid it in a chamber off the Hall, away form the bodies of Fred, Tonks, Lupin, Colin Creevey, and fifty others who had died fighting him. McGonagall had replaced the House tables, not nobody was sitting according to House anymore: All were jumbled together, teachers and pupils, ghosts and parents, centaurs and house-elves, and Firenze lay recovering in the corner, and Grawp peered in through a smashed window, and people were throwing food into his laughing mouth. After a while, exhausted and drained, Harry found himself sitting on a bench beside Luna. \"I’d want some peace and quiet, if it were me,\" she said. \"I’d love some,\" he replied. \"I’ll distract them all,\" she said. \"Use your cloak.\" And before he could say a word, she had cried, \"Oooh, look, a Blibbering Humdinger!\" and pointed out the window. Everyone who heard looked around, and Harry slid the Cloak up over himself, and got to his feet. Now he could move through the Hall without interference. He spotted Ginny two tables away; she was sitting with her head on her mother’s shoulder: There would be time to talk later, hours and days and maybe years in which to talk. He saw Neville, the sword of Gryffindor lying beside his plate as he ate, surrounded by a knot of fervent admirers. Along the aisle between the tables he walked, and he spotted the three Malfoys, huddled together as though unsure whether or not they were supposed to be there, but nobody was paying them any attention. Everywhere he looked, he saw families reunited, and finally, he saw the two whose company he craved most. \"It’s me,\" he muttered, crouching down between them. \"Will you come with me?\" They stood up at once, and together he, Ron and Hermione left the Great Hall. Great chunks were missing from the marble staircase, part of the balustrade gone, and rubble and bloodstains occurred ever few steps as their climbed. Somewhere in the distance they could hear Peeves zooming through the corridors singing a victory song of his own composition: We did it, we bashed them, wee Potter’s the one, And Voldy’s gone moldy, so now let’s have fun! \"Really gives a feeling for the scope and tragedy of the thing, doesn’t it?\" said Ron, pushing open a door to let Harry and Hermione through. Happiness would come, Harry though, but at the moment it was muffled by exhaustion, and the pain of losing Fred and Lupin and Tonks pierced him like a physical wound every few steps. Most of all he felt the most stupendous relief, and a longing to sleep. But first he owed an explanation to Ron and Hermione, who had stuck with him for so long, and who deserved the truth. Painstakingly he recounted what he had seem in the Pensieve and what had happened in the forest, and they had not even begun to express all their shock and amazement, when at last they arrived at the place to which they had been walking, though none of them had mentioned their destination. Since he had last seen it, the gargoyle guarding the entrance to the headmaster’s study had been knocked aside; it stood lopsided, looking a little punch-drunk, and Harry wondered whether it would be able to distinguish passwords anymore. \"Can we go up?\" he asked the gargoyle. \"Feel free,\" groaned the statue. They clambered over him and onto the spiral stone staircase that moved slowly upward like an escalator. Harry pushed open the door at the top. He had one, brief glimpse of the stone Pensieve on the desk where he had left it, and then an earsplitting noise made him cry out, thinking of curses and returning Death Eaters and the rebirth of Voldemort --- But it was applause. All around the walls, the headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts were giving him a standing ovation; they waved their hats and in some cases their wigs, they reached through their frames to grip each other’s hands; they danced up and down on their chairs in which they have been painted: Dilys Derwent sobbed unashamedly; Dexter Fortescue was waving his ear-trumpet; and Phineas Niggelus called, in his high, reedy voice, \"And let it be noted that Slytherin House played its part! Let our contribution not be forgotten!\" But Harry had eyes only for the man who stood in the largest portrait directly behind the headmaster’s chair. Tears were sliding down from behind the half-moon spectacles into the long silver beard, and the pride and the gratitude emanating from him filled Harry wit h the same balm as phoenix song. At last, Harry held up his hands, and the portraits fell respectfully silent, beaming and mopping their eyes and waiting eagerly for him to speak. He directed his words at Dumbledore, however, and chose them with enormous care. Exhausted and bleary-eyed though he was, he must make one last effort, seeking one last piece of advice. \"The thing that was hidden in the Snitch,\" he began, \"I dropped it in the forest. I don’t exactly here, but I’m not going to go looking for it again. Do you agree?\" \"My dear boy, I do,\" said Dumbledore, while his fellow pictures looked confused and curious. \"A wise and courageous decision, but no less than I would have expected of you. Does anyone know else know where it fell?\" \"No one,\" said Harry, and Dumbledore nodded his satisfaction. \"I’m going to keep Ignotus’s present, though,\" said Harry, and Dumbledore beamed. \"But of course, Harry, it is yours forever, until you pass it on!\" \"And then there’s this.\" Harry held up the Elder Wand, and Ron and Hermione looked at it with a reverence that, even in his befuddled and sleep-deprived state, Harry did not like to see. \"I don’t want it.\" said Harry. \"What?\" said Ron loudly. \"Are you mental?\" \"I know it’s powerful,\" said Harry wearily. \"But I was happier with mine. So . . .\" He rummaged in the pouch hung around his neck, and pulled out the two halves of holly tstill just connected by the finest threat of phoenix feather. Hermione had said that they could not be repaired, that the damage was too severe. All he knew was that if this did not work, nothing would. He laid the broken wand upon the headmaster’s desk, touched it with the very tip of the Elder Wand, and said, \"Reparo.\" As his wand resealed, red sparks flew out of its end. Harry knew that he had succeeded. He picked up the holly and phoenix wand and felt a sudden warmth in his fingers, as though wand and hand were rejoicing at their reunion. \"I’m putting the Elder Wand,\" he told Dumbledore, who was watching him with enormous affection and admiration, \"back where it came from. It can stay there. If I die a natural death like Ignotus, its power will be broken, won’t it? The previous master will never have been defeated. That’ll be the end of it. Dumbledore nodded. They smiled at each other. \"Are you sure?\" said Ron. There was the faintest trace of longing in his voice as he looked at the Elder Wand. \"I think Harry’s right,\" said Hermione quietly. \"That wand’s more trouble than it’s worth.\" said Harry. \"And quite honestly,\" he turned away from the painted portraits, thinking now only of the four-poster bed lying waiting for him in Gryffindor Tower, and wondering whether Kreacher might bring him a sandwich there, \"I’ve had enough trouble for a lifetime.\" Epilogue Nineteen Years Later Autumn seemed to arrive suddenly that year. The morning of the first of September was crisp as an apple, and as the little family bobbed across the rumbling road toward the great sooty station, the fumes of car exhausts and the breath of pedestrians sparkled like cobwebs in the cold air. Two large cages tattled on top of the laden trolleys the parents were pushing; the owls inside them hooted indignantly, and the redheaded girl trailed fearfully behind here brothers, clutching her father's arm. \"It won't be long, and you'll be going too,\" Harry told her. \"Two years,\" sniffed Lily. \"I want to go now!\" The commuters stared curiously at the owls as the family wove its way toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten, Albus's voice drifted back to Harry over the surrounding clamor; his sons had resumed the argument they had started in the car. \"I won't! I won't be a Slytherin!\" \"James, give it a rest!\" said Ginny. \"I only said he might be,\" said James, grinning at his younger brother. \"There's nothing wrong with that. He might be in Slytherin\" But James caught his mother's eye and fell silent. The five Potters approached the barrier. With a slightly cocky look over his shoulder at his younger brother, James took the trolley from his mother and broke into a run. A moment later, he had vanished. \"You'll write to me, won't you?\" Albus asked his parents immediately, capitalizing on the momentary absence of his brother. \"Every day, of you want us to,\" said Ginny. \"Not every day,\" said Albus quickly, \"James says most people only get letters from home about once a month.\" \"We wrote to James three times a week last year,\" said Ginny. \"And you don't want to believe everything he tells you about Hogwarts,\" Harry put in. \"He likes a laugh, your brother.\" Side by side, they pushed the second trolley forward, gathering speed. As they reached the barrier, Albus winced, but no collision came. Instead, the family emerged onto platform nine and three-quarters, which was obscured by thick white steam that was pouring from the scarlet Hogwarts Express. Indistinct figures were swarming through the mist, into which James had already disappeared. \"Where are they?\" asked Albus anxiously, peering at the hazy forms they passed as they made their way down the platform. \"We'll find them,\" said Ginny reassuringly. But the vapor was dense, and it was difficult to make out anybody's faces. Detached from their owners, voices sounded unnaturally loud, Harry thought he head Percy discoursing loudly on broomstick regulations, and was quite glad of the excuse not to stop and say hello. . . . \"I think that's them, Al,\" said Ginny suddenly. A group of four people emerged from the mist, standing alongside the very last carriage. Their faces only came into focus when Harry, Ginny, Lily, and Albus had drawn right up to them. \"Hi,\" said Albus, sounding immensely relieved. Roses, who was already wearing her brand-new Hogwarts robes, beamed at him. \"Parked all right, then?\" Ron asked Harry. \"I did. Hermione didn't believe I could pass a Muggle driving test, did you? She thought I'd have to Confound the examiner.\" \"No, I didn't,\" said Hermione, \"I had complete faith in you.\" \"As a matter of fact, I did Confund him,\" Ron whispered to Harry, as together they lifted Albus's trunk and owl onto the train. \"I only forgot to look in the wing mirror, and let's face it, I can use a Supersensory Charm for that.\" Back on the platform, they found Lily and Hugo, Rose's younger brother, having an animated discussion about which House they would be sorted into when they finally went to Hogwarts. \"If you're not in Gryffindor, we'll disinherit you,\" said Ron, \"but no pressure.\" \"Ron!\" Lily and Hugo laughed, but Albus and Rose looked solemn. \"He doesn't mean it,\" said Hermione and Ginny, but Ron was no longer paying attention. Catching Harry's eye, he nodded covertly to a point some fifty yards away. The steam had thinned for a moment, and three people stood in sharp relief against the shifting mist. \"Look who it is.\" Draco Malfoy was standing there with his wife and son, a dark coat buttoned up to his throat. His hair was receding somewhat, which emphasized the pointed chin. The new boy resembled Draco as much as Albus resembled Harry. Draco caught sight of Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny staring at him, nodded curtly, and turned away again. \"So that's little Scorpius,\" said Ron under his breath. \"Make sure you beat him in every test, Rosie. Thank God you inherited your mother's brains.\" \"Ron, for heaven's sake,\" said Hermione, half stern, half amused. \"Don't try to turn them against each other before they've even started school!\" \"You're right, sorry,\" said Ron, but unable to help himself, he added, \"Don't get too friendly with him, though, Rosie. Granddad Weasley would never forgive you if you married a pureblood.\" \"Hey!\" James had reappeared; he had divested himself of his trunk, owl, and trolley, and was evidently bursting with news. \"Teddy's back there,\" he said breathlessly, pointing back over his shoulder into the billowing clouds of steam. \"Just seen him! And guess what he's doing? Snogging Victoire!\" He gazed up at the adults, evidently disappointed by the lack of reaction. \"Our Teddy! Teddy Lupin! Snogging our Victoire! Our cousin! And I asked teddy what he was doing --\" \"You interrupted them?\" said Ginny. \"You are so like Ron --\" \"-- and he said he'd come to see her off! And then he told me to go away. He's snogging her!\" James added as though worried he had not made himself clear. \"Oh, it would be lovely if they got married!\" whispered Lily ecstatically. \"Teddy would really be part of the family then!\" \"He already comes round for dinner about four times a week,\" said Harry \"Why don't we just invite him to live with is and have done with it?\" \"Yeah!\" said James enthusiastically. \"I don't mind sharing with Al--Teddy could have my room!\" \"No,\" said Harry firmly, \"you and Al will share a room only when I want the house demolished.\" He checked the battered old watch that had once been Fabian Prewett's. \"It's nearly eleven, you'd better get on board.\" \"Don't forget to give Neville our love!\" Ginny told James as she hugged him. \"Mum! I can't give a professor love!\" \"But you know Neville--\" James rolled his eyes. \"Outside, yeah, but at school he's Professor Longbottom, isn't he? I can't walk into Herbology and give him love. . . .\" Shaking his head at his mother's foolishness, he vented his feelings by aiming a kick at Albus. \"See you later, Al. Watch out for the thestrals.\" \"I thought they were invisible? You said they were invisible!\" but James merely laughed, permitted his mother to kiss him, gave his father a fleeting hug, then leapt onto the rapidly filling train. They saw him wave, then sprint away up the corridor to find his friends. \"Thestrals are nothing to worry about,\" Harry told Albus. \"They're gentle things, there's nothing scare about them. Anyway, you won't be going up to school in the carriages, you'll be going in the boats.\" Ginny kissed Albus good-bye. \"See you at Christmas.\" \"Bye, Al,\" said Harry as his son hugged him. \"Don't forget Hagrid's invited you to tea next Friday. Don't mess with Peeves. Don't duel anyone till you're learned how. And don't let James wind you up.\" \"What if I'm in Slytherin?\" The whisper was for his father alone, and Harry knew that only the moment of departure could have forced Albus to reveal how great and sincere that fear was. Harry crouched down so that Albus's face was slightly above his own. Alone of Harry's three children, Albus had inherited Lily's eyes. \"Ablus Severus,\" Harry said quietly, so that nobody but Ginny could hear, and she was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to rose, who was now on the train, \"you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.\" \"But just say--\" \"--then Slytherin House will have gained an excellent student, won't it? It doesn't matter to us, Al. But if it matter to you, you'll be able to choose Gryffindor over Slytherin. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.\" \"Really?\" \"It did for me,\" said Harry. He had never told any of his children that before, and he saw the wonder in Albus's face when he said it. But how the doorsr were slamming all along the scarlet train, and the blurred outlines of parents swarming forward for final kisses, last-minute reminders, Albus jumped into the carriage and ginny closed the door behind him. Students were hanging from the windows nearest them. A great number of faces, both on the train and off, seemed to be turned toward Harry. \"Why are they all staring?\" demanded Albus as he and rose craned around to look at the other students. \"Don't let it worry you,\" said Ron. \"It's me, I'm extremely famous.\" Albus, Rose, Hugo, and Lily laughed. The train began to more, and Harry walked alongside it, watching his son's thin face, already ablaze with excitement. Harry kept smiling and waving, even though it was like a little bereavement, watching his son glide away from him. . . . The last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn air. The train rounded a corner. Harry's hand was still raised in farewell. \"He'll be alright,\" murmured Ginny. As Harry looked dat her, he lowered his hand absentmindedly and touched the lightning scar on his forehead. \"I know he will.\" The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well.\n",

            ": Birthday Surprises The next day Harry confided in both Ron and Hermione the task that Dumbledore had set him, though separately, for Hermione still refused to remain in Ron's presence longer than it took to give him a contemptuous look. Ron thought that Harry was unlikely to have any trouble with Slughorn at all. 'He loves you,' he said over breakfast, waving an airy forkful of fried egg. 'Won't refuse you anything, will he? Not his little Potions Prince. Just hang back after class this afternoon and ask him.' Hermione, however, took a gloomier view. 'He must be determined to hide what really happened if Dumbledore couldn't get it out of him,' she said in a low voice, as they stood in the deserted, snowy courtyard at break. 'Horcruxes ... Horcruxes ... I've never even heard of them ...' 'You haven't?' Harry was disappointed; he had hoped that Hermione might have been able to give him a clue as to what Horcruxes were. 'They must be really advanced Dark magic, or why would Voldemort have wanted to know about them? I think it's going to be difficult to get the information, Harry, you'll have to be very careful about how you approach Slughorn, think out a strategy ...\" 'Ron reckons 1 should just hang back after Potions this afternoon ...' 'Oh, well, if Won-Won thinks that, you'd better do it,' she said, flaring up at once. 'After all, when has Won-Won's judgement ever been faulty?' 'Hermione, can't you --' 'No!' she said angrily, and stormed away, leaving Harry alone and ankle-deep in snow. Potions lessons were uncomfortable enough these days, seeing as Harry, Ron and Hermione had to share a desk. Today, Hermione moved her cauldron around the table so that she was close to Ernie, and ignored both Harry and Ron. 'What've you done?' Ron muttered to Harry, looking at Hermione's haughty profile. But before Harry could answer, Slughorn was calling for silence from the front of the room. 'Settle down, settle down, please! Quickly, now, lots of work to get through this afternoon! Golpalott's Third Law ... who can tell me -? But Miss Granger can, of course!' Hermione recited at top speed: 'Golpalott's-Third-Law- states-that-the-antidote-for-a-blended-poison-will-be-equal-to- more-than-the-sum-of-the-antidotes-for-each-of-the-separale- components.' 'Precisely!' beamed Slughorn. Ten points for Gryffindor! Now, if we accept Golpalott's Third Law as true ...\" Harry was going to have to take Slughorn's word for it that Golpalott's Third Law was true, because he had not under-stood any of it. Nobody apart from Hermione seemed to be following what Slughorn said next, either. '... which means, of course, that assuming we have achieved correct identification of the potion's ingredients by Scarpin's Revelaspell, our primary aim is not the relatively simple one of selecting antidotes to those ingredients in a of themselves, but to find that added component which will, by an almost alchemical process, transform these disparate elements -' Ron was sitting beside Harry with his mouth half-open, doodling absently on his new copy of Advanced Potion-Making. Ron kept forgetting that he could no longer rely on Hermione to help him out of trouble when he failed to grasp what was going on. '... and so,' finished Slughorn, 'I want each of you to come and take one of these phials from my desk. You are to create an antidote for the poison within it before the end of the lesson. Good luck, and don't forget your protective gloves!' Hermione had left her stool and was halfway towards Siughorn's desk before the rest of the class had realised it was time to move, and by the time Harry, Ron and Ernie returned to the table, she had already tipped the contents of her phial into her cauldron and was kindling a fire underneath it. 'it's a shame that the Prince won't be able to help you much with this, Harry,' she said brightly as she straightened up. 'You have to understand the principles involved this time. No short cuts or cheats!' Annoyed, Harry uncorked the poison he had taken from Siughorn's desk, which was a garish shade of pink, tipped it into his cauldron and lit a fire underneath it. He did not have the faintest idea what he was supposed to do next. He glanced at Ron, who was now standing there looking rather gormless, having copied everything Harry had done. 'You sure the Prince hasn't got any tips?' Ron muttered to Harry. Harry pulled out his trusty copy of Advanced Potion-Making and turned to the chapter on Antidotes. There was Golpalott's Third Law, stated word for word as Hermione had recited it, but not a single illuminating note in the Prince's hand to explain what it meant. Apparently the Prince, like Hermione, had had no difficulty understanding it. 'Nothing,' said Harry gloomily. Hermione was now waving her wand enthusiastically over her cauldron. Unfortunately, they could not copy the spell she was doing because she was now so good at non-verbal incan-tations that she did not need to say the words aloud. Ernie Macmillan, however, was muttering, 'Specialis revelio!' over his cauldron, which sounded impressive, so Harry and Ron hastened to imitate him. It took Harry only five minutes to realise that his reputa-tion as the best potion-maker in the class was crashing around his ears. Slughorn had peered hopefully into his cauldron on his first circuit of the dungeon, preparing to exclaim in delight as he usually did, and instead had with-drawn his head hastily, coughing, as the smell of bad eggs overwhelmed him. Hermione's expression could not have been any smugger; she had loathed being out-performed in every Potions class. She was now decanting the mysteriously separated ingredients of her poison into ten different crystal phials. More to avoid watching this irritating sight than any-thing else, Harry bent over the Half-Blood Prince's book and turned a few pages with unnecessary force. And there it was, scrawled right across a long list of antidotes. Just shove a bezoar down their throats. Harry stared at these words for a moment. Hadn't he once, long ago, heard of bezoars? Hadn't Snape mentioned them in their first ever Potions lesson? 'A stone taken from the stomach of a goat, which will protect from most poisons.' It was not an answer to the Golpalott problem, and had Snape still been their teacher, Harry would not have dared do it, but this was a moment for desperate measures. He hastened towards the store cupboard and rummaged within it, pushing aside unicorn horns and tangles of dried herbs until he found, at the very back, a small card box on which had been scribbled the word 'Bezoars'. He opened the box just as Slughorn called, Two minutes left, everyone!' Inside were half a dozen shrivelled brown objects, looking more like dried-up kidneys than real stones. Harry seized one, put the box back in the cupboard and hurried back to his cauldron. 'Time's ... UP!' called Slughorn genially. 'Well, let's see how you've done! Blaise ... what have you got for me?' Slowly, Slughorn moved around the room, examining the various antidotes. Nobody had finished the task, although Hermione was trying to cram a few more ingredients into her bottle before Slughorn reached her. Ron had given up com-pletely, and was merely trying to avoid breathing in the putrid fumes issuing from his cauldron. Harry stood there waiting, the bezoar clutched in a slightly sweaty hand. Slughorn reached their table last. He sniffed Ernie's potion and passed on to Ron's with a grimace. He did not linger over Ron's cauldron, but backed away swiftly, retching slightly. 'And you, Harry,' he said. 'What have you got to show me?' Harry held out his hand, the bezoar sitting on his palm. Slughorn looked down at it for a full ten seconds. Harry wondered, for a moment, whether he was going to shout at him. Then he threw back his head and roared with laughter. 'You've got a nerve, boy!' he boomed, taking the bezoar and holding it up so that the class could see it. 'Oh, you're like your mother ... well, 1 can't fault you ... a bezoar would certainly act as an antidote to all these potions!' Hermione, who was sweaty-faced and had soot on her nose, looked livid. Her half-finished antidote, comprising fifty-two ingredients including a chunk of her own hair, bubbled sluggishly behind Slughorn, who had eyes for nobody but Harry. 'And you thought of a bezoar all by yourself, did you, Harry?' she asked through gritted teeth. That's the individual spirit a real potion-maker needs!' said Slughorn happily, before Harry could reply. 'Just like his mother, she had the same intuitive grasp of potion-making, it's undoubtedly from Lily he gets it ... yes, Harry, yes, if you've got a bezoar to hand, of course that would do the trick ... although as they don't work on everything, and are pretty rare, it's still worth knowing how to mix antidotes ...' The only person in the room looking angrier than Hermione was Malfoy, who, Harry was pleased to see, had spilled some-thing that looked like cat sick over himself. Before either of them could express their fury that Harry had come top of the class by not doing any work, however, the bell rang. Time to pack up!' said Slughorn. 'And an extra ten points to Gryffindor for sheer cheek!' Still chuckling, he waddled back to his desk at the front of the dungeon. Harry dawdled behind, taking an inordinate amount of time to do up his bag. Neither Ron nor Hermione wished him luck as they left; both looked rather annoyed. At last Harry and Slughorn were the only two left in the room. 'Come on, now, Harry, you'll be late for your next lesson,' said Slughorn affably, snapping the gold clasps shut on his dragonskin briefcase. 'Sir,' said Harry, reminding himself irresistibly of Voldemort, '1 wanted to ask you something.' 'Ask away, then, my dear boy, ask away ...\" 'Sir, 1 wondered what you know about ... about Horcruxes?' Slughorn froze. His round face seemed to sink in upon itself. He licked his lips and said hoarsely, 'What did you say?' 'I asked whether you know anything about Horcruxes, sir. You see -' 'Dumbledore put you up to this,' whispered Slughorn. His voice had changed completely. It was not genial any more, but shocked, terrified. He fumbled in his breast pocket and pulled out a handkerchief, mopping his sweating brow. 'Dumbledore's shown you that - that memory,' said Slughorn. 'Well? Hasn't he?' 'Yes,' said Harry, deciding on the spot that it was best not to lie. 'Yes, of course,' said Slughorn quietly, still dabbing at his white face. 'Of course ... well, if you've seen that memory, Harry, you'll know that I don't know anything - anything -he repeated the word forcefully '- about Horcruxes.' He seized his dragonskin briefcase, stuffed his handkerchief back into his pocket and marched to the dungeon door. 'Sir,' said Harry desperately, 'I just thought there might be a bit more to the memory -' 'Did you?' said Slughorn. Then you were wrong, weren't you? WRONG!' He bellowed the last word and, before Harry could say another word, slammed the dungeon door behind him. Neither Ron nor Hermione was at all sympathetic when Harry told them of this disastrous interview Hermione was still seething at the way Harry had triumphed without doing the work properly. Ron was resentful that Harry hadn't slipped him a bezoar, too. 'It would've just looked stupid if we'd both done it!' said Harry irritably. 'Look, I had to try and soften him up so I could ask him about Voldemort, didn't I? Oh, will you gel a grip!' he added in exasperation, as Ron winced at the sound of the name. Infuriated by his failure and by Ron and Hermione's atti- tudes, Harry brooded for the next few days over what to do next about Slughorn. He decided that, for the time being, he would let Slughorn think that he had forgotten all about Horcruxes; it was surely best to lull him into a false sense of security before returning to the attack. When Harry did noi question Slughorn again, the Potions master reverted to his usual affectionate treatment of him, and appeared to have put the matter from his mind. Harry awaited an invitation to one of his little evening parties, determined to accept this time, even if he had to reschedule Quidditch prac- tice. Unfortunately, however, no such invitation arrived. Harry checked with Hermione and Ginny: neither of them had received an invitation and nor, as far as they knew, had anybody else. Harry could not help wondering whether this meant that Slughorn was not quite as forgetful as he appeared, simply determined to give Harry no additional opportunities to question him. Meanwhile, the Hogwarts library had failed Hermione for the first lime in living memory. She was so shocked, she even forgot that she was annoyed at Harry for his trick with the bezoar, 'I haven't found one single explanation of what Horcruxes do!\" she told him. 'Not a single one! I've been right through the restricted section and even in the most horrible books, where they tell you how to brew the most gruesome potions -nothing! All I could find was this, in the introduciion to Magick Mostc Evilc -- listen -- \"of the Horcrux, wickedest of magical inventions, we shall not speak nor give direction\" ... 1 mean, why mention it, then?' she said impatiently, slamming the old book shut; it let out a ghostly wail. 'Oh, shut up,' she snapped, stuffing it back into her bag. 'I asked whether you know anything about Horcruxes, sir. You see - 'Dumbledore put you up to this,' whispered Slughorn, His voice had changed completely. It was not genial any more, but shocked, terrified.

The snow melted around the school as February arrived, to be replaced by cold, dreary wetness. Purplish-grey clouds hung low over the castle and a constant fall of chilly rain made the lawns slippery and muddy. The upshot of this was that the sixth-years' first Apparition lesson, which was sched-uled for a Saturday morning so that no normal lessons would be missed, took place in the Great Hall instead of in the grounds. When Harry and Hermione arrived in the Hall (Ron had come down with Lavender) they found that the tables had disappeared. Rain lashed against the high windows and the enchanted ceiling swirled darkly above them as they assembled in front of Professors McGonagall, Snape, Flitwick and Sprout - the Heads of House - and a small wizard whom Harry took to be the Apparition Instructor from the Ministry. He was oddly colourless, with transparent eyelashes, wispy hair and an insubstantial air, as though a single gust of wind might blow him away. Harry wondered whether constant dis-appearances and reappearances had somehow diminished his substance, or whether this frail build was ideal for anyone wishing to vanish. 'Good morning,' said the Ministry wizard, when all the stu-dents had arrived and the Heads of House had called for quiet. 'My name is Wilkie Twycross and I shall be your Ministry-Apparition Instructor for the next twelve weeks. 1 hope to be able to prepare you for your Apparition test in this time -' 'Malfoy, be quiet and pay attention!' barked Professor McGonagall. Everybody looked round. Malfoy had flushed a dull pink; he looked furious as he stepped away from Crabbe, with whom he appeared to have been having a whispered argu-ment. Harry glanced quickly at Snape, who also looked annoyed, though Harry strongly suspected that this was less because of Malfoy's rudeness than the fact that McGonagall had reprimanded one of his house. '- by which time, many of you may be ready to take your test,' Twycross continued, as though there had been no interruption. 'As you may know, it is usually impossible to Apparate or Disapparate within Hogwarts. The Headmaster has lifted this enchantment, purely within the Great Hall, for one hour, so as to enable you to practise. May I emphasise that you will not be able to Apparate outside the walls of this Hall, and that you would be unwise to try. 'I would like each of you to place yourselves now so that you have a clear five feet of space in front of you.' There was a great scrambiing and jostling as people separ-ated, banged into each other, and ordered others out of their space. The Heads of House moved among the students, marshalling them into position and breaking up arguments. 'Harry, where are you going? 1 demanded Hermione. But Harry did not answer; he was moving quickly through the crowd, past the place where Professor Flitwick was making squeaky attempts to position a few Ravenclaws, all of whom wanted to be near the front, past Professor Sprout, who was chivvying the Hufflepuffs into line, until, by dodging around Ernie Macmillan, he managed to position himself right at the back of the crowd, directly behind Malfoy, who was taking advantage of the general upheaval to continue his argument with Crabbe, standing five feet away and looking mutinous. 'I don't know how much longer, all right?' Malfoy shot at him, oblivious to Harry standing right behind him. 'It's taking longer than I thought it would.' Crabbe opened his mouth, but Malfoy appeared to second-guess what he was going to say. 'Look, it's none of your business what I'm doing, Crabbe, you and Goyle just do as you're told and keep a lookout!' '! tell my friends what I'm up to, if I want them to keep a lookout for me,\" Harry said, just loud enough for Malfoy to hear him. Malfoy spun round on the spot, his hand flying to his wand, but at thai precise moment the four Heads of House shouted, 'Quiet!' and silence fell again. Malfoy turned slowly to face the front. Thank you,' said Twycross. :Now then ...' He waved his wand. Old-fashioned wooden hoops instantly appeared on the floor in from of every student. The important things to remember when Apparating are the three Ds!' said Twycross. 'Destination, Determination, Deliberation! 'Step one: fix your mind firmly upon the desired destin-ation,' said Twycross. 'In this case, the interior of your hoop. Kindly concentrate upon that destination now.' Everybody looked around furtively, to check that everyone else was staring into their hoop, then hastily did as they were told. Harry gazed at the circular patch of dusty floor enclosed by his hoop and tried hard to think of nothing else. This proved impossible, as he couldn't stop puzzling over what Malfoy was doing that needed lookouts. \"Step two,' said Twycross, 'focus your determination to occupy the visualised space! Let your yearning to enter it flood from your mind to every particle of your body!' Harry glanced around surreptitiously. A little way to his left, Ernie Macmillan was contemplating his hoop so hard that his face had turned pink; it looked as though he was straining to lay a Quaffle-sized egg. Harry bit back a laugh and hastily returned his gaze to his own hoop. 'Step three,' called Twycross, 'and only when 1 give the com-mand ... lum on the spot, feeiing your way into nothingness, moving with deliberation 1. On my command, now ... one- 1 Harry glanced around again; lots of people were looking positively alarmed at being asked to Apparate so quickly. Harry tried to fix his thoughts on his hoop again; he had already forgotten what the three Ds stood for. : - THREE!' Harry spun on the spot, lost his balance and nearly fell over. He was not the only one. The whole Hall was suddenly full of staggering people; Neville was flat on his back; Ernie Macmillan, on the other hand, had done a kind of pirouet-ting leap into his hoop and looked momentarily thrilled, until he caught sight of Dean Thomas roaring with laughter at him. 'Never mind, never mind,' said Twycross dryly, who did not seem to have expected anything better. 'Adjust your hoops, please, and back to your original positions ...' The second atlem.pt was no better than the first. The third was just as bad. Not until the fourth did anything exciting happen. There was a horrible screech of pain and everybody looked around, terrified, to see Susan Bones of Hufflepuff wobbling in her hoop with her left leg still standing five feet away where she had started. The Heads of House converged on her; there was a great bang and a puff of purple smoke, which cleared to reveal Susan sobbing, reunited with her leg but looking horrified. 'Sph'nching, or the separation of random body parts,' said Wilkie Twycross dispassionately, 'occurs when the mind is insufficiently determined. You must concentrate continually upon your destination, and move, without hasie, but with deliberation ... thus.' Twycross stepped forwards, turned gracefully on the spot with his arms outstretched and vanished in a swirl of robes, reappearing at the back of the Hall. 'Remember the three Ds,' he said, 'and try again ... one -two - three -' But an hour later, Susan's Splinching was still ihe most interesting thing that had happened. Twycross did not seem discouraged. Fastening his cloak at his neck, he merely said, 'Until next Saturday, everybody, and do not forget: Destin-ation. Determination. Deliberation.' With that, he waved his wand, Vanishing the hoops, and walked out of the Hall accompanied by Professor McGonagall. Talk broke out at once as people began moving towards the Entrance Hall. 'How did you do?' asked Ron, hurrying towards Harry. '1 think 1 felt something the last time I tried - a kind of tingling in my feet.' '1 expect your trainers are too small, Won-Won,' said a voice behind them, and Hermione stalked past, smirking. '1 didn't feel anything,' said Harry, ignoring this inter-ruption. \"But 1 don't care about that now-' 'What d'you mean, you don't care ... don't you want to leam to Apparate?' said Ron incredulously. 'I'm not fussed, really. I prefer flying,' said Harry, glancing over his shoulder to see where Malfoy was, and speeding up as they came into the Entrance Hall. 'Look, hurry up, will you, there's something I want to do ...' Perplexed, Ron followed Harry back to Gryffindor Tower at a run. They were temporarily detained by Peeves, who had jammed a door on the fourth floor shut and was refusing to let anyone pass until they set fire to their own pants, but Harry and Ron simply turned back and took one of their trusted short cuts. Within five minutes, they were climbing through the portrait hole. 'Are you going to tell me what we're doing, then?' asked Ron, panting slightly. 'Up here,' said Harry, and he crossed the common room and led the way through the door to the boys' staircase. Their dormitory was, as Ham' had hoped, empty. He flung open his trunk and began to rummage in it, while Ron watched impatiently. 'Harry ...' 'Malfoy's using Crabbe and Goyle as lookouts. He was argu-ing with Crabbe just now. 1 want to know ... aha.' He had found it, a folded square of apparently blank parchment, which he now smoothed out and tapped with [he tip of his wand. 'I solemn!)' swear that I am up to no good ... or Malfoy is, At once, the Marauder's Map appeared on the parchment's surface. Here was a detailed plan of every one of the castle's floors and, moving around it, the tiny, labelled black dots that signified each of the castle's occupants. 'Help me find Malfoy,' said Harry urgently. He laid the map upon his bed and he and Ron leaned over it, searching. 'There!' said Ron, after a minute or so. 'He's in the Slytherin common room, look ... with Parkinson and Zabini and Crabbe and Goyle ...\" Harry looked down at the map, disappointed, but rallied almost at once. 'Well, I'm keeping an eye on him from now on,' he said firmly. 'And the moment 1 see him lurking somewhere with Crabbe and Goyle keeping watch outside, it'll be on with the old Invisibility Cloak and off to find out what he's-' He broke off as Neville entered the dormitory, bringing with him a strong smell of singed material, and began rum-maging in his trunk for a fresh pair of pants. Despite his determination 10 catch Malfoy out, Harry had no luck at all over the next couple of weeks. Although he consulted the map as often as he could, sometimes making unnecessary visits to the bathroom between lessons to search it, he did not once see Malfoy anywhere suspicious. Admit-tedly, he spotted Crabbe and Goyle moving around the castle on their own more often than usual, sometimes remaining stationary in deserted corridors, but at these times Malfoy was not only nowhere near them, but impossible to locate on the map at all. This was most mysterious. Harry toyed with the possibility that Malfoy was actually leaving the school grounds, but could not see how he could be doing it, given the very high leve! of security now operating within the castle. He could only suppose ihat he was missing Malfoy amongst the hundreds of tiny black dots upon the map. As for the fact that Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle appeared to be going their dif-ferent ways when they were usually inseparable, these things happened as people got older - Ron and Hermione, Harry reflected sadly, were living proof. February moved towards March with no change in the weather except that it became windy as well as wet. To general indignation, a sign went up on all common-room noticeboards that the next trip into Hogsmeade had been cancelled. Ron was furious. 'It was on my birthday!' he said, 'i was looking forward to that!' 'Not a big surprise, though, is it?' said Harry. 'Not after what happened to Katie.' She had still not returned from Si Mungo's. What was more, further disappearances had been reported in the Daily Prophet, including several relatives of students at Hogwarts. 'But now all I've got to look forward to is stupid Appar-ition!' said Ron grumpily. 'Big birthday treat ...' Three lessons on, Apparition was proving as difficult as ever, though a few more people had managed to Splinch themselves. Frustration was running high and there was a certain amount of ill-feeling towards Wilkie Twycross and his three Ds, which had inspired a number of nicknames for him, the politest of which were Dog-breath and Dung-head. 'Happy birthday, Ron,' said Harry, when they were woken on the first of March by Seamus and Dean leaving noisily for breakfast. 'Have a present.' He threw the package across on to Ron's bed, where it joined a small pile of them that must, Harry assumed, have been delivered by house-elves in the night. 'Cheers,' said Ron drowsily, and as he ripped off the paper Harry got out of bed, opened his own crunk and began rum-maging in it for the Marauder's Map, which he hid after every use. He turfed out half the contents of his trunk before he found it hiding beneath the rolled-up socks in which he was still keeping his bottle of lucky potion, Felix Felicis. 'Right,' he murmured, taking it back to bed with him, tap-ping it quietly and murmuring, 'I solemnly swear that I am up to no good,' so that Neville, who was passing the foot of his bed at the time, would not hear. 'Nice one, Harry!' said Ron enthusiastically, waving the new pair of Quidditch Keeper's gloves Harry had given him. 'No problem,' said Harry absent-mindedly, as he searched the Slytherin dormitory closely for Malfoy. 'Hey ... I don't think he's in his bed ...' Ron did not answer; he was too busy unwrapping presents, every now and then letting out an exclamation of pleasure. 'Seriously good haul this year!' he announced, holding up a heavy gold watch with odd symbols around the edge and tiny moving stars instead of hands. 'See what Mum and Dad got me? Blimey, I think I'll come of age next year too ... 'Cool,' muttered Harry, sparing the watch a glance before peering more closely at the map. Where was Malfoy? He did not seem to be at the Slytherin table in the Great Hall, eating breakfast ... he was nowhere near Snape, who was sitting in his study ... he wasn't in any of the bathrooms or in the hospital wing ... 'Want one? 1 said Ron thickly, holding out a box of Chocolate Cauldrons. 'No thanks,' said Harry, looking up. 'Malfoy's gone again!' 'Can't have done,' said Ron, stuffing a second Cauldron into his mouth as he slid out of bed to get dressed. 'Come on. if you don't hurry up you'll have to Apparate on an empty-stomach ... might make it easier, 1 suppose ...\" Ron looked thoughtfully ai the box of Chocolate Cauldrons, then shrugged and helped himself to a third. Harry tapped the map with his wand, muttered, 'Mischief managed,' though it hadn't been, and got dressed, thinking hard. There had to be an explanation for Malfoy's periodic disappearances, but he simply could not think what it could be. The best way of finding out would be to tail him, bur even with the Invisibility Cloak this was an impractical idea; he had lessons, Quidditch practice, homework and Apparition; he could not follow Malfoy around school all day wilhout his absence being remarked upon, 'Ready?' he said to Ron. He was halfway to the dormitory door when he realised that Ron had not moved, but was leaning on his bedpost, staring out of the rain-washed window with a strangely un-focused look on his face. 'Ron? Breakfast.' 'I'm not hungry,' Harry stared ai him. 'I thought you just said -?' -Well, all right, I'll come down with you,' sighed Ron, 'but I don't want to eat.' Harry scrutinised him suspiciously. 'You've just eaten half a box of Chocolate Cauldrons, haven't you?' 'It's not that,' Ron sighed again. 'You ... you wouldn't understand.' 'Fair enough,' said Harry, albeit puzzled, as he turned to open the door. 'Harry!' said Ron suddenly. 'What?' 'Harry, I can't stand it!' 'You can't stand what?' asked Harry, now starling to feel definitely alarmed. Ron was rather pale and looked as though he was about to be sick. 'I can't stop thinking about her!' said Ron hoarsely. Harry gaped at him. He had not expected this and was not sure he wanted to hear it. Friends they might be, but if Ron started calling Lavender 'Lav-Lav', he would have to pui his foot down. 'Why does that stop you having breakfast?' Harry asked, trying to inject a note of common sense into the proceedings. 'I don't think she knows I exist,' said Ron with a desperate gesture. 'She definitely knows you exist,' said Harry, bewildered. 'She keeps snogging you, doesn't she?' Ron blinked. 'Who are you talking about?' Who are you talking about?' said Harry, with an increasing sense that all reason had dropped out of the conversation. 'Romilda Vane,' said Ron softly, and his whole face seemed to illuminate as he said it, as though hit by a ray of purest sunlight. They stared at each other for almost a whole minute, before Harry said, 'This is a joke, right? You're joking.' T think ... Harry, 1 ihink I love her,' said Ron in a strangled voice. 'OK,' said Harry, walking up to Ron 10 get a better look at the glazed eyes and the pallid complexion, 'OK ... say that again with a straight face.' 'I love her,' repeated Ron breathlessly. 'Have you seen her hair, it's all black and shiny and silky ... and her eyes? Her big dark eyes? And her -' 'This is really funny and everything,' said Harry impatiently, 'but joke's over, all right? Drop it.' He turned to leave; he had got two steps towards the door when a crashing blow hit him on the right ear. Staggering, he looked round. Ron's fist was drawn right back, his face was contorted with rage; he was about to strike again. Harry reacted instinctively; his wand was out of his pocket and the incantation sprang to mind without conscious thought: Le\\icorpus! Ron yelled as his heel was wrenched upwards once more; he dangled helplessly, upside-down, his robes hanging off him. 'What was that for?' Harry bellowed. 'You insulted her, Harry! You said it was a joke!' shouted Ron, who was slowly turning purple in the face as all the blood rushed to his head. 'This is insane!' said Harry. 'What's got into -?' And then he saw the box lying open on Ron's bed and the truth hit him with the force of a stampeding troll. 'Where did you get those Chocolate Cauldrons?' 'They were a birthday present!' shouted Ron, revolving slowly in midair as he struggled to get free. '1 offered you one, didn't 1?' 'You just picked them up off the floor, didn't you?' 'They'd fallen off my bed, all right? Let me go!' 'They didn't fall off your bed, you prat, don't you under-stand? They were mine, 1 chucked them out of my trunk when 1 was looking for the map. They're the Chocolate Cauldrons Romilda gave me before Christmas and they're all spiked with love potion!' But only one word of this seemed to have registered with Ron. 'Romilda?' he repeated. 'Did you say Romilda? Harry - do you know her? Can you introduce me?' Harry stared at the dangling Ron, whose face now looked tremendously hopeful, and fought a strong desire to laugh. A part of him - the part closest to his throbbing right ear - was quite keen on the idea of letting Ron down and watching him run amok until the effects of the potion wore off ... but on the other hand, they were supposed to be friends, Ron had not been himself when he had attacked, and Harry- thought that he would deserve another punching if he permitted Ron to declare undying love for Romilda Vane. 'Yeah, I'll introduce you,' said Harry, thinking fast. 'I'm going to let you down now, OK?' He sent Ron crashing back to the floor (his ear did hurt quite a lot), but Ron simply bounded to his feet again, grinning. 'She'll be in Slughorn's office, 1 said Harry confidently, leading the way to the door. 'Why will she be in there?' asked Ron anxiously, hurrying to keep up. 'Oh, she has extra Potions lessons with him,' said Harry, inventing wildly. 'Maybe 1 could ask if 1 can have them with her?' said Ron eagerly. 'Great idea,' said Harry. Lavender was waiting beside the portrait hole, a complication Harry had not foreseen. 'You're lace, Won-Won!' she pouted. 'I've got you a birth-day-' 'Leave me alone,' said Ron impatiently, 'Harry's going to introduce me to Romilda Vane.' And without another word to her, he pushed his way oui of the portrait hole. Harry tried to make an apologetic face to Lavender, but it might have turned out simply amused, because she looked more offended than ever as the Fat Lady swung shut behind them. Harry had been slightly worried that Slughorn might be at breakfast, but he answered his office door at the first knock, wearing a green velvet dressing-gown and matching nightcap and looking rather bleary-eyed. 'Harry,' he mumbled. 'This is very early for a call ... I generally sleep late on a Saturday ...\" 'Professor, I'm really sorry to disturb you,' said Harry as quietly as possible, while Ron stood on tiptoe, attempting to see past Slughorn into his room, 'but my friend Ron's swallowed a love potion by mistake. You couldn't make him an antidote, could you? I'd take him to Madam Pomfrey, but we're not supposed to have anything from Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes and, you know ... awkward questions ...' Td have thought you could have whipped him up a remedy, Harry, an expert potioneer like you?' asked Slughorn. 'Er,' said Harry, somewhat distracted by the fact that Ron was now elbowing him in the ribs in an attempt to force his way into the room, 'well, I've never mixed an antidote for a love potion, sir, and by the time I get it right Ron might've done something serious -' Helpfully, Ron chose this moment to moan, 'I can't see her. Harry - is he hiding her?' 'Was this potion within date?' asked Slughorn, now eyeing Ron with professional interest. 'They can strengthen, you know, the longer they're kept.' That would explain a lot,' panted Harry, now positively wrestling with Ron to keep him from knocking Slughorn over. 'It's his birthday, Professor,' he added imploringly. 'Oh, all right, come in, then, come in,' said Slughorn, relenting. 'I've got the necessary here in my bag, it's not a difficult antidote ...' Ron burst through the door into Slughorn's overheated, crowded study, tripped over a tasselled footstool, regained his balance by seizing Harry around the neck and muttered, 'She didn't see that, did she?' 'She's not here yet,' said Harry, watching Slughorn opening his potion kit and adding a few pinches of this and that to a small crystal bottle. That's good,' said Ron fervently. 'How do I look?' 'Very handsome,' said Slughorn smoothly, handing Ron a glass of clear liquid. 'Now drink that up, it's a tonic for the nerves, keep you calm when she arrives, you know,' 'Brilliant,' said Ron eagerly, and he gulped the antidote down noisily. Harry and Slughorn watched him. For a moment, Ron beamed at them. Then, very slowly, his grin sagged and van-ished, to be replaced by an expression of utmost horror. 'Back to normal, then?' said Harry, grinning. Slughorn chuckled. Thanks a lot, Professor.' 'Don't mention it, m'boy, don't mention it,' said Slughorn, as Ron collapsed into a nearby armchair, looking devastated. 'Pick-me-up, that's what he needs,' Slughorn continued, now-bustling over to a table loaded with drinks. 'I've got Butter-beer, I've got wine, I've got one last bottle of this oak-matured mead ... hmm ... meant to give that to Dumbledore for Christmas ... ah well ...' he shrugged '... he can't miss what he's never had! Why don't we open it now and celebrate Mr Weasley's birthday? Nothing like a fine spirit to chase away the pangs of disappointed love ...' He chortled again and Harry joined in. This was the firsi time he had found himself almost alone with Slughorn since his disastrous first attempt to extract the true memory from him. Perhaps, if he could just keep Slughorn in a good mood ... perhaps if they got through enough of the oak-matured mead ... There you are, then,' said Slughorn, handing Harry and Ron a glass of mead each, before raising his own. 'Well, a very happy birthday, Ralph -' '- Ron -' whispered Harry. But Ron, who did not appear to be listening to the toast, had already thrown the mead into his mouth and swallowed it. There was one second, hardly more than a heartbeat, in which Harry knew there was something terribly wrong and Slughorn, it seemed, did not. '- and may you have many more - 'Ron!' Ron had dropped his glass; he half-rose from his chair and then crumpled, his extremities jerking uncontrollably. Foam was dribbling from his mouth and his eyes were bulging from their sockets. 'Professor!' Harry bellowed. 'Do something]' But Slughorn seemed paralysed by shock. Ron twitched and choked: his skin was turning blue. 'What - but -' spluttered Slughorn. Harry leapt over a low table and sprinted towards Slughorn's open potion kit, pulling out jars and pouches, while the terrible sound of Ron's gargling breath filled the room. Then he found it - the shrivelled kidney-like stone Slughorn had taken from him in Potions. He hurtled back to Ron's side, wrenched open his jaw and thrust the bezoar into his mouth. Ron gave a great shudder, a rattling gasp and his body became limp and still. \n",

            " THIRTY-SIX The Only One He Ever Feared \"He hasn’t gone!\" Harry yelled. He did not believe it; he would not believe it; still he fought Lupin with every bit of strength he had. Lupin did not understand; people hid behind that curtain; Harry had heard them whispering the first time he had entered the room. Sirius was hiding, simply lurking out of sight. \"SIRIUS!\" he bellowed. \"SIRIUS!\" \"He can’t come back, Harry,\" said Lupin, his voice breaking as he struggled to contain Harry. \"He can’t come back, because he’s d-\" \"HE - IS - NOT - DEAD!\" roared Harry. \"SIRIUS!\" There was movement going on around them, pointless bustling, the flashes of more spells. To Harry it was meaningless noise, the deflected curses flying past them did not matter, nothing mattered except that Lupin should stop pretending that Sirius - who was standing feet from them behind that old curtain - was not going to emerge at any moment, shaking back his dark hair and eager to re-enter the battle. Lupin dragged Harry away from the dais. Harry, still staring at the archway, was angry at Sirius now for keeping him waiting But some part of him realized, even as he fought to break free from Lupin, that Sirius had never kept him waiting before... Sirius had risked everything, always, to see Harry, to help him... if Sirius was not reappearing out of that archway when Harry was yelling for him as though his life depended on it, the only possible explanation was that he could not come back... that he really was. Dumbledore had most of the remaining Death Eaters grouped in the middle of the room, seemingly immobilized by invisible ropes; Mad-Eye Moody had crawled across the room to where Tonks lay, and was attempting to revive her; behind the dais there were still hashes of light, grunts and cries - Kingsley had run forward to continue Sirius’s duel with Bellatrix. \"Harry?\" Neville had slid down the stone benches one by one to the place where Harry stood. Harry was no longer struggling against Lupin, who maintained a precautionary grip on his arm nevertheless. \"Harry... I’b really sorry...\" said Neville. His legs were still dancing uncontrollably. \"Was dad man - was Sirius Black a - a friend of yours?\" Harry nodded. \"Here,\" said Lupin quietly, and pointing his wand at Neville’s legs he said, \"Finite.\" The spell was lifted: Neville’s legs fell back to the floor and remained still. Lupin’s face was pale. \"Let’s - let’s find the others. Where are they all, Neville?\" Lupin turned away from the archway as he spoke. It sounded as though every word was causing him pain. \"Dey’re all back dere,\" said Neville. \"A brain addacked Ron bud I dink he’s all righd - and Herbione’s unconscious, bud we could feel a bulse\" There was a loud bang and a yell from behind the dais. Harry saw Kingsley hit the ground yelling in pain: Bellatrix Lestrange turned tail and ran as Dumbledore whipped around. He aimed a spell at her but she deflected it; she was halfway up the steps now \"Harry - no!\" cried Lupin, but Harry had already ripped his arm from Lupin’s slackened grip. \"SHE KILLED SIRIUS!\" bellowed Harry. \"SHE KILLED HIM I’LL KILL HER!\" And he was off, scrambling up the stone benches; people were shouting behind him but he did not care. The hem of Bellatrix’s robes whipped out of sight ahead and they were back in the room where the brains were swimming... She aimed a curse over her shoulder. The tank rose into the air and tipped. Harry was deluged in the foul-smelling potion within: the brains slipped and slid over him and began spinning their long colored tentacles, but he shouted, \"Wingardium Leviosa!\" and they flew off him up into the air. Slipping and sliding, he ran on towards the door; he leapt over Luna, who was groaning on the floor, past Ginny, who said, \"Harry - what -?\", past Ron, who giggled feebly, and Hermione, who was still unconscious. He wrenched open the door into the circular black hall and saw Bellatrix disappearing through a door on the other side of the room; beyond her was the corridor leading back to the lifts. He ran, but she had slammed the door behind her and the walls were already rotating. Once more, he was surrounded by streaks of blue light from the whirling candelabra. \"Where’s the exit?\" he shouted desperately, as the wall rumbled to a halt again. \"Where’s the way out?\" The room seemed to have been waiting for him to ask. The door right behind him flew open and the corridor towards the lifts stretched ahead of him, torch-lit and empty. He ran... He could hear a lift clattering ahead; he sprinted up the passageway, swung around the corner and slammed his fist on to the button to call a second lift. It jangled and banged lower and lower; the grilles slid open and Harry dashed inside, now hammering the button marked ‘Atrium’. The doors slid shut and he was rising... He forced his way out of the lift before the grilles were fully open and looked around. Bellatrix was almost at the telephone lift at the other end of the hall, but she looked back as he sprinted towards her and aimed another spell at him. He dodged behind the Fountain of Magical Brethren: the spell zoomed past him and hit the wrought gold gates at the other end of the Atrium so that they rang like bells. There were no more footsteps. She had stopped running. He crouched behind the statues, listening. \"Come out, come out, little Harry!\" she called in her mock baby voice, which echoed off the polished wooden floors. \"What did you come after me for, then? I thought you were here to avenge my dear cousin!\" \"I am!\" shouted Harry, and a score of ghostly Harrys seemed to chorus I am! I am! I am! all around the room \"Aaaaaah... did you love him, little baby Potter?\" Hatred rose in Harry such as he had never known before; he flung himself out from behind the fountain and bellowed, \"Crucio!\" Bellatrix screamed: the spell had knocked her off her feet, but she did not writhe and shriek with pain as Neville had - she was already back on her feet, breathless, no longer laughing. Harry dodged behind the golden fountain again. Her counter-spell hit the head of the handsome wizard, which was blown off and landed twenty feet away, gouging long scratches into the wooden floor. \"Never used an Unforgivable Curse before, have you, boy?\" she yelled. She had abandoned her baby voice now. \"You need to mean them, Potter! You need to really want to cause pain - to enjoy it - righteous anger won’t hurt me for long - I’ll show you how it is done, shall I? I’ll give you a lesson -\" Harry was edging around the fountain on the other side when she screamed, \"Crucio!\" and he was forced to duck down again as the centaur’s arm, holding its bow, span off and landed with a crash on the floor a short distance from the golden wizard’s head. \"Potter, you cannot win against me!\" she cried. He could hear her moving to the right, trying to get a clear shot of him. He backed around the statue away from her, crouching behind the centaur’s legs, his head level with the house-elf’s. \"I was and am the Dark Lord’s most loyal servant. I learned the Dark Arts from him, and I know spells of such power that you, pathetic little boy, can never hope to compete\" \"Stupefy!\" yelled Harry. He had edged right around to where the goblin stood beaming up at the now headless wizard and taken aim at her back as she peered around the fountain. She reacted so fast he barely had time to duck. \"Protego!\" The jet of red light, his own Stunning Spell, bounced back at him. Harry scrambled back behind the fountain and one of the goblin’s ears went flying across the room. \"Potter, I’m going to give you one chance!\" shouted Bellatrix. \"Give me the prophecy - roll it out towards me now - and I may spare your life!\" \"Well, you’re going to have to kill me, because it’s gone!\" Harry roared and, as he shouted it, pain seared across his forehead; his scar was on fire again, and he felt a surge of fury that was quite unconnected with his own rage. \"And he knows!’\" said Harry, with a mad laugh to match Bellatrix’s own. \"Your dear old mate Voldemort knows it’s gone! He’s not going to be happy with you, is he?\" \"What? What do you mean?\" she cried, and for the first time there was fear in her voice. \"The prophecy smashed when I was trying to get Neville up the steps! What do you think Voldemort’ll say about that, then?\" His scar seared and burned... the pain of it was making his eyes stream... \"LIAR!\" she shrieked, but he could hear the terror behind the anger now. \"YOU’VE GOT IT, POTTER, AND YOU WILL GIVE IT TO ME! Accio prophecy! ACCIO PROPHECY!\" Harry laughed again because he knew it would incense her, the pain building in his head so badly he thought his skull might burst. He waved his empty hand from behind the one-eared goblin and withdrew it quickly as she sent another jet of green light flying at him. \"Nothing there!\" he shouted. \"Nothing to summon! It smashed and nobody heard what it said, tell your boss that!\" \"No!\" she screamed. \"It isn’t true, you’re lying! MASTER, I TRIED, I TRIED - DO NOT PUNISH ME\" \"Don’t waste your breath!\" yelled Harry, his eyes screwed up against the pain in his scar, now more terrible than ever. \"He can’t hear you from here!\" \"Can’t I, Potter?\" said a high, cold voice. Harry opened his eyes. Tall, thin and black-hooded, his terrible snakelike face white and gaunt, his scarlet, slit-pupilled eyes staring... Lord Voldemort had appeared in the middle of the hall, his wand pointing at Harry who stood frozen, quite unable to move. \"So, you smashed my prophecy?\" said Voldemort softly, staring at Harry with those pitiless red eyes. \"No, Bella, he is not lying... I see the truth looking at me from within his worthless mind... months of preparation, months of effort... and my Death Eaters have let Harry Potter thwart me again\" \"Master, I am sorry I knew not, I was fighting the Animagus Black!\" sobbed Bellatrix, flinging herself down at Voldemort’s feet as he paced slowly nearer. \"Master, you should know\" \"Be quiet, Bella,\" said Voldemort dangerously. \"I shall deal with you in a moment. Do you think I have entered the Ministry of Magic to hear your sniveling apologies?\" \"But Master - he is here - he is below\" Voldemort paid no attention. \"I have nothing more to say to you, Potter,\" he said quietly. \"You have irked me too often, for too long. AVADA KEDAVRA!\" Harry had not even opened his mouth to resist; his mind was blank, his wand pointing uselessly at the floor. But the headless golden statue of the wizard in the fountain had sprung alive, leaping from its plinth to land with a crash on the floor between Harry and Voldemort. The spell merely glanced off its chest as the statue flung out its arms to protect Harry. \"What -?\" cried Voldemort, staring around. And then he breathed, \"Dumbledore!\" Harry looked behind him, his heart pounding. Dumbledore was standing in front of the golden gates. Voldemort raised his wand and another jet of green light streaked at Dumbledore, who turned and was gone in a whirling of his cloak. Next second, he had reappeared behind Voldemort and waved his wand towards the remnants of the fountain. The other statues sprang to life. The statue of the witch ran at Bellatrix, who screamed and sent spells streaming uselessly off its chest, before it dived at her, pinning her to the floor. Meanwhile, the goblin and the house-elf scuttled towards the fireplaces set along the wall and the one-armed centaur galloped at Voldemort, who vanished and reappeared beside the pool. The headless statue thrust Harry backwards, away from the fight, as Dumbledore advanced on Voldemort and the golden centaur cantered around them both. \"It was foolish to come here tonight, Tom,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"The Aurors are on their way\" \"By which time I shall be gone, and you will be dead!\" spat Voldemort. He sent another killing curse at Dumbledore but missed, instead hitting the security guard’s desk, which burst into flame. Dumbledore flicked his own wand: the force of the spell that emanated from it was such that Harry, though shielded by his golden guard, felt his hair stand on end as it passed and this time Voldemort was forced to conjure a shining silver shield out of thin air to deflect it. The spell, whatever it was, caused no visible damage to the shield, though a deep, gong-like note reverberated from it - an oddly chilling sound. \"You do not seek to kill me, Dumbledore?\" called Voldemort, his scarlet eyes narrowed over the top of the shield. \"Above such brutality, are you?\" \"We both know that there are other ways of destroying a man, Tom,\" Dumbledore said calmly, continuing to walk towards Voldemort as though he had not a fear in the world, as though nothing had happened to interrupt his stroll up the hall. \"Merely taking your life would not satisfy me, I admit\" \"There is nothing worse than death, Dumbledore!\" snarled Voldemort. \"You are quite wrong,\" said Dumbledore, still closing in upon Voldemort and speaking as lightly as though they were discussing the matter over drinks. Harry felt scared to see him walking along, undefended, shieldless; he wanted to cry out a warning, but his headless guard kept shunting him backwards towards the wall, blocking his every attempt to get out from behind it. \"Indeed, your failure to understand that there are things much worse than death has always been your greatest weakness\" Another jet of green light flew from behind the silver shield. This time it was the one-armed centaur, galloping in front of Dumbledore, that took the blast and shattered into a hundred pieces, but before the fragments had even hit the floor, Dumbledore had drawn back his wand and waved it as though brandishing a whip. A long thin flame flew from the tip; it wrapped itself around Voldemort, shield and all. For a moment, it seemed Dumbledore had won, but then the fiery rope became a serpent, which relinquished its hold on Voldemort at once and turned, hissing furiously, to face Dumbledore. Voldemort vanished; the snake reared from the floor, ready to strike. There was a burst of flame in midair above Dumbledore just as Voldemort reappeared, standing on the plinth in the middle of the pool where so recently the five statues had stood. \"Look out!\" Harry yelled. But even as he shouted, another jet of green light flew at Dumbledore from Voldemort’s wand and the snake had struck. Fawkes swooped down in front of Dumbledore, opened his beak wide and swallowed the jet of green light whole: he burst into flame and fell to the floor, small, wrinkled and flightless. At the same moment, Dumbledore brandished his wand in one long, fluid movement - the snake, which had been an instant from sinking its fangs into him, flew high into the air and vanished in a wisp of dark smoke; and the water in the pool rose up and covered Voldemort like a cocoon of molten glass. For a few seconds Voldemort was visible only as a dark, rippling, faceless figure, shimmering and indistinct upon the plinth, clearly struggling to throw off the suffocating mass. Then he was gone and the water fell with a crash back into its pool, slopping wildly over the sides, drenching the polished floor. \"MASTER!\" screamed Bellatrix. Sure it was over, sure Voldemort had decided to flee, Harry made to run out from behind his statue guard, but Dumbledore bellowed: \"Stay where you are, Harry!\" For the first time, Dumbledore sounded frightened. Harry could not see why: the hall was quite empty but for themselves, the sobbing Bellatrix still trapped under the witch statue, and the baby phoenix Fawkes croaking feebly on the floor And then Harry's scar burst open and he knew he was dead: it was pain beyond imagining, pain past endurance. He was gone from the hall, he was locked in the coils of a creature with red eyes, so tightly bound that Harry did not know where his body ended and the creature’s began: they were fused together, bound by pain, and there was no escape And when the creature spoke, it used Harry’s mouth, so that in his agony he felt his jaw move \"Kill me now, Dumbledore...\" Blinded and dying, every part of him screaming for release, Harry felt the creature use him again... \"If death is nothing, Dumbledore, kill the boy...\" Let the pain stop, thought Harry... let him kill us... end it, Dumbledore... death is nothing compared to this... And I’ll see Sirius again... And as Harry’s heart filled with emotion, the creature’s coils loosened, the pain was gone; Harry was lying face down on the floor, his glasses gone, shivering as though he lay upon ice, not wood... And there were voices echoing through the hall, more voices than there should have been... Harry opened his eyes, saw his glasses lying by the heel of the headless statue that had been guarding him, but which now lay flat on its back, cracked and immobile. He put them on and raised his head a little to find Dumbledore’s crooked nose inches from his own. \"Are you all right, Harry?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry, shaking so violently he could not hold his head up properly. \"Yeah, I’m - where’s Voldemort, where - who are all these - what’s -\" The Atrium was full of people; the floor was reflecting the emerald green flames that had burst into life in all the fireplaces along one wall; and streams of witches and wizards were emerging from them. As Dumbledore pulled him back to his feet, Harry saw the tiny gold statues of the house-elf and the goblin, leading a stunned-looking Cornelius Fudge forward. \"He was there!\" shouted a scarlet-robed man with a ponytail, who was pointing at a pile of golden rubble on the other side of the hall, where Bellatrix had lain trapped only moments before. \"I saw him, Mr. Fudge, I swear it was You-Know-Who, he grabbed a woman and Disapparated!\" \"I know, Williamson, I know, I saw him too!\" gibbered Fudge, who was wearing pajamas under his pinstriped cloak and was gasping as though he had just run miles. \"Merlin’s beard - here - here! - in the Ministry of Magic! - great heavens above - it doesn’t seem possible - my word - how can this be -?\" \"If you proceed downstairs into the Department of Mysteries, Cornelius,\" said Dumbledore - apparently satisfied that Harry was all right, and walking forwards so that the newcomers realized he was there for the first time (a few of them raised their wands; others simply looked amazed; the statues of the elf and goblin applauded and Fudge jumped so much that his slipperclad feet left the floor) - \"you will find several escaped Death Eaters contained in the Death Chamber, bound by an Anti-Disapparation Jinx and awaiting your decision as to what to do with them.\" \"Dumbledore!\" gasped Fudge, beside himself with amazement. \"You-here-I-I\" He looked wildly around at the Aurors he had brought with him and it could not have been clearer that he was in half a mind to cry, \"Seize him!\" \"Cornelius, I am ready to fight your men - and win, again!\" said Dumbledore in a thunderous voice. \"But a few minutes ago you saw proof, with your own eyes, that I have been telling you the truth for a year. Lord Voldemort has returned, you have been chasing the wrong man for twelve months, and it is time - you listened to sense!\" \"I - don’t - well\" blustered Fudge, looking around as though hoping somebody was going to tell him what to do. When nobody did, he said, \"Very well - Dawlish! Williamson! Go down to the Department of Mysteries and see... Dumbledore, you - you will need to tell me exactly - the Fountain of Magical Brethren - what happened?\" he added in a kind of whimper, staring around at the floor, where the remains of the statues of the witch, wizard and centaur now lay scattered. \"We can discuss that after I have sent Harry back to Hogwarts,\" said Dumbledore. \"Harry - Harry Potter?\" Fudge wheeled around and stared at Harry, who was still standing against the wall beside the fallen statue that had guarded him during Dumbledore and Voldemort’s duel. \"He - here?\" said Fudge, goggling at Harry. \"Why - what’s all this about?\" \"I shall explain everything,\" repeated Dumbledore, \"when Harry is back at school.\" He walked away from the pool to the place where the golden wizard’s head lay on the floor. He pointed his wand at it and muttered, \"Portus.\" The head glowed blue and trembled noisily against the wooden floor for a few seconds, then became still once more. \"Now see here, Dumbledore!\" said Fudge, as Dumbledore picked up the head and walked back to Harry carrying it. \"You haven’t got authorization for that Portkey! You can’t do things like that right in front of the Minister for Magic, you - you\" His voice faltered as Dumbledore surveyed him magisterially over his half-moon spectacles. \"You will give the order to remove Dolores Umbridge from Hogwarts,\" said Dumbledore. \"You will tell your Aurors to stop searching for my Care of Magical Creatures teacher so that he can return to work. I will give you...\" Dumbledore pulled a watch with twelve hands from his pocket and surveyed it... \"half an hour of my time tonight, in which I think we shall be more than able to cover the important points of what has happened here. After that, I shall need to return to my school. If you need more help from me you are, of course, more than welcome to contact me at Hogwarts. Letters addressed to the Headmaster will find me.\" Fudge goggled worse than ever; his mouth was open and his round face grew pinker under his rumpled grey hair. \"I - you\" Dumbledore turned his back on him. \"Take this Portkey, Harry.\" He held out the golden head of the statue and Harry placed his hand on it, past caring what he did next or where he went. \"I shall see you in half an hour,\" said Dumbledore quietly \"One... two... three...\" Harry felt the familiar sensation of a hook being jerked behind his navel. The polished wooden floor was gone from beneath his feet; the Atrium, Fudge and Dumbledore had all disappeared and he was flying forwards in a whirlwind of color and sound... \n",

            " THIRTYTHREE  THE DEATH EATERS Voldemort looked away from Harry and began examining his own body. His hands were like large, pale spiders; his long white fingers caressed his own chest, his arms, his face; the red eyes, whose pupils were slits, like a cats, gleamed still more brightly through the darkness. He held up his hands and flexed the fingers, his expression rapt and exultant. He took not the slightest notice of Wormtail, who lay twitching and bleeding on the ground, nor of the great snake, which had slithered back into sight and was circling Harry again, hissing. Voldemort slipped one of those unnaturally longfingered hands into a deep pocket and drew out a wand. He caressed it gently too; and then he raised it, and pointed it at Wormtail, who was lifted off the ground and thrown against the headstone where Harry was tied; he fell to the foot of it and lay there, crumpled up and crying. Voldemort turned his scarlet eyes upon Harry, laughing a high, cold, mirthless laugh. Wormtail's robes were shining with blood now; he had wrapped the stump of his arm in them. \"My Lord . . .\" he choked, \"my Lord . . . you promised . . . you did promise ...\" \"Hold out your arm,\" said Voldemort lazily. \"Oh Master . . . thank you, Master ...\" He extended the bleeding stump, but Voldemort laughed again. \"The other arm, Wormtail.\" \"Master, please . . .please ...\" Voldemort bent down and pulled out Wormtail's left arm; he forced the sleeve of Wormtail's robes up past his elbow, and Harry saw something upon the skin there, something like a vivid red tattoo  a skull with a snake protruding from its mouth  the image that had appeared in the sky at the Quidditch World Cup: the Dark Mark. Voldemort examined it carefully, ignoring Wormtail's uncontrollable weeping. \"It is back,\" he said softly, \"they will all have noticed it... and now, we shall see ... now we shall know ...\" He pressed his long white forefinger to the brand on Wormtail's arm. The scar on Harry s forehead seared with a sharp pain again, and Wormtail let out a fresh howl; Voldemort removed his fingers from Wormtail's mark, and Harry saw that it had turned jet black. A look of cruel satisfaction on his face, Voldemort straightened up, threw back his head, and stared around at the dark graveyard. \"How many will be brave enough to return when they feel it?\" he whispered, his gleaming red eyes fixed upon the stars. \"And how many will be foolish enough to stay away?\" He began to pace up and down before Harry and Wormtail, eyes sweeping the graveyard all the while. After a minute or so, he looked down at Harry again, a cruel smile twisting his snakelike face. \"You stand, Harry Potter, upon the remains of my late father,\" he hissed softly. \"A Muggle and a fool. . . very like your dear mother. But they both had their uses, did they not? Your mother died to defend you as a child . . . and I killed my father, and see how useful he has proved himself, in death. ...\" Voldemort laughed again. Up and down he paced, looking all around him as he walked, and the snake continued to circle in the grass. \"You see that house upon the hillside, Potter? My father lived there. My mother, a witch who lived here in this village, fell in love with him. But he abandoned her when she told him what she was. ... He didn't like magic, my father . . . \"He left her and returned to his Muggle parents before I was even born. Potter, and she died giving birth to me, leaving me to be raised in a Muggle orphanage . . . but I vowed to find him ... I revenged myself upon him, that fool who gave me his name . . . Tom Riddle. . . .\" Still he paced, his red eyes darting from grave to grave. \"Listen to me, reliving family history . . .\" he said quietly, \"why, I am growing quite sentimental. . . . But look, Harry! My true family returns. . . .\" The air was suddenly full of the swishing of cloaks. Between graves, behind the yew tree, in every shadowy space, wizards were Apparating. All of them were hooded and masked. And one by one they moved forward . . . slowly, cautiously, as though they could hardly believe their eyes Voldemort stood in silence, waiting for them. Then one of the Death Eaters fell to his knees, crawled toward Voldemort and kissed the hem of his black robes. Master . . . Master \" he murmured. The Death Eaters behind him did the same; each of them approaching Voldemort on his knees and kissing his robes, before backing away and standing up, forming a silent circle, which enclosed Tom Riddle s grave, Harry, Voldemort, and the sobbing and twitching heap that was Wormtail. Yet they left gaps in the circle, as though waiting for more people. Voldemort, however, did not seem to expect more. He looked around at the hooded faces, and though there was no wind rustling seemed to run around the circle, as though it had shivered. \"Welcome, Death Eaters,\" said Voldemort quietly. \"Thirteen years. . . thirteen years since last we met. Yet you answer my call as though it were yesterday, we are still united under the Dark Mark, then! Or are we?\" He put back his terrible face and sniffed, his slitlike nostrils widening. \"I smell guilt,\" he said. \"There is a stench or guilt upon the air. A second shiver ran around the circle, as though each member of it longed, but did not dare to step back from him. \"I see you all, whole and healthy, with your powers intact  such prompt appearances! and I ask myself . . . why did this band of wizards never come to the aid of their master, to whom they swore eternal loyalty?\" No one spoke. No one moved except Wormtail, who was upon the ground, still sobbing over his bleeding arm. \"And I answer myself,\" whispered Voldemort, \"they must have believed me broken, they thought I was gone. They slipped back among my enemies, and they pleaded innocence, and ignorance, and bewitchment. . . . \"And then I ask myself, but how could they have believed I would not rise again! They, who knew the steps I took, long ago, to guard myself against mortal death! They, who had seen proofs of the immensity of my power in the times when I was mightier than any wizard living! \"And I answer myself, perhaps they believed a still greater power could exist, one that could vanquish even Lord Voldemort. . . perhaps they now pay allegiance to another . . . perhaps that champion of commoners, of Mudbloods and Muggles, Albus Dumbledore?\" At the mention of Dumbledore's name, the members of the circle stirred, and some muttered and shook their heads. Voldemort ignored them. \"It is a disappointment to me ... I confess myself disappointed. . . .\" One of the men suddenly flung himself forward, breaking the circle. Trembling from head to foot, he collapsed at Voldemort's feet. \"Master!\" he shrieked, \"Master, forgive me! Forgive us all!\" Voldemort began to laugh. He raised his wand. \"Crucio!\" The Death Eater on the ground writhed and shrieked; Harry was sure the sound must carry to the houses around. . . . Let the police come, he thought desperately . . . anyone . .. anything. . . Voldemort raised his wand. The tortured Death Eater lay flat upon the ground, gasping. \"Get up, Avery,\" said Voldemort softly. \"Stand up. You ask for forgiveness? I do not forgive. I do not forget. Thirteen long years ... I want thirteen years' repayment before I forgive you. Wormtail here has paid some of his debt already, have you not, Wormtail?\" He looked down at Wormtail, who continued to sob. \"You returned to me, not out of loyalty, but out of fear of your old friends. You deserve this pain, Wormtail. You know that, don't you?\" \"Yes, Master,\" moaned Wormtail, \"please. Master . . . please ...\" \"Yet you helped return me to my body,\" said Voldemort coolly, watching Wormtail sob on the ground. \"Worthless and traitorous as you are, you helped me ... and Lord Voldemort rewards his helpers... .\" Voldemort raised his wand again and whirled it through the air. A streak of what looked like molten silver hung shining in the wand's wake. Momentarily shapeless, it writhed and then formed itself into a gleaming replica of a human hand, bright as moonlight, which soared downward and fixed itself upon Wormtails bleeding wrist. Wormtail's sobbing stopped abruptly. His breathing harsh and ragged, he raised his head and stared in disbelief at the silver hand, now attached seamlessly to his arm, as though he were wearing a dazzling glove. He flexed the shining fingers, then, trembling, picked up a small twig on the ground and crushed it into powder. \"My Lord,\" he whispered. \"Master ... it is beautiful. . . thank you... thank you. ...\" He scrambled forward on his knees and kissed the hem of Voldemort's robes. \"May your loyalty never waver again, Wormtail,\" said Voldemort. \"No, my Lord . . . never, my Lord . . .\" Wormtail stood up and took his place in the circle, staring at his powerful new hand, his face still shining with tears. Voldemort now approached the man on Wormtail's right. \"Lucius, my slippery friend,\" he whispered, halting before him. \"I am told that you have not renounced the old ways, though to the world you present a respectable face. You are still ready to take the lead in a spot of Muggletorture, I believe? Yet you never tried to find me, Lucius. . . . Your exploits at the Quidditch World Cup were fun, I daresay. . . but might not your energies have been better directed toward finding and aiding your master?\" \"My Lord, I was constantly on the alert,\" came Lucius Malfoy's voice swiftly from beneath the hood. \"Had there been any sign from you, any whisper of your whereabouts, I would have been at your side immediately, nothing could have prevented me \" \"And yet you ran from my Mark, when a faithful Death Eater sent it into the sky last summer?\" said Voldemort lazily, and Mr. Malfoy stopped talking abruptly. \"Yes, I know all about that, Lucius. . . . You have disappointed me. ... I expect more faithful service in the future.\" \"Of course, my Lord, of course. . . . You are merciful, thank you. ...\" Voldemort moved on, and stopped, staring at the space  large enough for two people  that separated Malfoy and the next man. \"The Lestranges should stand here,\" said Voldemort quietly. \"But they are entombed in Azkaban. They were faithful. They went to Azkaban rather than renounce me. . . . When Azkaban is broken open, the Lestranges will be honored beyond their dreams. The dementors will join us ... they are our natural allies ... we will recall the banished giants ... I shall have all my devoted servants returned to me, and an army of creatures whom all fear. ...\" He walked on. Some of the Death Eaters he passed in silence, but he paused before others and spoke to them. \"Macnair . . . destroying dangerous beasts for the Ministry of Magic now, Wormtail tells me? You shall have better victims than that soon, Macnair. Lord Voldemort will provide. ...\" \"Thank you, Master . . . thank you,\" murmured Macnair. \"And here\"  Voldemort moved on to the two largest hooded figures  \"we have Crabbe . . . you will do better this time, will you not, Crabbe? And you, Goyle?\" They bowed clumsily, muttering dully. \"Yes, Master ...\" \"We will, Master....\" \"The same goes for you, Nott,\" said Voldemort quietly as he walked past a stooped figure in Mr. Goyles shadow. \"My Lord, I prostrate myself before you, I am your most faithful \" \"That will do,\" said Voldemort. He had reached the largest gap of all, and he stood surveying it with his blank, red eyes, as though he could see people standing there. \"And here we have six missing Death Eaters . . . three dead in my service. One, too cowardly to return ... he will pay. One, who I believe has left me forever ... he will be killed, of course . . . and one, who remains my most faithful servant, and who has already reentered my service.\" The Death Eaters stirred, and Harry saw their eyes dart sideways at one another through their masks. \"He is at Hogwarts, that faithful servant, and it was through his efforts that our young friend arrived here tonight. . . . \"Yes,\" said Voldemort, a grin curling his lipless mouth as the eyes of the circle flashed in Harry's direction. \"Harry Potter has kindly joined us for my rebirthing party. One might go so far as to call him my guest of honor.\" There was a silence. Then the Death Eater to the right of Wormtail stepped forward, and Lucius Malfoy's voice spoke from under the mask. \"Master, we crave to know ... we beg you to tell us ... how you have achieved this . . . this miracle . . . how you managed to return to us. .. .\" \"Ah, what a story it is, Lucius,\" said Voldemort. \"And it begins  and ends  with my young friend here.\" He walked lazily over to stand next to Harry, so that the eyes of the whole circle were upon the two of them. The snake continued to circle. \"You know, of course, that they have called this boy my downfall?\" Voldemort said softly, his red eyes upon Harry, whose scar began to burn so fiercely that he almost screamed in agony. \"You all know that on the night I lost my powers and my body, I tried to kill him. His mother died in the attempt to save him  and unwittingly provided him with a protection I admit I had not foreseen. ... I could not touch the boy.\" Voldemort raised one of his long white fingers and put it very close to Harry's cheek. \"His mother left upon him the traces other sacrifice. . . . This is old magic, I should have remembered it, I was foolish to overlook it... but no matter. I can touch him now.\" Harry felt the cold tip of the long white finger touch him, and thought his head would burst with the pain. Voldemort laughed softly in his ear, then took the finger away and continued addressing the Death Eaters. \"I miscalculated, my friends, I admit it. My curse was deflected by the woman's foolish sacrifice, and it rebounded upon myself. Aaah . . . pain beyond pain, my friends; nothing could have prepared me for it. I was ripped from my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost. . . but still, I was alive. What I was, even I do not know... I, who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality. You know my goal  to conquer death. And now, I was tested, and it appeared that one or more of my experiments had worked ... for I had not been killed, though the curse should have done it. Nevertheless, I was as powerless as the weakest creature alive, and without the means to help myself... for I had no body, and every spell that might have helped me required the use of a wand. . . . \"I remember only forcing myself, sleeplessly, endlessly, second by second, to exist. ... I settled in a faraway place, in a forest, and I waited. . . . Surely, one of my faithful Death Eaters would try and find me. . . one of them would come and perform the magic I could not, to restore me to a body . . , but I waited in vain. ...\" The shiver ran once more around the circle of listening Death Eaters. Voldemort let the silence spiral horribly before continuing. \"Only one power remained to me. I could possess the bodies of others. But I dared not go where other humans were plentiful, for I knew that the Aurors were still abroad and searching for me. I sometimes inhabited animals  snakes, of course, being my preference  but I was little better off inside them than as pure spirit, for their bodies were ill adapted to perform magic . . . and my possession of them shortened their lives; none of them lasted long. . . . \"Then . . . four years ago . . . the means for my return seemed assured. A wizard  young, foolish, and gullible  wandered across my path in the forest I had made my home. Oh, he seemed the very chance I had been dreaming of... for he was a teacher at Dumbledore's school... he was easy to bend to my will... he brought me back to this country, and after a while, I took possession of his body, to supervise him closely as he carried out my orders. But my plan failed. I did not manage to steal the Sorcerer's Stone. I was not to be assured immortal life. I was thwarted . . . thwarted, once again, by Harry Potter. ...\" Silence once more; nothing was stirring, not even the leaves on the yew tree. The Death Eaters were quite motionless, the glittering eyes in their masks fixed upon Voldemort, and upon Harry. \"The servant died when I left his body, and I was left as weak as ever I had been,\" Voldemort continued. \"I returned to my hiding place far away, and I will not pretend to you that I didn't then fear that I might never regain my powers. . . . Yes, that was perhaps my darkest hour... I could not hope that I would be sent another wizard to possess . . . and I had given up hope, now, that any of my Death Eaters cared what had become of me. ...\" One or two of the masked wizards in the circle moved uncomfortably, but Voldemort took no notice. \"And then, not even a year ago, when I had almost abandoned hope, it happened at last... a servant returned to me. Wormtail here, who had faked his own death to escape justice, was driven out of hiding by those he had once counted friends, and decided to return to his master. He sought me in the country where it had long been rumored I was hiding . . . helped, of course, by the rats he met along the way. Wormtail has a curious affinity with rats, do you not, Wormtail? His filthy little friends told him there was a place, deep in an Albanian forest, that they avoided, where small animals like themselves had met their deaths by a dark shadow that possessed them. . . . \"But his journey back to me was not smooth, was it, Wormtail? For, hungry one night, on the edge of the very forest where he had hoped to find me, he foolishly stopped at an inn for some food . . . and who should he meet there, but one Bertha Jorkins, a witch from the Ministry of Magic. \"Now see the way that fate favors Lord Voldemort. This might have been the end of Wormtail, and of my last hope for regeneration. But Wormtail  displaying a presence of mind I would never have expected from him  convinced Bertha Jorkins to accompany him on a nighttime stroll. He overpowered her ... he brought her to me. And Bertha Jorkins, who might have ruined all, proved instead to be a gift beyond my wildest dreams ... for  with a little persuasion  she became a veritable mine of information. \"She told me that the Triwizard Tournament would be played at Hogwarts this year. She told me that she knew of a faithful Death Eater who would be only too willing to help me, if I could only contact him. She told me many things. . . but the means I used to break the Memory Charm upon her were powerful, and when I had extracted all useful information from her, her mind and body were both damaged beyond repair. She had now served her purpose. I could not possess her. I disposed of her.\" Voldemort smiled his terrible smile, his red eyes blank and pitiless. \"Wormtail's body, of course, was ill adapted for possession, as all assumed him dead, and would attract far too much attention if noticed. However, he was the ablebodied servant I needed, and, poor wizard though he is, Wormtail was able to follow the instructions I gave him, which would return me to a rudimentary, weak body of my own, a body I would be able to inhabit while awaiting the essential ingredients for true rebirth ... a spell or two of my own invention ... a little help from my dear Nagini,\" Voldemorts red eyes fell upon the continually circling snake, \"a potion concocted from unicorn blood, and the snake venom Nagini provided ... I was soon returned to an almost human form, and strong enough to travel. \"There was no hope of stealing the Sorcerer's Stone anymore, for I knew that Dumbledore would have seen to it that it was destroyed. But I was willing to embrace mortal life again, before chasing immortality. I set my sights lower ... I would settle for my old body back again, and my old strength. \"I knew that to achieve this  it is an old piece of Dark Magic, the potion that revived me tonight  I would need three powerful ingredients. Well, one of them was already at hand, was it not, Wormtail? Flesh given by a servant. . . . \"My father's bone, naturally, meant that we would have to come here, where he was buried. But the blood of a foe ... Wormtail would have had me use any wizard, would you not, Wormtail? Any wizard who had hated me ... as so many of them still do. But I knew the one I must use, if I was to rise again, more powerful than I had been when I had fallen. I wanted Harry Potters blood. I wanted the blood of the one who had stripped me of power thirteen years ago . . . for the lingering protection his mother once gave him would then reside in my veins too. . \"But how to get at Harry Potter? For he has been better protected than I think even he knows, protected in ways devised by Dumbledore long ago, when it fell to him to arrange the boy's future. Dumbledore invoked an ancient magic, to ensure the boy's protection as long as he is in his relations' care. Not even I can touch him there. . . . Then, of course, there was the Quidditch World Cup. ... I thought his protection might be weaker there, away from his relations and Dumbledore, but I was not yet strong enough to attempt kidnap in the midst of a horde of Ministry wizards. And then, the boy would return to Hogwarts, where he is under the crooked nose of that Muggleloving fool from morning until night. So how could I take him! \"Why ... by using Bertha Jorkins's information, of course. Use my one faithful Death Eater, stationed at Hogwarts, to ensure that the boy's name was entered into the Goblet of Fire. Use my Death Eater to ensure that the boy won the tournament  that he touched the Triwizard Cup first  the cup which my Death Eater had turned into a Portkey, which would bring him here, beyond the reach of Dumbledore's help and protection, and into my waiting arms. And here he is ... the boy you all believed had been my downfall. ...\" Voldemort moved slowly forward and turned to face Harry. He raised his wand. \"Crucio!\" It was pain beyond anything Harry had ever experienced; his very bones were on fire; his head was surely splitting along his scar; his eyes were rolling madly in his head; he wanted it to end ... to black out... to die ... And then it was gone. He was hanging limply in the ropes binding him to the headstone of Voldemort's father, looking up into those bright red eyes through a kind of mist. The night was ringing with the sound of the Death Eaters' laughter. \"You see, I think, how foolish it was to suppose that this boy could ever have been stronger than me,\" said Voldemort. \"But I want there to be no mistake in anybody's mind. Harry Potter escaped me by a lucky chance. And I am now going to prove my power by killing him, here and now, in front of you all, when there is no Dumbledore to help him, and no mother to die for him. I will give him his chance. He will be allowed to fight, and you will be left in no doubt which of us is the stronger. Just a little longer, Nagini,\" he whispered, and the snake glided away through the grass to where the Death Eaters stood watching. \"Now untie him, Wormtail, and give him back his wand.\" \n",

            "-Five King’s Cross He lay facedown, listening to the silence. He was perfectly alone. Nobody was watching. Nobody else was there. He was not perfectly sure that he was there himself. A long time later, or maybe no time at all, it came to him that he must exist, must be more than disembodied thought, because he was lying, definitely lying, on some surface. Therefore he had a sense of touch, and the thing against which he lay existed too. Almost as soon as he had reached this conclusion, Harry became conscious that he was naked. Convinced as he was of his total solitude, this did not concern him, but it did intrigue him slightly. He wondered whether, as he could feel, he would be able to see. In opening them, he discovered that he had eyes. He lay in a bright mist, though it was not like mist he had ever experienced before. His surroundings were not hidden by cloudy vapor; rather the cloudy vapor had not yet formed into surroundings. The floor on which he lay seemed to be white, neither warm nor cold, but simply there, a flat, blank something on which to be. He sat up. His body appeared unscathed. He touched his face. He was not wearing glasses anymore. Then a noise reached him through the unformed nothingness that surrounded him: the small soft thumpings of something that flapped, flailed, and struggled. It was a pitiful noise, yet also slightly indecent. He had the uncomfortable feeling that he was eavesdropping on something furtive, shameful. For the first time, he wished he were clothed. Barely had the wish formed in his head than robes appeared a short distance away. He took them and pulled them on. They were soft, clean, and warm. It was extraordinary how they had appeared just like that, the moment he had wanted them. . . . He stood up, looking around. Was he in some great Room of Requirement? The longer he looked, the more there was to see. A great domed glass roof glittered high above him in sunlight. Perhaps it was a palace. All was hushed and still, except for those odd thumping and whimpering noises coming from somewhere close by in the mist. . . . Harry turned slowly on the spot, and his surroundings seemed to invent themselves before his eyes. A wide-open space, bright and clean, a hall larger by far than the Great Hall, with that clear domed glass ceiling. It was quite empty. He was the only person there, except for - He recoiled. He had spotted the thing that was making the noises. It had the form of a small, naked child, curled on the ground, its skin raw and rough, flayed-looking, and it lay shuddering under a seat where it had been left, unwanted, stuffed out of sight, struggling for breath. He was afraid of it. Small and fragile and wounded though it was, he did not want to approach it. Nevertheless he drew slowly nearer, ready to jump back at any moment. Soon he stood near enough to touch it, yet he could not bring himself to do it. He felt like a coward. He ought to comfort it, but it repulsed him. \"You cannot help.\" He spun around. Albus Dumbledore was walking toward him, sprightly and upright, wearing sweeping robes of midnight blue. \"Harry.\" He spread his arms wide, and his hands were both whole and white and undamaged. \"You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk.\" Stunned, Harry followed as Dumbledore strode away from where the flayed child lay whimpering, leading him to two seats that Harry had not previously noticed, set some distance away under that high, sparkling ceiling. Dumbledore sat down in one of them, and Harry fell into the other, staring at his old headmaster’s face. Dumbledore’s long silver hair and beard, the piercingly blue eyes behind half-moon spectacles, the crooked nose: Everything was as he had remembered it. And yet . . . \"But you’re dead,\" said Harry. \"Oh yes,\" said Dumbledore matter-of-factly. \"Then . . . I’m dead too?\" \"Ah,\" said Dumbledore, smiling still more broadly. \"That is the question, isn’t it? On the whole, dear boy, I think not.\" They looked at each other, the old man still beaming. \"Not?\" repeated Harry. \"Not,\" said Dumbledore. \"But . . .\" Harry raised his hand instinctively toward the lightning scar. It did not seem to be there. \"But I should have died - I didn’t defend myself! I meant to let him kill me!\" \"And that,\" said Dumbledore, \"will, I think, have made all the difference.\" Happiness seemed to radiate from Dumbledore like light; like fire: Harry had never seen the man so utterly, so palpably content. \"Explain,\" said Harry. \"But you already know,\" said Dumbledore. He twiddled his thumbs together. \"I let him kill me,\" said Harry. \"Didn’t I?\" \"You did,\" said Dumbledore, nodding. \"Go on!\" \"So the part of his soul that was in me . . .\" Dumbledore nodded still more enthusiastically, urging Harry onward, a broad smile of encouragement on his face. \". . . has it gone?\" \"Oh yes!\" said Dumbledore. \"Yes, he destroyed it. Your soul is whole, and completely your own, Harry.\" \"But then . . .\" Harry trembled over his shoulder to where the small, maimed creature trembled under the chair. \"What is that, Professor?\" \"something that is beyond either of our help,\" said Dumbledore. \"But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,\" Harry started again, \"and nobody died for me this time - how can I be alive?\" \"I think you know,\" said Dumbledore. \"Think back. Remember what he did, in his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.\" Harry thought. He let his gaze drift over his surroundings. If it was indeed a palace in which they sat, it was an odd one, with chairs set in little rows and bits of railing here and there, and still, he and Dumbledore and the stunted creatures under the chair were the only beings there. Then the answer rose to his lips easily, without effort. \"He took my blood,\" said Harry. \"Precisely!\" said Dumbledore. \"He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily’s protection inside both of you! He thethered you to life while he lives!\" \"I live . . . while he lives? But I thought . . . I thought it was the other way around! I thought we both had to die? Or is it the same thing?\" He was distracted by the whimpering and thumping of the agonized creature behind them and glanced back at it yet again. \"Are you sure we can’t do anything?\" \"There is no help possible.\" \"Then explain . . . more,\" said Harry, and Dumbledore smiled. \"You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry, the Horcrux he never meant to make. He had rendered his soul so unstable that it broke apart when he committed those acts of unspeakable evil, the murder of your parents, the attempted killing of a child. But what escaped from that room was even less than he knew. He left more than his body behind. He left part of himself latched to you, the would-be victim who had survived. \"And his knowledge remained woefully incomplete, Harry! That which Voldemort does not value, he takes no trouble to comprehend. Of house-elves and children’s tales, of love, loyalty, and innocence, Voldemort knows and understands nothing. Nothing. That they all have a power beyond his own, a power beyond the reach of any magic, is a truth he has never grasped. \"He took your blood believing it would strengthen him. He took into his body a tiny part of the enchantment your mother laid upon you when she died for you. His body keeps her sacrafice alive, and while that enchantment survives, so do you and so does Voldemort’s one last hope for himself.\" Dumbledore smiled at Harry, and Harry stared at him. \"And you knew this? You knew - all along?\" \"I guessed. But my guesses have usually been good,\" said Dumbledore happily, and they sat in silence for what seemed like a long time, while the creature behind them continued to whimper and tremble. \"There’s more,\" said Harry. \"There’s more to it. Why did my wand break the wand he borrowed?\" \"As to that, I cannot be sure.\" \"Have a guess, then,\" said Harry, and Dumbledore laughed. \"What you must understand, Harry, is that you and Lord Voldemort have journeyed together into realms of magic hitherto unknown and untested. But here is what I think happened, and it is unprecedented, and no wandmaker could, I think, ever have predicted or explained it to Voldemort. \"Without meaning to, as you now know, Lord Voldemort doubled the bond between you when he returned to a human form. A part of his soul was still attached to yours, and, thinking to strengthen himself, he took a part of your mother’s sacrafice into himself. If he could only have understood the precise and terrible power of that sacrifice, he would not, perhaps, have dared to touch your blood. . . . But then, if he had been able to understand, he could not be Lord Voldemort, and might never have murdered at all. \"Having ensured this two-fold connection, having wrapped your destinies together more securely than ever two wizards were joined in history, Voldemort proceeded to attack you with a wand that shared a core with yours. And now something very strange happened, as we know. The cores reacted in a way that Lord Voldemort, who never knew that your wand was a twin of his, had ever expected. \"He was more afraid than you were that night, Harry. You had accepted, even embraced, the possibility of death, something Lord Voldemort has never been able to do. Your courage won, your wand overpowered his. And in doing so, something happened between those wands, something that echoed the relationship between their masters. \"I believe that your wand imbibed some of the power and qualities of Voldemort’s wand that night, which is to say that it contained a little of Voldemort himself. So your wand recognized him when he pursued you, recognized a man who was both kin and mortal enemy, and it regurgitated some of his own magic against him, magic much more powerful than anything Lucius’s wand had ever performed. Your wand now contained the power of your enormous courage and of Voldemort’s own deadly skill: What chance did that poor stick of Lucius Malfoy’s stand?\" \"But if my wand was so powerful, how come Hermione was able to break it?\" asked Harry. \"My dear boy, its remarkable effects were directed only at Voldemort, who had tampered so ill-advisedly with the deepest laws of magic. Only toward him was that wand abnormally powerful. Otherwise it was a wand like any other . . . though a good one, I am sure,\" Dumbledore finished kindly. Harry sat in thought for a long time, or perhaps seconds. It was very hard to be sure of things like time, here. \"He killed me with your wand.\" \"He failed to kill you with my wand,\" Dumbledore corrected Harry. \"I think we can agree that you are not dead - though, of course,\" he added, as if fearing he had been discourteous, \"I do not minimize your sufferings, which I am sure were severe.\" \"I feel great at the moment, though,\" said Harry, looking down at his clean, unblemished hands. \"Where are we, exactly?\" \"Well, I was going to ask you that,\" said Dumbledore, looking around. \"Where would you say that we are?\" Until Dumbledore had asked, Harry had not known. Now, however, he found that he had an answer ready to give. \"It looks,\" he said slowly, \"like King’s Cross station. Except a lo cleaner and empty, and there are no trains as far as I can see.\" \"King’s Cross station!\" Dumbledore was chuckling immoderately. \"Good gracious, really?\" \"Well, where do you think we are?\" asked Harry, a little defensively. \"My dear boy, I have no idea. This is, as they say, your party.\" Harry had no idea what this meant; Dumbledore was being infuriating. He glared at him, then remembered a much more pressing question than that of their current location. \"The Deathly Hallows,\" he said, and he was glad to see that the words wiped the smile from Dumbledore’s face. \"Ah, yes,\" he said. He even looked a little worried. \"Well?\" For the first time since Harry had met Dumbledore, he looked less than an old man, much less. He looked fleetingly like a small boy caught in wrongdoing. \"Can you forgive me?\" he said. \"Can you forgive me for not trusting you? For not telling you? Harry, I only feared that you would fail as I had failed. I only dreaded that you would make my mistakes. I crave your pardon, Harry. I have known, for some time now, that you are the better man.\" \"What are you talking about?\" asked Harry, startled by Dumbledore’s tone, by the sudden tears in his eyes. \"The Hallows, the Hallows,\" murmured Dumbledore. \"A desperate man’s dream!\" \"But they’re real!\" \"Real, and dangerous, and a lure for fools,\" said Dumbledore. \"And I was such a fool. But you know, don’t you? I have no secrets from you anymore. You know.\" \"What do I know?\" Dumbledore turned his whole body to face Harry, and tears still sparkled in the brilliantly blue eyes. \"Master of death, Harry, master of Death! Was I better, ultimately, than Voldemort?\" \"Of course you were,\" said Harry. \"Of course - how can you ask that? You never killed if you could avoid it!\" \"True, true,\" said Dumbledore, and he was like a child seeking reassurance. \"Yet I too sought a way to conquer death, Harry.\" \"Not the way he did,\" said Harry. After all his anger at Dumbledore, how odd it was to sit here, beneath the high, vaulted ceiling, and defend Dumbledore from himself. \"Hallows, not Horcruxes.\" \"Hallows,\" murmured Dumbledore, \"not Horcruxes. Precisely.\" There was a pause. The creature behind them whimpered, but Harry no longer looked around. \"Grindelwald was looking for them too?\" he asked. Dumbledore closed his eyes for a moment and nodded. \"It was the thing, above all, that drew us together,\" he said quietly. \"Two clever, arrogant boys with a shared obsession. He wanted to come to Godric’s Hollow, as I am sure you have guessed, because of the grave of Ignotus Peverell. He wanted to explore the place the third brother had died.\" \"So it’s true?\" asked Harry. \"All of it? The Peverell brothers -\" \"-were the three brothers of the tale,\" said Dumbledore, nodding. \"Oh yes, I think so. Whether they met Death on a lonely road . . . I think it more likely that the Peverell brothers were simply gifted, dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those powerful objects. The story of them being Death’s own Hallows seems to me the sort of legend that might have sprung up around such creations. \"The Cloak, as you know now, traveled down through the ages, father to son, mother to daughter, right down to Ignotus’s last living descendant, who was born, as Ignotus was, in the village of Godric’s Hollow.\" Dumbledore smiled at Harry. \"Me?\" \"You. You have guessed,, I know, why the Cloak was in my possession on the night your parents died. James had showed it to me just a few days previously. It explained much of his undetected wrongdoing at school! I could hardly believe what I was seeing. I asked to borrow it, to examine it. I had long since given up my dream of uniting the Hallows, but I could not resist, could not help taking a closer look. . . . It was a Cloak the likes of which I had never seen, immensely old, perfect in every respect . . . and then your father died, and I had two Hallows at last, all to myself!\" His tone was unbearably bitter. \"The Cloak wouldn’t have helped them survive, though,\" Harry said quickly. \"Voldemort knew where my mum and dad were. The Cloak couldn’t have made them curse-proof.\" \"true,\" sighed Dumbledore. \"True.\" Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not speak, so he prompted him. \"So you’d given up looking for the Hallows when you saw the Cloak?\" \"Oh yes,\" said Dumbledore faintly. It seemed that he forced himself to meet Harry’s eyes. \"You know what happened. You know. You cannot despise me more than I despise myself.\" \"But I don’t despise you -\" \"Then you should,\" said Dumbledore. He drew a deep breath. \"You know the secret of my sister’s ill health, what those Muggles did, what she became. You know how my poor father sought revenge, and paid the price, died In Azkaban. You know how my mother gave up her own life to care for Ariana. \"I resented it, Harry.\" Dumbledore stated it baldly, coldly. He was looking now over the top of Harry’s head, into the distance. \"I was gifted, I was brilliant. I wanted to escape. I wanted to shine. I wanted glory. \"Do not misunderstand me,\" he said, and pain crossed the face so that he looked ancient again. \"I loved them, I loved my parents, I loved my brother and my sister, but I was selfish, Harry, more selfish than you, who are a remarkably selfless person, could possibly imagine. \"So that, when my mother died, and I was left the responsibility of a damaged sister and a wayward brother, I returned to my village in anger and bitterness. Trapped and wasted, I thought! And then of course, he came. . . .\" Dumbledore looked directly into Harry’s eyes again. \"Grindelwald. You cannot imagine how his ideas caught me, Harry, inflamed me. Muggles forced into subservience. We wizards triumphant. Grindelwald and I, the glorious young leaders of the revolution. \"Oh, I had a few scruples. I assuaged my conscience with empty words. It would all be for the greater good, and any harm done would be repaid a hundredfold in benefits for wizards. Did I know, in my heart of hearts, what Gellert Grindelwald was? I think I did, but I closed my eyes. If the plans we were making came to fruition, all my dreams would come true. \"And at the heart of our schemes, the Deathly Hallows! How they fascinated him, how they fascinated both of us! The unbeatable wand, the weapon that would lead us to power! The Resurrection Stone - to him, though I pretended not to know it, it meant an army of Inferi! To me, I confess, it meant the return of my parents, and the lifting of all responsibility from my shoulders. \"And the Cloak . . . somehow, we never discussed the Cloak much, Harry. Both of us could conceal ourselves well enough without the Cloak, the true magic of which, of course, is that it can be used to protect and shield others as well as its owner. I thought that, if we ever found it, it might be useful in hiding Ariana, but our interest in the Cloak was mainly that it completed the trio, for the legend said that the man who had united all three objects would then be truly master of death, which we took to mean ‘invincible.’ \"Invincible masters of death, Grindelwald and Dumbledore! Two months of insanity, of cruel dreams, and neglect of the only two members of my family left to me. \"And then . . . you know what happened. Reality returned in the form of my rough, unlettered, and infinitely more admirable brother. I did not want to hear the truths he shouted at me. I did not want to hear that I could not set forth and seek Hallows with a fragile and unstable sister in tow. \"The argument became a fight. Grindelwald lost control. That which I had always sensed in him, though I pretended not to, now sprang into terrible being. And Ariana . . . after all my mother’s care and caution . . . lay dead upon the floor.\" Dumbledore gave a little gasp and began to cry in earnest. Harry reached out and was glad to find that he could touch him: He gripped his arm tightly and Dumbledore gradually regained control. \"Well, Grindelwald fled, as anyone but I could have predicted. He vanished, with his plans for seizing power, and his schemes for Muggle torture, and his dreams of the Deathly Hallows, dreams in which I had encouraged him and helped him. He ran, while I was left to bury my sister, and learn to live with my guilt and my terrible grief, the price of my shame. \"Years passed. There were rumors about him. They said he had procured a wand of immense power. I, meanwhile, was offered the post of Minister of Magic, not once, but several times. Naturally, I refused. I had learned that I was not to be trusted with power.\" \"But you’d have been better, much better, than Fudge or Scimgeour!\" burst out Harry. \"Would I?\" asked Dumbledore heavily. \"I am not so sure. I had proven, as a very young man, that power was my weakness and my temptation. It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those who, like you, have leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle because they must, and find to their own surprise that they wear it well. \"I was safer at Hogwarts. I think I was a good teacher -\" \"You were the best ---\" \"--- you are very kind, Harry. But while I busied myself with the training of young wizards, Grindelwald was raising an army. They say he feared me, and perhaps he did, but less, I think, than I feared him. \"Oh, not death,\" said Dumbledore, in answer to Harry’s questioning look. \"Not what he could do to me magically. I knew that we were evenly matched, perhaps that I was a shade more skillful. It was the truth I feared. You see, I never knew which of us, in that last, horrific fight, had actually cast the curse that killed my sister. You may call me cowardly: You would be right, Harry. I dreaded beyond all things the knowledge that it had been I who brought about her death, not merely through my arrogance and stupidity, but that I actually struck the blow that snuffed out her life. \"I think he knew it, I think he knew what frightened me. I delayed meeting him until finally, it would have been too shameful to resist any longer. People were dying and he seemed unstoppable, and I had to do what I could. \"Well, you know what happened next. I won the duel. I won the wand.\" Another silence. Harry did not ask whether Dumbledore had ever found out who struck Ariana dead. He did not want to know, and even less did he want Dumbledore to have to tell him. At last he knew what Dumbledore would have seen when he looked in the mirror of Erised, and why Dumbledore had been so understanding of the fascination it had exercised over Harry. They sat in silence for a long time, and the whipmerings of the creature behind them barely disturbed Harry anymore. At last he said, \"Grindelwald tried to stop Voldemort going after the wand. He lied, you know, pretended he had never had it.\" Dumbledore nodded, looking down at his lap, tears still glittering on the crooked nose. \"They say he showed remorse in later years, alone in his cell at Nurmengard. I hope that is true. I would like to think that he did feel the horror and shame of what he had done. Perhaps that lie to Voldemort was his attempt to make amends . . . to prevent Voldemort from taking the Hallow . . .\" \". . .or maybe from breaking into your tomb?\" suggested Harry, and Dumbledore dabbed his eyes. After another short pause Harry said, \"You tried to use the Resurrection Stone.\" Dumbledore nodded. \"When I discovered it, after all those years, buried in the abandoned home of the Gaunts --- the Hallow I had craved most of all, though in my youth I had wanted it for very different reasons --- I lost my head, Harry. I quite forgot that I was not a Horcrux, that the ring was sure to carry a curse. I picked it up, and I put it on, and for a second I imagined that I was about to see Ariana, and my mother, and my father, and to tell them how very, very sorry, I was. . . . \"I was such a fool, Harry. After all those years I had learned nothing. I was unworthy to unite the Deathly Hallows, I had proved it time and again, and here was final proof.\" \"Why?\" said Harry. \"It was natural! You wanted to see them again. What’s wrong with that?\" \"Maybe a man in a million could unite the Hallows, Harry. I was fit only to possess the meanest of them, the least extraordinary. I was fit to own the Elder Wand, and not boast of it, and not to kill with it. I was permitted to tame and use it, because I took it, not for gain, but to save others from it. \"But the Cloak, I took out of vain curiousity, and so it could never have worked for me as it works for you, its true owners. The stone I would have used in an attempt to drag back those who are at peace, rather than enable my self-sacrafice, as you did. You are the worthy possessor of the Hallows.\" Dumbledore patted Harry’s hand, and Harry looked up at the old man and smiled; he could not help himself. How coul dhe remain angry with Dumbledore now? \"Why did you have to make it so difficult?\" Dumbledore’s smile was tremulous. \"I am afraid I counted on Miss Granger to slow you up, Harry. I was afraid that your hot head might dominate your good heart. I was scared that, if presented outright with the facts about those tempting objects, you might seize the Hallows as I did, at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons. If you laid hands on them, I wanted you to possess them safely. You are the true master of death, because the true master does not seek to run away from Death. He accepts that he must die, and understands that there are far, far worse things in the living world than dying.\" \"And Voldemort never knew about the Hallows?\" \"I do not think so, because he did not recognize the Resurrection Stone he turned into a Horcrux. But even if he had known about them, Harry. I doubt that he woul dhave been interested in any except the first. He would not think that he needed the Cloak, and as for the stone, whom would he want to bring back from the dead? He fears the dead. He does not love.\" \"But you expected him to go after the wand?\" \"I have been sure that he would try, ever since your wand beat Voldemort’s in the graveyard of Little Hangleton. At first, he was afraid that you had conquered him by superior skill. Once he had kidnapped Ollivander, however, he discovered the existence of the twin cores. He thought that explained everything. Yet the borrowed wand did no better against yours! So Voldemort, instead of asking himself what quality it was in you that had made your wand so strong, what gift you possessed that he did not, naturally set out to find the one wand that, they said, would beat any other. For him, the Elder Wand has become an obsession to rival his obsession with you. He believes that the Elder Wand removes his last weakness and makes him truly invincible. Poor Severus . . .\" \"If you planned your death with Snape, you meant him to end up with the Elder Wand, didn’t you?\" \"I admit that was my intention,\" said Dumbledore, \"but it did not work as I intended, did it?\" \"No,\" said Harry. \"That bit didn’t work out.\" The creature behind them jerked and moaned, and Harry and Dumbledore sate without talking for the longest time yet. The realization of what would happen next settled gradually over Harry in the long minutes, like softly falling snow. \"I’ve got to go back, haven’t I?\" \"That is up to you.\" \"I’ve got a choice?\" \"Oh yes,\" Dumbledore smiled at him. \"We are in King’s Cross you say? I think that if you decided not to go back, you would be able to . . . let’s say . . . board a train.\" \"And where would it take me?\" \"On,\" said Dumbledore simply. Silence again. \"Voldemort’s got the Elder Wand.\" \"True. Voldemort has the Elder Wand.\" \"But you want me to go back?\" \"I think,\" said Dumbledore, \"that if you choose to return, there is a chance that he may be finished for good. I cannot promise it. But I know this, Harry, that you have less to fear from returning here than he does.\" Harry glanced again at the raw looking thing that trembled and choked in the shadow beneath the distant chair. \"Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and above all, those who live without love. By returning, you may ensure that fewer souls are maimed, fewer families are torn apart. If that seems to you a worthy goal, they we saw good-bye for the present.\" Harry nodded and sighed. Leaving this place would not be nearly as hard as walking into the forest had been, but it was warm and light and peaceful here, and he knew that he was heading back to pain and the fear of more loss. He stood up, and Dumbledore did the same, and they looked for a long moment into each other’s faces. \"Tell me one last thing,\" said Harry, \"Is this real? Or has this been happening inside my head?\" Dumbledore beamed at him, and his voice sounded loud and strong in Harry’s ears even though the bright mist was descending again, obscuring his figure. \"Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean it is not real?\" \n",

            ": Horcruxes Harry could feel the Felix Felicis wearing off as he creeped back into the castle. The front door had remained un locked for him, but on the third floor he met Peeves and only narrowly avoided detection by diving sideways through one of his shortcuts. By the time he got up to the portrait of the Fat Lady and pulled off his Invisibility Cloak, he was not surprised to find her in a most unhelpful mood. \"What sort of time do you call this?\" \"I'm really sorry -- I had to go out for something important --\" \"Well, the password changed at midnight, so you'll just have to sleep in the corridor, won't you?\" \"You're joking!\" said Harry. \"Why did it have to change at midnight?\" \"That's the way it is,\" said the Fat Lady. \"If you're angry, go and take it up with the headmaster, he's the one who's tightened security.\" \"Fantastic,\" said Harry bitterly, looking around at the hard floor. \"Really brilliant. Yeah, I would go and take it up with Dumbledore if he was here, because he's the one who wanted me to --\" \"He is here,\" said a voice behind Harry. \"Professor Dumbledore returned to the school an hour ago.\" Nearly Headless Nick was gliding toward Harry, his head wob-bling as usual upon his ruff. \"I had it from the Bloody Baron, who saw him arrive,\" said Nick. \"He appeared, according to the Baron, to be in good spirits, though a little tired, of course.\" \"Where is he?\" said Harry, his heart leaping,\" \"Oh, groaning and clanking up on the Astronomy Tower, it's a, favorite pastime of his --\" \"Not the Bloody Baron -- Dumbledore!\" \"Oh -- in his office,\" said Nick. \"I believe, from what the Baron said, that he had business to attend to before turning in --\" \"Yeah, he has,\" said Harry, excitement blazing in his chest at the prospect of telling Dumbledore he had secured the memory. He wheeled about and sprinted off again, ignoring the Fat Lady who was calling after him. \"Come back! All right, I lied! I was annoyed you woke me up! The password's still 'tapeworm'!\" But Harry was already hurtling back along the corridor and within minutes, he was saying \"toffee eclairs\" to Dumbledore's gar-goyle, which leapt aside, permitting Harry entrance onto the spiral staircase. \"Enter,\" said Dumbledore when Harry knocked. He sounded exhausted. Harry pushed open the door. There was Dumbledore's office, looking the same as ever, but with black, star-strewn skies beyond the windows. \"Good gracious, Harry,\" said Dumbledore in surprise. \"To what do I owe this very late pleasure?\" \"Sir -- I've got it. I’ve got the memory from Slughorn.\" Harry pulled out the tiny glass bottle and showed it to Dumbledore. For a moment or two, the headmaster looked stunned. Then his face split in a wide smile. \"Harry, this is spectacular news! Very well done indeed! I knew you could do it!\" All thought of the lateness of the hour apparently forgotten, he hurried around his desk, took the bottle with Slughorn's memory in his uninjured hand, and strode over to the cabinet where he kepi the Pensieve. \"And now,\" said Dumbledore, placing the stone basin upon the desk and emptying the contents of the bottle into it. \"Now, at last. we shall see. Harry, quickly . . .\" Harry bowed obediently over the Pensieve and felt his feet leave the office floor. . . . Once again he fell through darkness and landed in Horace Slughorn's office many years before. There was the much younger Slughorn, with his thick, shiny, straw-colored hair and his gingery-blond mustache, sitting again in the comfortable winged armchair in his office, his feet resting upon a velvet pouffe, a small glass of wine in one hand, the other rummaging in a box of crystallized pineapple. And there were the half dozen teenage boys sitting around Slughorn with Tom Riddle in the midst of them, Marvolo's gold-and-black ring gleaming on his finger. Dumbledore landed beside Harry just as Riddle asked, \"Sir is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?\" \"Tom, Tom, if I knew I couldn't tell you,\" said Slughorn, wag-ging his finger reprovingly at Riddle, though winking at the same time. \"I must say, I'd like to know where you get your information, boy, more knowledgeable than half the staff, you are.\" Riddle smiled; the other boys laughed and cast him admiring looks. \"What with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldn't, and your careful flattery of the people who matter -- thank you for the pineapple, by the way, you're quite right, it is my favorite --\" Several of the boys tittered again. \"-- I confidently expect you to rise to Minister of Magic within twenty years. Fifteen, if you keep sending me pineapple, I have ex-cellent contacts at the Ministry.\" Tom Riddle merely smiled as the others laughed again. Harry noticed that he was by no means the eldest of the group of boys, but that they all seemed to look to him as their leader. \"I don't know that politics would suit me, sir,\" he said when the laughter had died away. \"I don't have the right kind of background, for one thing.\" A couple of the boys around him smirked at each other. Harry was sure they were enjoying a private joke, undoubtedly about what they knew, or suspected, regarding their gang leader's famous ancestor. \"Nonsense,\" said Slughorn briskly, \"couldn't be plainer you come from decent Wizarding stock, abilities like yours. No, you'll go far, Tom, I've never been wrong about a student yet.\" The small golden clock standing upon Slughorn's desk chimed eleven o'clock behind him and he looked around. \"Good gracious, is it that time already? You'd better get going boys, or we'll all be in trouble. Lestrange, I want your essay by in morrow or it's detention. Same goes for you, Avery.\" One by one, the boys filed out of the room. Slughorn heaved himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk. A movement behind him made him look around; Riddle was still standing there. \"Look shar p, Tom, you don't want to be caught out of bed out of hours, and you a prefect.. .\" \"Sir, I wanted to ask you something.\" -' \"Ask away, then, m'boy, ask away. . . .\" \"Sir, I wondered what you know about. . . about Horcruxes?' Slughorn stared at him, his thick ringers absentmindedly clawing the stem of his wine glass. \"Project for Defense Against the Dark Arts, is it?\" But Harry could tell that Slughorn knew perfectly well that this was not schoolwork. \"Not exactly, sir,\" said Riddle. \"I came across the term while reading and I didn't fully understand it.\" \"No . . . well. . . you'd be hard-pushed to find a book at Hogwarts that'll give you details on Horcruxes, Tom, that's very Dark stuff, very Dark indeed,\" said Slughorn. \"But you obviously know all about them, sir? I mean, a wizard like you -- sorry, I mean, if you can't tell me, obviously -- I just knew if anyone could tell me, you could -- so I just thought I'd –\" It was very well done, thought Harry, the hesitancy, the casual tone, the careful flattery, none of it overdone. He, Harry, had had too much experience of trying to wheedle information out of re-luctant people not to recognize a master at work. He could tell that Riddle wanted the information very, very much; perhaps had been working toward this moment for weeks. \"Well,\" said Slughorn, not looking at Riddle, but fiddling with the ribbon on top of his box of crystallized pineapple, \"well, it can't hurt to give you an overview, of course. Just so that you understand t he term. A Horcrux is the word used for an object in which a per-son has concealed part of their soul.\" \"I don't quite understand how that works, though, sir,\" said Riddle. His voice was carefully controlled, but Harry could sense his excitement. \"Well, you split your soul, you see,\" said Slughorn, \"and hide part of it in an object outside the body. Then, even if one's body is attacked or destroyed, one cannot die, for part of the soul remains earthbound and undamaged. But of course, existence in such a form ...\" Slughorn's face crumpled and Harry found himself remember-ing words he had heard nearly two years before: \"I was ripped from my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost. . . but still, I was alive.\" \"... few would want it, Tom, very few. Death would be preferable.\" But Riddle's hunger was now apparent; his expression was greedy, he could no longer hide his longing. \"How do you split your soul?\" \"Well,\" said Slughorn uncomfortably, \"you must understand that the soul is supposed to remain intact and whole. Splitting n it I an act of violation, it is against nature.\" \"But how do you do it?\" \"By an act of evil -- the supreme act of evil. By commiting murder. Killing rips the soul apart. The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would use the damage to his advantage: He would encase the torn portion --\" \"Encase? But how -- ?\" \"There is a spell, do not ask me, I don't know!\" said Slughoin shaking his head like an old elephant bothered by mosquitoes. \" Do I look as though I have tried it -- do I look like a killer?\" \"No, sir, of course not,\" said Riddle quickly. \"I'm sorry ... I didn't mean to offend . . .\" \"Not at all, not at all, not offended,\" said Slughorn gruffly, \"It is natural to feel some curiosity about these things. . . . Wizards of a certain caliber have always been drawn to that aspect of magic. . . .\" \"Yes, sir,\" said Riddle. \"What I don't understand, though -- just out of curiosity -- I mean, would one Horcrux be much use? Can you only split your soul once? Wouldn't it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces, I mean, for instance, isn't seven the most powerfully magical number, wouldn't seven -- ?\" \"Merlin's beard, Tom!\" yelped Slughorn. \"Seven! Isn't it bad enough to think of killing one person? And in any case . . . bad enough to divide the soul . . . but to rip it into seven pieces . . .\" Slughorn looked deeply troubled now: He was gazing at Riddle as though he had never seen him plainly before, and Harry could tell that he was regretting entering into the conversation at all. \"Of course,\" he muttered, \"this is all hypothetical, what we're discussing, isn't it? All academic . . .\" \"Yes, sir, of course,\" said Riddle quickly. \"But all the same, Tom . . . keep it quiet, what I've told -- that's to say, what we've discussed. People wouldn't like to think we've been chatting about Horcruxes. It's a banned subject at Hogwarts, you know. . . . Dumbledore's particularly fierce about it. ...\" \"I won't say a word, sir,\" said Riddle, and he left, but not before Harry had glimpsed his face, which was full of that same wild hap-piness it had worn when he had first found out that he was a wiz-ard, the sort of happiness that did not enhance his handsome features, but made them, somehow, less human. . . . \"Thank you, Harry,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"Let us go. . . .\" When Harry landed back on the office floor Dumbledore was ; already sitting down behind his desk. Harry sat too and waited for Dumbledore to speak. \"I have been hoping for this piece of evidence for a very long time,\" said Dumbledore at last. \"It confirms the theory on which I have been working, it tells me that I am right, and also how very far there is still to go. ...\" Harry suddenly noticed that every single one of the old head-masters and headmistresses in the portraits around the walls was awake and listening in on their conversation. A corpulent, red nosed wizard had actually taken out an ear trumpet. \"Well, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, \"I am sure you understood the significance of what we just heard. At the same age as you are now, give or take a few months, Tom Riddle was doing all he could to find out how to make himself immortal.\" \"You think he succeeded then, sir?\" asked Harry. \"He made a Horcrux? And that's why he didn't die when he attacked me? He had a Horcrux hidden somewhere? A bit of his soul was safe?\" \"A bit... or more,\" said Dumbledore. \"You heard Voldemort, what he particularly wanted from Horace was an opinion on what would happen to the wizard who created more than one Horcrux, what would happen to the wizard so determined to evade death that he would be prepared to murder many times, rip his soul repeatedly, so as to store it in many, separately concealed Horcruxc. No book would have given him that information. As far as I know -- as far, I am sure, as Voldemort knew -- no wizard had ever done more than tear his soul in two.\" Dumbledore paused for a moment, marshaling his thought, and then said, \"Four years ago, I received what I considered certain proof that Voldemort had split his soul.\" \"Where?\" asked Harry. \"How?\" \"You handed it to me, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. \"The diary, Riddles diary, the one giving instructions on how to reopen the Chamber of Secrets.\" \"I don't understand, sir,\" said Harry. \"Well, although I did not see the Riddle who came out of the di-ary, what you described to me was a phenomenon I had never wit-nessed. A mere memory starting to act and think for itself? A mere memory, sapping the life out of the girl into whose hands it had fallen? No, something much more sinister had lived inside that book. ... a fragment of soul, I was almost sure of it. The diary had been a Horcrux. But this raised as many questions as it answered. What intrigued and alarmed me most was that that diary had been intended as a weapon as much as a safeguard.\" \"1 still don't understand,\" said Harry. \"Well, it worked as a Horcrux is supposed to work -- in other words, the fragment of soul concealed inside it was kept safe and had undoubtedly played its part in preventing the death of its owner. But there could be no doubt that Riddle really wanted that diary read, wanted the piece of his soul to inhabit or possess some-body else, so that Slytherin's monster would be unleashed again.\" \"Well, he didn't want his hard work to be wasted,\" said Harry. \"He wanted people to know he was Slytherin's heir, because he couldn't take credit at the time.\" \"Quite correct,\" said Dumbledore, nodding. \"But don't you see, Harry, that if he intended the diary to be passed to, or planted on, some future Hogwarts student, he was being remarkably blase about that precious fragment of his soul concealed within it. The point of a Horcrux is, as Professor Slughorn explained, to keep part of the self hidden and safe, not to fling it into somebody else's path and run the risk that they might destroy it -- as indeed happened: That particular fragment of soul is no more; you saw to that. The careless way in which Voldemort regarded this Horcrux seemed most ominous to me. It suggested that he must have made -- or had been planning to make -- more Horcruxes, so that the loss of his first would not be so detrimental. I did not wish to be-lieve it, but nothing else seemed to make sense. Then you told me, two years later, that on the night that Volde-mort returned to his body, he made a most illuminating and alarm-ing statement to his Death Eaters. ‘I who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality.’ That was what you told me he said. 'Further than anybody!' And I thought I knew what that meant, though the Death Eaters did not. He was referring to his Horcruxes, Horcruxes in the plural, Harry, which I don’t believe any other wizard has ever had. Yet it fitted: Lord Voldomort has seemed to grow less human with the passing years, and the transformation he had undergone seemed to me to be only explainable if his soul was mutilated beyond the realms of what we might call 'usual evil' . . .\" \"So he's made himself impossible to kill by murdering other people?\" said Harry. \"Why couldn't he make a Sorcerer's Stone, or steal one, if he was so interested in immortality?\" \"Well, we know that he tried to do just that, five years ago,\" s;n«l Dumbledore. \"But there are several reasons why, I think, a Sorcerer's Stone would appeal less than Horcruxes to Lord Voldemort, \"While the Elixir of Life does indeed extend life, it must lie drunk regularly, for all eternity, if the drinker is to maintain the immortality. Therefore, Voldemort would be entirely dependant on the Elixir, and if it ran out, or was contaminated, or if the Stone was stolen, he would die just like any other man. Voldemort likes to operate alone, remember. I believe that he would have found the thought of being dependent, even on the Elixir, intolerable. Of course he was prepared to drink it if it would take him out of the horrible part-life to which he was condemned after attacking you, but only to regain a body. Thereafter, I am convinced, he intended to continue to rely on his Horcruxes. He would need nothing more, if only he could regain a human form. He was already im-mortal, you see ... or as close to immortal as any man can be. But now, Harry, armed with this information, the crucial memory you have succeeded in procuring for us, we are closer to the se-cret of finishing Lord Voldemort than anyone has ever been before. You heard him, Harry: 'Wouldn't it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces . . . isn't seven the most powerfully magical number . . .' Isn't seven the most powerfully magical number. Yes, I think the idea of a seven-part soul would greatly appeal to Lord Voldemort.\" \"He made seven Horcruxes?\" said Harry, horror-struck, while several of the portraits on the walls made similar noises of shock mid outrage. \"But they could be anywhere in the world -- hidden -- buried or invisible --\" \"I am glad to see you appreciate the magnitude of the problem,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"But firstly, no, Harry, not seven Hor-cruxes: six. The seventh part of his soul, however maimed, resides inside his regenerated body. That was the part of him that lived a spectral existence for so many years during his exile; without that, he has no self at all. That seventh piece of soul will be the last that anybody wishing to kill Voldemort must attack -- the piece that lives in his body.\" \"But the six Horcruxes, then,\" said Harry, a little desperately, \"how are we supposed to find them?\" \"You are forgetting . . . you have already destroyed one of them. And I have destroyed another.\" \"You have?\" said Harry eagerly. \"Yes indeed,\" said Dumbledore, and he raised his blackened, burned-looking hand. \"The ring, Harry. Marvolo's ring. And a ter-rible curse there was upon it too. Had it not been -- forgive me the lack of seemly modesty -- for my own prodigious skill, and for Professor Snape's timely action when I returned to Hogwarts, des-perately injured, I might not have lived to tell the tale. However, a withered hand does not seem an unreasonable exchange for a sev-enth of Voldemort's soul. The ring is no longer a Horcrux.\" \"But how did you find it?\" \"Well, as you now know, for many years I have made it my business to discover as much as I can about Voldemort's past life. I have traveled widely, visiting those places he once knew. I stumbled across the ring hidden in the ruin of the Gaunt’s house. It seem that once Voldemort had succeeded in sealing a piece of his soul in side it, he did not want to wear it anymore. He hid it, protected by many powerful enchantments, in the shack where his ancestors had once lived (Morfin having been carted off to Azkaban, of course), never guessing that I might one day take the trouble to visit the ruin, or that I might be keeping an eye open for traces of magical concealment. \"However, we should not congratulate ourselves too heartily. You destroyed the diary and I the ring, but if we are right in our theory of a seven-part soul, four Horcruxes remain.\" \"And they could be anything?\" said Harry. \"They could be oh, in tin cans or, I dunno, empty potion bottles. . . .\" \"You are thinking of Portkeys, Harry, which must be ordinary objects, easy to overlook. But would Lord Voldemort use tin cans or old potion bottles to guard his own precious soul? You are forgetting what I have showed you. Lord Voldemort liked to collect trophies, and he preferred objects with a powerful magical history His pride, his belief in his own superiority, his determination to carve for himself a startling place in magical history; these things, suggest to me that Voldemort would have chosen his Horcruxr with some care, favoring objects worthy of the honor.\" \"The diary wasn't that special.\" \"The diary, as you have said yourself, was proof that he was the Hire of Slytherin. I am sure that Voldemort considered it of stu-pendous importance.\" \"So, the other Horcruxes?\" said Harry. \"Do you think you know what they are, sir?\" \"I can only guess,\" said Dumbledore. \"For the reasons I have al-ready given, I believe that Lord Voldemort would prefer objects that, in themselves, have a certain grandeur. I have therefore trawled back through Voldemort's past to see if I can find evidence that such artifacts have disappeared around him.\" \"The locket!\" said Harry loudly, \"Hufflepuff's cup!\" \"Yes,\" said Dumbledore, smiling, \"I would be prepared to bet -- perhaps not my other hand -- but a couple of fingers, that they be-came Horcruxes three and four. The remaining two, assuming again that he created a total of six, are more of a problem, but I will hazard a guess that, having secured objects from Hufflepuff and Slytherin, he set out to track down objects owned by Gryffindor or Ravenclaw. Four objects from the four founders would, I am sure, have exerted a powerful pull over Voldemort's imagination. I can-not answer for whether he ever managed to find anything of Ravenclaw's. I am confident, however, that the only known relic of Gryffindor remains safe.\" Dumbledore pointed his blackened fingers to the wall behind him, where a ruby-encrusted sword reposed within a glass case. \"Do you think that's why he really wanted to come back to Hogwarts, sir?\" said Harry. \"To try and find something from one of the other founders?\" \"My thoughts precisely,\" said Dumbledore. \"But unfortunately, that does not advance us much further, for he was turned away, or so I believe, without the chance to search the school. I am forced to conclude that he never fulfilled his ambition of collecting four founders' objects. He definitely had two -- he may have found three -- that is the best we can do for now.\" \"Even if he got something of Ravenclaw's or of Gryffindor's, that leaves a sixth Horcrux,\" said Harry, counting on his fingers. \"Unless he’s got both?\" \"I don't think so,\" said Dumbledore. \"I think I know what the sixth Horcrux is. I wonder what you will say when I confess that I have been curious for a while about the behavior of the snake, Nagini?' \"The snake?\" said Harry, startled. \"You can use animals as Horcruxes?\" \"Well, it is inadvisable to do so,\" said Dumbledore, \"because to confide a part of your soul to something that can think and move for itself is obviously a very risky business. However, if my calculations are correct, Voldemort was still at least one Horcrux short of his goal of six when he entered your parents' house with the inten-tion of killing you. He seems to have reserved the process of making Horcruxes for particularly significant deaths. You would certainly have been that. He believed that in killing you, he was destroying the danger the prophecy had outlined. He believed he was making himself invin-cible. I am sure that he was intending to make his final Horcrux with your death. As we know, he failed. After an interval of some years, however, he used Nagini to kill an old Muggle man, and it might then have occurred to him to turn her into his last Horcrux. She underlines the Slytherin connection, which enhances Lord Voldemorts mys-tique; I think he is perhaps as fond of her as he can be of anything; he certainly likes to keep her close, and he seems to have an un-usual amount of control over her, even for a Parselmouth.\" \"So,\" said Harry, \"the diary's gone, the ring's gone. The cup, the locket, and the snake are still intact, and you think there might be a Horcrux that was once Ravenclaw's or Gryffindor's?\" \"An admirably succinct and accurate summary, yes,\" said Dum-bledore, bowing his head. \"So . . . are you still looking for them, sir? Is that where you've been going when you've been leaving the school?\" \"Correct,\" said Dumbledore. \"I have been looking for a very long time. I think. . . perhaps ... I may be close to finding an-other one. There are hopeful signs.\" \"And if you do,\" said Harry quickly, \"can I come with you and help get rid of it?\" Dumbledore looked at Harry very intently for a moment before saying, \"Yes, I think so.\" \"I can?\" said Harry, thoroughly taken aback. \"Oh yes,\" said Dumbledore, smiling slightly. \"I think you have earned that right.\" Harry felt his heart lift. It was very good not to hear words of caution and protection for once. The headmasters and head-mistresses around the walls seemed less impressed by Dumbledore's decision; Harry saw a few of them shaking their heads and Phineas Nigellus actually snorted. \"Does Voldemort know when a Horcrux is destroyed, sir? Can he feel it?\" Harry asked, ignoring the portraits. \"A very interesting question, Harry. I believe not. I believe that Voldemort is now so immersed in evil, and these crucial parts of himself have been detached for so long, he does not feel as we do. Perhaps, at the point of death, he might be aware of his loss . . . but he was not aware, for instance, that the diary had been destroyed until he forced the truth out of Lucius Malfoy. When Voldemort discovered that the diary had been mutilated and robbed of all its powers, I am told that his anger was terrible to behold.\" \"But I thought he meant Lucius Malfoy to smuggle it into Hogwarts?\" \"Yes, he did, years ago, when he was sure he would be able to create more Horcruxes, but still Lucius was supposed to wait for Voldemorts say-so, and he never received it, for Voldemort van-ished shortly after giving him the diary. No doubt he thought that Lucius would not dare do anything with the Horcrux other than guard it carefully, but he was counting too much upon Lucius’s fear of a master who had been gone for years and whom Lucius believed dead. Of course, Lucius did not know what the diary really was. I understand that Voldemort had told him the diary would cause the Chamber of Secrets to reopen because it was cleverly enchanted. Had Lucius known he held a portion of his mas-ters soul in his hands, he would undoubtedly have treated it with more reverence -- but instead he went ahead and carried out the old plan for his own ends. By planting the diary upon Arthur Weasleys daughter, he hoped to discredit Arthur and get rid of a highly incrim-inating magical object in one stroke. Ah, poor Lucius . . . what with Voldemorts fury about the fact that he threw away the Horcrux for his own gain, and the fiasco at the Ministry last year, I would not be sur-prised if he is not secretly glad to be safe in Azkaban at the moment.\" Harry sat in thought for a moment, then asked, \"So if all of his Horcruxes are destroyed, Voldemort couldbe killed?\" \"Yes, I think so,\" said Dumbledore. \"Without his Horcruxes, Voldemort will be a mortal man with a maimed and diminished soul. Never forget, though, that while his soul may be damaged be-yond repair, his brain and his magical powers remain intact. It will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like Voldemort even without his Horcruxes.\" \"But I haven't got uncommon skill and power,\" said Harry, be-fore he could stop himself. \"Yes, you have,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"You have a power that Voldemort has never had. You can --\" \"I know!\" said Harry impatiently. \"I can love!\" It was only with difficulty that he stopped himself adding, \"Big deal!\" \"Yes, Harry, you can love,\" said Dumbledore, who looked as though he knew perfectly well what Harry had just refrained from saying. \"Which, given everything that has happened to you, is a great and remarkable thing. You are still too young to understand how unusual you are, Harry.\" \"So, when the prophecy says that I'll have 'power the Dark Lord knows not,' it just means -- love?\" asked Harry, feeling a little let down. \"Yes -- just love,\" said Dumbledore. \"But Harry, never forget that what the prophecy says is only significant because Voldemort made it so. I told you this at the end of last year. Voldemort singled you out as the person who would be most dangerous to him -- and in doing so, he made you the person who would be most dan-gerous to him!\" \"But it comes to the same --\" \"No, it doesn't!\" said Dumbledore, sounding impatient now. Pointing at Harry with his black, withered hand, he said, \"You are setting too much store by the prophecy!\" \"But,\" spluttered Harry, \"but you said the prophecy means --\" \"If Voldemort had never heard of the prophecy, would it have been fulfilled? Would it have meant anything? Of course not! Ho you think every prophecy in the Hall of Prophecy has been fulfilled?\" \"But,\" said Harry, bewildered, \"but last year, you said one of us would have to kill the other --\" \"Harry, Harry, only because Voldemort made a grave error, and acted on Professor Trelawney's words! If Voldemort had never murdered your father, would he have imparted in you a furious desire for revenge? Of course not! If he had not forced your mother to die for you, would he have given you a magical protection he could not penetrate? Of course not, Harry! Don't you see? Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back! Voldemort is no different! Always he was on the lookout for the one who would challenge him. He heard the prophecy and he leapt into ac-tion, with the result that he not only handpicked the man most likely to finish him, he handed him uniquely deadly weapons!\" \"But --\" \"It is essential that you understand this!\" said Dumbledore, standing up and striding about the room, his glittering robes swooshing in his wake; Harry had never seen him so agitated. \"By attempting to kill you, Voldemort himself singled out the remark-able person who sits here in front of me, and gave him the tools for the job! It is Voldemort's fault that you were able to see into his thoughts, his ambitions, that you even understand the snakelike language in which he gives orders, and yet, Harry, despite your privileged insight into Voldemort's world (which, incidentally, is a gift any Death Eater would kill to have), you have never been se-duced by the Dark Arts, never, even for a second, shown the slight-est desire to become one of Voldemort's followers!\" \"Of course I haven't!\" said Harry indignantly. \"He killed my mum and dad!\" \"You are protected, in short, by your ability to love!\" said Dum-bledore loudly. \"The only protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like Voldemort's! In spite of all the temptation you have endured, all the suffering, you remain pure of heart, just as pure as you were at the age of eleven, when you stared into a mir-ror that reflected your heart's desire, and it showed you only the way to thwart Lord Voldemort, and not immortality or riches. Harry, have you any idea how few wizards could have seen what you saw in that mirror? Voldemort should have known then what he was dealing with, but he did not! But he knows it now. You have flitted into Lord Voldemort's mind without damage to yourself, but he cannot possess you with-out enduring mortal agony, as he discovered in the Ministry. I do not think he understands why, Harry, but then, he was in such a hurry to mutilate his own soul, he never paused to understand the incomparable power of a soul that is untarnished and whole.\" \"But, sir,\" said Harry, making valiant efforts not to sound argu-mentative, \"it all comes to the same thing, doesn't it? I've got to try and kill him, or --\" \"Got to?\" said Dumbledore. \"Of course you've got to! But not because of the prophecy! Because you, yourself, will never rest until you've tried! We both know it! Imagine, please, just for a moment, that you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think!\" Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front ol him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father, and Sinus. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat. \"I'd want him finished,\" said Harry quietly. \"And I'd want to do it.\" \"Of course you would!\" cried Dumbledore. \"You see, the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal. ... In other words, you are free to choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! But Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy. He will continue to hunt you . . . which makes it certain, really, that --\" \"That one of us is going to end up killing the other,\" said Harry. \"Yes.\" But he understood at last what Dumbledore had been trying to tell him. It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumble-dore knew -- and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents -- that there was all the difference in the world. \n",

            ": Lord Voldemort's Request Harry and Ron left the hospital wing first thing on Monday morning, restored to full health by the ministrations of Madam Pomfrey and now able to enjoy the benefits of having been knocked out and poisoned, the best of which was that Hermione was friends with Ron again. Hermione even escorted them down to breakfast, bringing with her the news that Ginny had argued with Dean. The drowsing creature in Harry's chest suddenly raised its head, sniffing the air hopefully. \"What did they row about?\" he asked, trying to sound casual as they turned onto a seventh-floor corridor that was deserted but for a very small girl who had been examining a tapestry of trolls in tutus. She looked terrified at the sight of the approaching sixth years and dropped the heavy brass scales she was carrying. \"It's all right!\" said Hermione kindly, hurrying forward to help her. \"Here ...\" She tapped the broken scales with her wand and said, \"Reparo.\" The girl did not say thank you, but remained rooted to the spot as they passed and watched them out of sight; Ron glanced back at her. \"I swear they're getting smaller,\" he said. \"Never mind her,\" said Harry, a little impatiently. \"What did Ginny and Dean row about, Hermione?\" \"Oh, Dean was laughing about McLaggen hitting that Bludgu at you,\" said Hermione. \"It must've looked funny,\" said Ron reasonably. \"It didn't look funny at all!\" said Hermione hotly. \"It looked terrible and if Coote and Peakes hadn't caught Harry he could have been very badly hurt!\" \"Yeah, well, there was no need for Ginny and Dean to split up over it,\" said Harry, still trying to sound casual. \"Or are they still together?\" \"Yes, they are -- but why are you so interested?\" asked Hermione, giving Harry a sharp look. \"I just don't want my Quidditch team messed up again!\" he said hastily, but Hermione continued to look suspicious, and he was most relieved when a voice behind them called, \"Harry!\" giving him an excuse to turn his back on her. \"Oh, hi, Luna.\" - \"I went to the hospital wing to find you,\" said Luna, rummaging in her bag. \"But they said you'd left...\" She thrust what appeared to be a green onion, a large spotted toadstool, and a considerable amount of what looked like cat litter into Ron's hands, finally pulling out a rather grubby scroll of parchment that she handed to Harry. \". . . I've been told to give you this.\" It was a small roll of parchment, which Harry recognized at once as another invitation to a lesson with Dumbledore. \"Tonight,\" he told Ron and Hermione, once he had unrolled it. \"Nice commentary last match!\" said Ron to Luna as she took back the green onion, the toadstool, and the cat litter. Luna smiled vaguely. \"You're making fun of me, aren't you?\" she said. \"Everyone says I was dreadful.\" \"No, I'm serious!\" said Ron earnestly. \"I can't remember enjoying commentary more! What is this, by the way?\" he added, holding the onionlike object up to eye level. \"Oh, it's a Gurdyroot,\" she said, stuffing the cat litter and the toadstool back into her bag. \"You can keep it if you like, I've got a few of them. They're really excellent for warding off Gulping Plimpies.\" And she walked away, leaving Ron chortling, still clutching the Gurdyroot. \"You know, she's grown on me, Luna,\" he said, as they set off again for the Great Hall. \"I know she's insane, but it's in a good --\" He stopped talking very suddenly. Lavender Brown was standing at the foot of the marble staircase looking thunderous. \"Hi,\" said Ron nervously. \"C'mon,\" Harry muttered to Hermione, and they sped past, though not before they had heard Lavender say, \"Why didn't you tell me you were getting out today? And why was she with you?\" Ron looked both sulky and annoyed when he appeared at breakfast half an hour later, and though he sat with Lavender, Harry did not see them exchange a word all the time they were together. Hermione was acting as though she was quite oblivious to all of this, but once or twice Harry saw an inexplicable smirk cross her face. All that day she seemed to be in a particularly good mood, and that evening in the common room she even consented to look over (in other words, finish writing) Harry's Herbology essay, something she had been resolutely refusing to do up to this point, because she had known that Harry would then let Ron copy his work. \"Thanks a lot, Hermione,\" said Harry, giving her a hasty pat on the back as he checked his watch and saw that it was nearly eight o'clock. \"Listen, I’ve got to hurry or I'll be late for Dumbledore. ...\" She did not answer, but merely crossed out a few of his feebler sentences in a weary sort of way. Grinning, Harry hurried out through the portrait hole and off to the headmasters office. The gargoyle leapt aside at the mention of toffee eclairs, and Harry took the spiral staircase two steps at a time, knocking on the door just as a clock within chimed eight. \"Enter,\" called Dumbledore, but as Harry put out a hand to push the door, it was wrenched open from inside. There stood Professor Trelawney. \"Aha!\" she cried, pointing dramatically at Harry as she blinked at him through her magnifying spectacles. \"So this is the reason I am to be thrown unceremoniously from your office, Dumbledore!\" \"My dear Sybill,\" said Dumbledore in a slightly exasperated voice, \"there is no question of throwing you unceremoniously from anywhere, but Harry does have an appointment, and I really don't think there is any more to be said --\" \"Very well,\" said Professor Trelawney, in a deeply wounded voice. \"If you will not banish the usurping nag, so be it. ... Perhaps I shall find a school where my talents are better appreciated. ...\" She pushed past Harry and disappeared down the spiral staircase; they heard her stumble halfway down, and Harry guessed that she had tripped over one of her trailing shawls. \"Please close the door and sit down, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, sounding rather tired. Harry obeyed, noticing as he took his usual seat in front of Dumbledore's desk that the Pensieve lay between them once more, as did two more tiny crystal bottles full of swirling memory. \"Professor Trelawney still isn't happy Firenze is teaching, then?\" Harry asked. \"No,\" said Dumbledore, \"Divination is turning out to be much more trouble than I could have foreseen, never having studied the subject myself. I cannot ask Firenze to return to the forest, where he is now an outcast, nor can I ask Sybill Trelawney to leave. Between ourselves, she has no idea of the danger she would be in outside the castle. She does not know -- and I think it would be unwise to enlighten her -- that she made the prophecy about you and Voldemort, you see.\" Dumbledore heaved a deep sigh, then said, \"But never mind my staffing problems. We have much more important matters to discuss. Firstly -- have you managed the task I set you at the end of our previous lesson?\" \"Ah,\" said Harry, brought up short. What with Apparition lessons and Quidditch and Ron being poisoned and getting his skull cracked and his determination to find out what Draco Malfoy was up to, Harry had almost forgotten about the memory Dumbledore had asked him to extract from Professor Slughorn. \"Well, I asked Professor Slughorn about it at the end of Potions, sir, but, er, he wouldn't give it to me.\" There was a little silence. \"I see,\" said Dumbledore eventually, peering at Harry over the top of his half-moon spectacles and giving Harry the usual sensation that he was being X-rayed. \"And you feel that you have exerted your very best efforts in this matter, do you? That you have exercised all of your considerable ingenuity? That you have left no depth of cunning unplumbed in your quest to retrieve the memory?\" \"Well,\" Harry stalled, at a loss for what to say next. His single attempt to get hold of the memory suddenly seemed embarrassingly feeble. \"Well . . . the day Ron swallowed love potion by mistake I took him to Professor Slughorn. I thought maybe if I got Professor Slughorn in a good enough mood --\" \"And did that work?\" asked Dumbledore. \"Well, no, sir, because Ron got poisoned --\" \"-- which, naturally, made you forget all about trying to retrieve the memory; I would have expected nothing else, while your best friend was in danger. Once it became clear that Mr. Weasley was going to make a full recovery, however, I would have hoped that you returned to the task I set you. I thought I made it clear to you how very important that memory is. Indeed, I did my best to impress upon you that it is the most crucial memory of all and that we will be wasting our time without it.\" A hot, prickly feeling of shame spread from the top of Harry’s head all the way down his body. Dumbledore had not raised his voice, he did not even sound angry, but Harry would have preferred him to yell; this cold disappointment was worse than anything. \"Sir,\" he said, a little desperately, \"it isn't that I wasn't bothered or anything, I've just had other -- other things . . .\" \"Other things on your mind,\" Dumbledore finished the sentence for him. \"I see.\" Silence fell between them again, the most uncomfortable silence Harry had ever experienced with Dumbledore; it seemed to go on and on, punctuated only by the little grunting snores of the portrait of Armando Dippet over Dumbledore's head. Harry felt strangely diminished, as though he had shrunk a little since he had entered the room. When he could stand it no longer he said, \"Professor Dumbledore, I'm really sorry. I should have done more. ... I should have realized you wouldn't have asked me to do it if it wasn't really important.\" \"Thank you for saying that, Harry,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"May I hope, then, that you will give this matter higher priority from now on? There will be little point in our meeting after tonight unless we have that memory.\" \"I'll do it, sir, I'll get it from him,\" he said earnestly. \"Then we shall say no more about it just now,\" said Dumbledore more kindly, \"but continue with our story where we left off. You remember where that was?\" \"Yes, sir,\" said Harry quickly. \"Voldemort killed his father and his grandparents and made it look as though his Uncle Morfin did it. Then he went back to Hogwarts and he asked ... he asked Professor Slughorn about Horcruxes,\" he mumbled shamefacedly. \"Very good,\" said Dumbledore. \"Now, you will remember, I hope, that I told you at the very outset of these meetings of ours that we would be entering the realms of guesswork and speculation?\" \"Yes, sir\". \"Thus far, as I hope you agree, I have shown you reasonably firm sources of fact for my deductions as to what Voldemort did until the age of seventeen?\" Harry nodded. \"But now, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, \"now things become murkier and stranger. If it was difficult to find evidence about the boy Riddle, it has been almost impossible to find anyone prepared to reminisce about the man Voldemort. In fact, I doubt whether there is a soul alive, apart from himself, who could give us a full account of his life since he left Hogwarts. However, I have two last memories that I would like to share with you.\" Dumbledore indicated the two little crystal bottles gleaming beside the Pensieve. \"I shall then be glad of your opinion as to whether the conclusions I have drawn from them seem likely.\" The idea that Dumbledore valued his opinion this highly made Harry feel even more deeply ashamed that he had failed in the task of retrieving the Horcrux memory, and he shifted guiltily in his seat as Dumbledore raised the first of the two bottles to the light and examined it. \"I hope you are not tired of diving into other people's memories, for they are curious recollections, these two,\" he said. \"This first one came from a very old house-elf by the name of Hokey. Before we see what Hokey witnessed, I must quickly recount how Lord Voldemort left Hogwarts. \"He reached the seventh year of his schooling with, as you might have expected, top grades in every examination he had taken. All around him, his classmates were deciding which jobs they were to pursue once they had left Hogwarts. Nearly everybody expected spectacular things from Tom Riddle, prefect, Head Boy, winner of the Award for Special Services to the School. I know that several teachers, Professor Slughorn amongst them, suggested that he join the Ministry of Magic, offered to set up appointments, put him in touch with useful contacts. He refused all offers. The next thing the staff knew, Voldemort was working at Borgin and Burkes.\" \"At Borgin and Burkes?\" Harry repeated, stunned. \"At Borgin and Burkes,\" repeated Dumbledore calmly. \"I think you will see what attractions the place held for him when we have entered Hokey's memory. But this was not Voldemort's first choice of job. Hardly anyone knew of it at the time -- I was one of the few in whom the then headmaster confided -- but Voldemort first approached Professor Dippet and asked whether he could remain at Hogwarts as a teacher.\" \"He wanted to stay here? Why?\" asked Harry, more amazed still. \"I believe he had several reasons, though he confided none of them to Professor Dippet,\" said Dumbledore. \"Firstly, and very importantly, Voldemort was, I believe, more attached to this school than he has ever been to a person. Hogwarts was where he had been happiest; the first and only place he had felt at home.\" Harry felt slightly uncomfortable at these words, for this was exactly how he felt about Hogwarts too. \"Secondly, the castle is a stronghold of ancient magic. Undoubtedly Voldemort had penetrated many more of its secrets than most of the students who pass through the place, but he may have felt that there were still mysteries to unravel, stores of magic to tap. \"And thirdly, as a teacher, he would have had great power and influence over young witches and wizards. Perhaps he had gained the idea from Professor Slughorn, the teacher with whom he was on best terms, who had demonstrated how influential a role a teacher can play. I do not imagine for an instant that Voldemort envisaged spending the rest of his life at Hogwarts, but I do think that he saw it as a useful recruiting ground, and a place where he might begin to build himself an army.\" \"But he didn't get the job, sir?\" \"No, he did not. Professor Dippet told him that he was too young at eighteen, but invited him to reapply in a few years, if he still wished to teach.\" \"How did you feel about that, sir?\" asked Harry hesitantly. \"Deeply uneasy,\" said Dumbledore. \"I had advised Armando against the appointment -- I did not give the reasons I have given you, for Professor Dippet was very fond of Voldemort and convinced of his honesty. But I did not want Lord Voldemort back at this school, and especially not in a position of power.\" \"Which job did he want, sir? What subject did he want to teach?\" Somehow, Harry knew the answer even before Dumbledore gave it. \"Defense Against the Dark Arts. It was being taught at the time by an old Professor by the name of Galatea Merrythought, who had been at Hogwarts for nearly fifty years. \"So Voldemort went off to Borgin and Burkes, and all the staff who had admired him said what a waste it was, a brilliant young wizard like that, working in a shop. However, Voldemort was no mere assistant. Polite and handsome and clever, he was soon given particular jobs of the type that only exist in a place like Borgin and Burkes, which specializes, as you know, Harry, in objects with unusual and powerful properties. Voldemort was sent to persuade people to part with their treasures for sale by the partners, and he was, by all accounts, unusually gifted at doing this.\" \"I'll bet he was,\" said Harry, unable to contain himself. \"Well, quite,\" said Dumbledore, with a faint smile. \"And now it is time to hear from Hokey the house-elf, who worked for a very old, very rich witch by the name of Hepzibah Smith.\" Dumbledore tapped a bottle with his wand, the cork flew out, and he tipped the swirling memory into the Pensieve, saying as he did so, \"After you, Harry.\" Harry got to his feet and bent once more over the rippling silver contents of the stone basin until his face touched them. He tumbled through dark nothingness and landed in a sitting room in front of an immensely fat old lady wearing an elaborate ginger wig and a brilliant pink set of robes that flowed all around her, giving her the look of a melting iced cake. She was looking into a small jeweled mirror and dabbing rouge onto her already scarlet cheeks with a large powder puff, while the tiniest and oldest house-elf Harry had ever seen laced her fleshy feet into tight satin slippers. \"Hurry up, Hokey!\" said Hepzibah imperiously. \"He said he'd come at four, it's only a couple of minutes to and he's never been late yet!\" She tucked away her powder puff as the house-elf straightened up. The top of the elf's head barely reached the seat of Hepzibah's chair, and her papery skin hung off her frame just like the crisp linen sheet she wore draped like a toga. \"How do I look?\" said Hepzibah, turning her head to admire the various angles of her face in the mirror. \"Lovely, madam,\" squeaked Hokey. Harry could only assume that it was down in Hokey’s contract that she must lie through her teeth when asked this question, because Hepzibah Smith looked a long way from lovely in his opinion. A tinkling doorbell rang and both mistress and elf jumped. \"Quick, quick, he's here, Hokey!\" cried Hepzibah and the elf scurried out of the room, which was so crammed with objects that it was difficult to see how anybody could navigate their way across it without knocking over at least a dozen things: There were cabinets full of little lacquered boxes, cases full of gold-embossed books, shelves of orbs and celestial globes, and many flourishing potted plants in brass containers. In fact, the room looked like a cross between a magical antique shop and a conservatory. The house-elf returned within minutes, followed by a tall young man Harry had no difficulty whatsoever in recognizing as Voldemort. He was plainly dressed in a black suit; his hair was a little longer than it had been at school and his cheeks were hollowed, but all of this suited him; he looked more handsome than ever. He picked his way through the cramped room with an air that showed he had visited many times before and bowed low over Hepzibah's fat little hand, brushing it with his lips. \"I brought you flowers,\" he said quietly, producing a bunch of roses from nowhere. \"You naughty boy, you shouldn't have!\" squealed old Hepzibah, though Harry noticed that she had an empty vase standing ready on the nearest little table. \"You do spoil this old lady, Tom. ... Sit down, sit down. . . . Where's Hokey? Ah ...\" The house-elf had come dashing back into the room carrying a tray of little cakes, which she set at her mistress's elbow. \"Help yourself, Tom,\" said Hepzibah, \"I know how you love my cakes. Now, how are you? You look pale. They overwork you at that shop, I've said it a hundred times. ...\" Voldemort smiled mechanically and Hepzibah simpered. \"Well, what's your excuse for visiting this time?\" she asked, bat-ring her lashes. \"Mr. Burke would like to make an improved offer for the goblin-made armor,\" said Voldemort. \"Five hundred Galleons, he feels it is a more than fair --\" \"Now, now, not so fast, or I’ll think you're only here for my trinkets!\" pouted Hepzibah. \"I am ordered here because of them,\" said Voldemort quietly. \"I am only a poor assistant, madam, who must do as he is told. Mr. Burke wishes me to inquire --\" \"Oh, Mr. Burke, phooey!\" said Hepzibah, waving a little hand. \"I've something to show you that I've never shown Mr. Burke! Can you keep a secret, Tom? Will you promise you won't tell Mr. Burke I've got it? He'd never let me rest if he knew I'd shown it to you, and I'm not selling, not to Burke, not to anyone! But you, Tom, you'll appreciate it for its history, not how many Galleons you can get for it.\" \"I'd be glad to see anything Miss Hepzibah shows me,\" said Voldemort quietly, and Hepzibah gave another girlish giggle. \"I had Hokey bring it out for me . . . Hokey, where are you? I want to show Mr. Riddle our finest treasure. ... In fact, bring both, while you're at it. ...\" \"Here, madam,\" squeaked the house-elf, and Harry saw two leather boxes, one on top of the other, moving across the room as if of their own volition, though he knew the tiny elf was holding them over her head as she wended her way between tables, ***pouffes, and footstools. \"Now,\" said Hepzibah happily, taking the boxes from the elf, laying them in her lap, and preparing to open the topmost one, \"I think you'll like this, Tom. . . . Oh, if my family knew I was showing you. . . . They can't wait to get their hands on this!\" She opened the lid. Harry edged forward a little to get a better view and saw what looked like a small golden cup with two finely wrought handles. \"I wonder whether you know what it is, Tom? Pick it up, have a good look!\" whispered Hepzibah, and Voldemort stretched out a long-fingered hand and lifted the cup by one handle out of its snug silken wrappings. Harry thought he saw a red gleam in his dark eyes. His greedy expression was curiously mirrored on Hepzibah’s face, except that her tiny eyes were fixed upon Voldemort's handsome features. \"A badger,\" murmured Voldemort, examining the engraving upon the cup. \"Then this was . . . ?\" \"Helga Hufflepuff's, as you very well know, you clever boy!\" said Hepzibah, leaning forward with a loud creaking of corsets and actually pinching his hollow cheek. \"Didn't I tell you I was distantly descended? This has been handed down in the family for years and years. Lovely, isn't it? And all sorts of powers it's supposed to possess too, but I haven't tested them thoroughly, I just keep it nice and safe in here. . . .\" She hooked the cup back off Voldemort's long forefinger and restored it gently to its box, too intent upon settling it carefully back into position to notice the shadow that crossed Voldemort's face as the cup was taken away. \"Now then,\" said Hepzibah happily, \"where’s Hokey? Oh yes, there you are -- take that away now, Hokey.\" The elf obediently took the boxed cup, and Hepzibah turned her attention to the much flatter box in her lap. \"I think you'll like this even more, Tom,\" she whispered. \"Lean in a little, dear boy, so you can see. . . . Of course, Burke knows I've got this one, I bought it from him, and I daresay he'd love to get it back when I'm gone. ...\" She slid back the fine filigree clasp and flipped open the box. There upon the smooth crimson velvet lay a heavy golden locket. Voldemort reached out his hand, without invitation this time, and held it up to the light, staring at it. \"Slytherin's mark,\" he said quietly, as the light played upon an ornate, serpentine S. \"That's right!\" said Hepzibah, delighted, apparently, at the sight of Voldemort gazing at her locket, transfixed. \"I had to pay an arm and a leg for it, but I couldn't let it pass, not a real treasure like that, had to have it for my collection. Burke bought it, apparently, from a ragged-looking woman who seemed to have stolen it, but had no idea of its true value --\" There was no mistaking it this time: Voldemort's eyes flashed scarlet at the words, and Harry saw his knuckles whiten on the locket's chain. \"-- I daresay Burke paid her a pittance but there you are. . . . Pretty, isn't it? And again, all kinds of powers attributed to it, though I just keep it nice and safe. . . .\" She reached out to take the locket back. For a moment, Harry thought Voldemort was not going to let go of it, but then it had slid through his fingers and was back in its red velvet cushion. \"So there you are, Tom, clear, and I hope you enjoyed that!\" She looked him full in the face and for the first time, Harry saw her foolish smile falter. \"Are you all right, dear?\" \"Oh yes,\" said Voldemort quietly. \"Yes, I'm very well. ...\" \"I thought -- but a trick of the light, I suppose --\" said Hepzibah, looking unnerved, and Harry guessed that she too had seen the momentary red gleam in Voldemort's eyes. \"Here, Hokey, take these away and lock them up again. ... The usual enchantments... \"Time to leave, Harry,\" said Dumbledore quietly, and as the in tie elf bobbed away bearing the boxes, Dumbledore grasped Harry once again above the elbow and together they rose up through oblivion and back to Dumbledore's office. \"Hepzibah Smith died two days after that little scene,\" said Dumbledore, resuming his seat and indicating that Harry should do the same. \"Hokey the house-elf was convicted by the Ministry of poisoning her mistress's evening cocoa by accident.\" \"No way!\" said Harry angrily. \"I see we are of one mind,\" said Dumbledore. \"Certainly, then are many similarities between this death and that of the Riddles. In both cases, somebody else took the blame, someone who had a clear memory of having caused the death --\" \"Hokey confessed?\" \"She remembered putting something in her mistress's cocoa that turned out not to be sugar, but a lethal and little-known poison, said Dumbledore. \"It was concluded that she had not meant to do it, but being old and confused --\" \"Voldemort modified her memory, just like he did with Morfin!\" \"Yes, that is my conclusion too,\" said Dumbledore. \"And, just as with Morfin, the Ministry was predisposed to suspect Hokey --\" \"-- because she was a house-elf,\" said Harry. He had rarely felt more in sympathy with the society Hermione had set up, S.P.E.W. \"Precisely,\" said Dumbledore. \"She was old, she admitted to having tampered with the drink, and nobody at the Ministry bothered to inquire further. As in the case of Morfin, by the time I traced her and managed to extract this memory, her life was almost over -- but her memory, of course, proves nothing except that Voldemort knew of the existence of the cup and the locket. \"By the time Hokey was convicted, Hepzibah's family had realized that two of her greatest treasures were missing. It took them a while to be sure of this, for she had many hiding places, having always guarded her collection most jealously. But before they were sure beyond doubt that the cup and the locket were both gone, the assistant who had worked at Borgin and Burkes, the young man who had visited Hepzibah so regularly and charmed her so well, had resigned his post and vanished. His superiors had no idea where he had gone; they were as surprised as anyone at his disappearance. And that was the last that was seen or heard of Tom Riddle for a very long time. \"Now,\" said Dumbledore, \"if you don't mind, Harry, I want to pause once more to draw your attention to certain points of our story. Voldemort had committed another murder; whether it was his first since he killed the Riddles, I do not know, but I think it was. This time, as you will have seen, he killed not for revenge, but for gain. He wanted the two fabulous trophies that poor, besotted, old woman showed him. Just as he had once robbed the other children at his orphanage, just as he had stolen his Uncle Morfin’s ring, so he ran off now with Hepzibahs cup and locket.\" \"But,\" said Harry, frowning, \"it seems mad. . . . Risking everything, throwing away his job, just for those . . .\" \"Mad to you, perhaps, but not to Voldemort,\" said Dumbledore. \"I hope you will understand in due course exactly what those objects meant to him, Harry, but you must admit that it is not difficult to imagine that he saw the locket, at least, as rightfully his.\" \"The locket maybe,\" said Harry, \"but why take the cup as well?\" \"It had belonged to another of Hogwarts’s founders,\" said Dumbledore. \"I think he still felt a great pull toward the school and that he could not resist an object so steeped in Hogwarts history. There were other reasons, I think. ... I hope to be able to demonstrate them to you in due course. \"And now for the very last recollection I have to show you, at least until you manage to retrieve Professor Slughorn's memory for us. Ten years separates Hokey’s memory and this one, ten years during which we can only guess at what Lord Voldemort was doing. . . .\" Harry got to his feet once more as Dumbledore emptied the last memory into the Pensieve. \"Whose memory is it?\" he asked. \"Mine,\" said Dumbledore. And Harry dived after Dumbledore through the shifting silver mass, landing in the very office he had just left. There was Fawkes slumbering happily on his perch, and there behind the desk was Dumbledore, who looked very similar to the Dumbledore standing beside Harry, though both hands were whole and undamaged and his face was, perhaps, a little less lined. The one difference between the present-day office and this one was that it was snowing in the past; bluish flecks were drifting past the window in the dark and building up on the outside ledge. The younger Dumbledore seemed to be waiting for something, and sure enough, moments after their arrival, there was a knock on the door and he said, \"Enter.\" Harry let out a hastily stifled gasp. Voldemort had entered the room. His features were not those Harry had seen emerge from the great stone cauldron almost two years ago: They were not as snake-like, the eyes were not yet scarlet, the face not yet masklike, and yet he was no longer handsome Tom Riddle. It was as though his features had been burned and blurred; they were waxy and oddly distorted, and the whites of the eyes now had a permanently bloody look, though the pupils were not yet the slits that Harry knew they would become. He was wearing a long black cloak, and his face was as pale as the snow glistening on his shoulders. The Dumbledore behind the desk showed no sign of surprise. Evidently this visit had been made by appointment. \"Good evening, Tom,\" said Dumbledore easily. \"Won't you sit down?\" \"Thank you,\" said Voldemort, and he took the seat to which Dumbledore had gestured -- the very seat, by the looks of it, that Harry had just vacated in the present. \"I heard that you had become headmaster,\" he said, and his voice was slightly higher and colder than it had been. \"A worthy choice.\" \"I am glad you approve,\" said Dumbledore, smiling. \"May I offer you a drink?\" \"That would be welcome,\" said Voldemort. \"I have come a long way.\" Dumbledore stood and swept over to the cabinet where he now kept the Pensieve, but which then was full of bottles. Having handed Voldemort a goblet of wine and poured one for himself, he returned to the seat behind his desk. . \"So, Tom ... to what do I owe the pleasure?\" Voldemort did not answer at once, but merely sipped his wine. \"They do not call me 'Tom' anymore,\" he said. \"These days, 1 am known as --\" \"I know what you are known as,\" said Dumbledore, smiling, pleasantly. \"But to me, I'm afraid, you will always be Tom Riddle. It is one of the irritating things about old teachers. I am afraid that they never quite forget their charges' youthful beginnings.\" He raised his glass as though toasting Voldemort, whose face remained expressionless. Nevertheless, Harry felt the atmosphere in the room change subtly: Dumbledore's refusal to use Voldemort’s chosen name was a refusal to allow Voldemort to dictate the terms of the meeting, and Harry could tell that Voldemort took it as such. \"I am surprised you have remained here so long,\" said Voldemort after a short pause. \"I always wondered why a wizard such as yourself never wished to leave school.\" \"Well,\" said Dumbledore, still smiling, \"to a wizard such as myself, there can be nothing more important than passing on ancient skills, helping hone young minds. If I remember correctly, you once saw the attraction of teaching too.\" \"I see it still,\" said Voldemort. \"I merely wondered why you -- who are so often asked for advice by the Ministry, and who have twice, I think, been offered the post of Minister --\" \"Three times at the last count, actually,\" said Dumbledore. \"But the Ministry never attracted me as a career. Again, something we have in common, I think.\" Voldemort inclined his head, unsmiling, and took another sip of wine. Dumbledore did not break the silence that stretched between them now, but waited, with a look of pleasant expectancy, for Voldemort to talk first. \"I have returned,\" he said, after a little while, \"later, perhaps, than Professor Dippet expected . . . but I have returned, nevertheless, to request again what he once told me I was too young to have. I have come to you to ask that you permit me to return to this castle, to teach. I think you must know that I have seen and done much since I left this place. I could show and tell your students things they can gain from no other wizard.\" Dumbledore considered Voldemort over the top of his own goblet for a while before speaking. \"Yes, I certainly do know that you have seen and done much since leaving us,\" he said quietly. \"Rumors of your doings have reached your old school, Tom. I should be sorry to believe half of them.\" Voldemort's expression remained impassive as he said, \"Greatness inspires envy, envy engenders spite, spite spawns lies. You must know this, Dumbledore.\" \"You call it 'greatness,' what you have been doing, do you?\" asked Dumbledore delicately. \"Certainly,\" said Voldemort, and his eyes seemed to burn red. \"I have experimented; I have pushed the boundaries of magic further, perhaps, than they have ever been pushed --\" \"Of some kinds of magic,\" Dumbledore corrected him quietly. \"Of some. Of others, you remain . . . forgive me . . . woefully ignorant.\" For the first time, Voldemort smiled. It was a taut leer, an evil thing, more threatening than a look of rage. \"The old argument,\" he said softly. \"But nothing I have seen in the world has supported your famous pronouncements that love is more powerful than my kind of magic, Dumbledore.\" \"Perhaps you have been looking in the wrong places,\" suggested Dumbledore. \"Well, then, what better place to start my fresh researches than here, at Hogwarts?\" said Voldemort. \"Will you let me return? Will you let me share my knowledge with your students? I place myself and my talents at your disposal. I am yours to command.\" Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. \"And what will become of those whom you command? What will happen to those who call themselves -- or so rumor has it -- the Death Eaters?\" Harry could tell that Voldemort had not expected Dumbledore to know this name; he saw Voldemort’s eyes flash red again and the slitlike nostrils flare. \"My friends,\" he said, after a moment's pause, \"will carry on without me, I am sure.\" \"I am glad to hear that you consider them friends,\" said Dumbledore. \"I was under the impression that they are more in the order of servants.\" \"You are mistaken,\" said Voldemort. \"Then if I were to go to the Hog's Head tonight, I would not find a group of them -- Nott, Rosier, Muldber, Dolohov -- awaiting your return? Devoted friends indeed, to travel this far with you on a snowy night, merely to wish you luck as you attempted to secure a teaching post.\" There could be no doubt that Dumbledore's detailed knowledge of those with whom he was traveling was even less welcome to Voldemort; however, he rallied almost at once. \"You are omniscient as ever, Dumbledore.\" \"Oh no, merely friendly with the local barmen,\" said Dumbledore lightly. \"Now, Tom . . .\" Dumbledore set down his empty glass and drew himself up in his seat, the tips of his fingers together in a very characteristic gesture. \"Let us speak openly. Why have you come here tonight, surrounded by henchmen, to request a job we both know you do not want?\" Voldemort looked coldly surprised. \"A job I do not want? On the contrary, Dumbledore, I want it very much.\" \"Oh, you want to come back to Hogwarts, but you do not want to teach any more than you wanted to when you were eighteen. What is it you're after, Tom? Why not try an open request for once?\" Voldemort sneered. \"If you do not want to give me a job --\" \"Of course I don't,\" said Dumbledore. \"And I don't think for a moment you expected me to. Nevertheless, you came here, you asked, you must have had a purpose.\" Voldemort stood up. He looked less like Tom Riddle than ever, his features thick with rage. \"This is your final word?\" \"It is,\" said Dumbledore, also standing. \"Then we have nothing more to say to each other.\" \"No, nothing,\" said Dumbledore, and a great sadness filled his face. \"The time is long gone when I could frighten you with a burning wardrobe and force you to make repayment for your crimes. But I wish I could, Tom. ... I wish I could. . . .\" For a second, Harry was on the verge of shouting a pointless warning: He was sure that Voldemort's hand had twitched toward his pocket and his wand; but then the moment had passed, Voldemort had turned away, the door was closing, and he was gone. Harry felt Dumbledore's hand close over his arm again and moments later, they were standing together on almost the same spot, but there was no snow building on the window ledge, and Dumbledore's hand was blackened and dead-looking once more. \"Why?\" said Harry at once, looking up into Dumbledore's face. \"Why did he come back? Did you ever find out?\" \"I have ideas,\" said Dumbledore, \"but no more than that.\" \"What ideas, sir?\" \"I shall tell you, Harry, when you have retrieved that memory from Professor Slughorn,\" said Dumbledore. \"When you have that last piece of the jigsaw, everything will, I hope, be clear ... to both of us.\" Harry was still burning with curiosity and even though Dumbledore had walked to the door and was holding it open for him, he did not move at once. \"Was he after the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again, sir? He didn't say. ...\" \"Oh, he definitely wanted the Defense Against the Dark Arts job,\" said Dumbledore. \"The aftermath of our little meeting proved that. You see, we have never been able to keep a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher for longer than a year since I refused the post to Lord Voldemort.\" \n",

            ": The Unknowable Room Harry wracked his brains over the next week as to how he was to persuade Slughorn to hand over the true memory, but nothing in the nature of a brain wave occurred and he was reduced to doing what he did increasingly these days when at a loss: poring over his Potions book, hoping that the Prince would have scribbled something useful in a margin, as he had done so many times before. \"You won't find anything in there,\" said Hermione firmly, late on Sunday evening. \"Don't start, Hermione,\" said Harry. \"If it hadn't been for the Prince, Ron wouldn't be sitting here now.\" \"He would if you'd just listened to Snape in our first year,\" said Hermione dismissively. Harry ignored her. He had just found an incantation \"Sectum-sempra!\" scrawled in a margin above the intriguing words \"For enemies,\" and was itching to try it out, but thought it best not to in front of Hermione. Instead, he surreptitiously folded down the corner of the page. They were sitting beside the fire in the common room; the only other people awake were fellow sixth years. There had been a cer-tain amount of excitement earlier when they had come back from dinner to find a new sign on the notice board that announced the date for their Apparition Test. Those who would be seventeen on or before the first test date, the twenty-first of April, had the option of signing up for additional practice sessions, which would take place (heavily supervised) in Hogsmeade. Ron had panicked on reading this notice; he had still not man-aged to Apparate and feared he would not be ready for the test. Hermione, who had now achieved Apparition twice, was a little more confident, but Harry, who would not be seventeen for an-other four months, could not take the test whether ready or not. \"At least you can Apparate, though!\" said Ron tensely. \"You'll have no trouble come July!\" \"I've only done it once,\" Harry reminded him; he had finally managed to disappear and rematerialize inside his hoop during their previous lesson. Having wasted a lot of time worrying aloud about Apparition, Ron was now struggling to finish a viciously difficult essay for Snape that Harry and Hermione had already completed. Harry fully expected to receive low marks on his, because he had disagreed with Snape on the best way to tackle dementors, but he did not care: Slughorns memory was the most important thing to him now. \"I'm telling you, the stupid Prince isn't going to be able to help you with this, Harry!\" said Hermione, more loudly. \"There's only one way to force someone to do what you want, and that's the Imperius Curse, which is illegal --\" \"Yeah, I know that, thanks,\" said Harry, not looking up from the book. \"That's why I'm looking for something different. Dumbledorf says Veritaserum won't do it, but there might be something else, a potion or a spell. . . .\" \"You're going about it the wrong way,\" said Hermione. \"Only you can get the memory, Dumbledore says. That must mean you can persuade Slughorn where other people can’t. It's not a question of slipping him a potion, anyone could do that --\" \"How do you spell 'belligerent'?\" said Ron, shaking his quill very hard while staring at his parchment. \"It can't be B -- U -- M --\" \"No, it isn't,\" said Hermione, pulling Ron's essay toward her. \"And 'augury' doesn't begin O -- R -- G either. What kind of quill are you using?\" \"It's one of Fred and George's Spell-Check ones, but I think the charm must be wearing off.\" \"Yes, it must,\" said Hermione, pointing at the title of his essay, \"because we were asked how we'd deal with dementors, not 'Dug-bogs', and I don't remember you changing your name to 'Roonil Wazlib’ either.\" \"Ah no!\" said Ron, staring horror-struck at the parchment. \"Don't say I'll have to write the whole thing out again!\" \"It's okay, we can fix it,\" said Hermione, pulling the essay toward her and taking out her wand. \"I love you, Hermione,\" said Ron, sinking back in his chair, rub-bing his eyes wearily. Hermione turned faintly pink, but merely said, \"Don't let Lavender hear you saying that.\" \"1 won't,\" said Ron into his hands. \"Or maybe I will, then she'll ditch me.\" \"Why don't you ditch her if you want to finish it?\" asked Harry. \"You haven't ever chucked anyone, have you?\" said Ron. \"You and Cho just --\" \"Sort of fell apart, yeah,\" said Harry. \"Wish that would happen with me and Lavender,\" said Ron gloomily, watching Hermione silently tapping each of his mis-spelled words with the end of her wand, so that they corrected themselves on the page. \"But the more I hint I want to finish it, the tighter she holds on. It's like going out with the giant squid.\" \"There,\" said Hermione, some twenty minutes later, handing back Ron's essay. \"Thanks a million,\" said Ron. \"Can I borrow your quill for the conclusion?\" Harry, who had found nothing useful in the Half-Blood Prince's notes so far, looked around; the three of them were now the only ones left in the common room, Seamus having just gone up to bed cursing Snape and his essay. The only sounds were the crackling of the fire and Ron scratching out one last paragraph on dementors using Hermione's quill. Harry had just closed the Half-Blood Prince's book, yawning, when -- Crack! Hermione let out a little shriek; Ron spilled ink all over his freshly completed essay, and Harry said, \"Kreacher!\" The house-elf bowed low and addressed his own gnarled toes. \"Master said he wanted regular reports on what the Malfoy boy is doing, so Kreacher has come to give--\" Crack! Dobby appeared alongside Kreacher, his tea-cozy hat askew. \"Dobby has been helping too, Harry Potter!\" he squeaked, cast-ing Kreacher a resentful look. \"And Kreacher ought to tell Dobby when he is coming to see Harry Potter so they can make their re-ports together!\" \"What is this?\" asked Hermione, still looking shocked by these sudden appearances. \"What's going on, Harry?\" Harry hesitated before answering, because he had not told Her-mione about setting Kreacher and Dobby to tail Malfoy; house-elves were always such a touchy subject with her. \"Well. . . they've been following Malfoy for me,\" he said. \"Night and day,\" croaked Kreacher. \"Dobby has not slept for a week, Harry Potter!\" said Dobby proudly, swaying where he stood. Hermione looked indignant. \"You haven't slept, Dobby? But surely, Harry, you didn't tell him not to --\" \"No, of course I didn't,\" said Harry quickly. \"Dobby, you can sleep, all right? But has either of you found out anything?\" he has-tened to ask, before Hermione could intervene again. \"Master Malfoy moves with a nobility that befits his pure blood,\" croaked Kreacher at once. \"His features recall the fine bones of my mistress and his manners are those of--\" \"Draco Malfoy is a bad boy!\" squeaked Dobby angrily. \"A bad boy who -- who --\" He shuddered from the tassel of his tea cozy to the toes of his socks and then ran at the fire, as though about to dive into it. Harry, to whom this was not entirely unexpected, caught him around the middle and held him fast. For a few seconds Dobby struggled, then went limp. \"Thank you, Harry Potter,\" he panted. \"Dobby still finds it dif-ficult to speak ill of his old masters.\" Harry released him; Dobby straightened his tea cozy and said defiantly to Kreacher, \"But Kreacher should know that Draco Malfoy is not a good master to a house-elf!\" \"Yeah, we don't need to hear about you being in love with Malfoy,\" Harry told Kreacher. \"Let's fast forward to where he's actually been going.\" Kreacher bowed again, looking furious, and then said, \"Master Malfoy eats in the Great Hall, he sleeps in a dormitory in the dun-geons, he attends his classes in a variety of--\" \"Dobby, you tell me,\" said Harry, cutting across Kreacher. \"Has he been going anywhere he shouldn't have?\" \"Harry Potter, sir,\" squeaked Dobby, his great orblike eyes shining in the firelight, \"the Malfoy boy is breaking no rules that Dobby can discover, but he is still keen to avoid detection. He has been making regular visits to the seventh floor with a variety of other students, who keep watch for him while he enters --\" \"The Room of Requirement!\" said Harry, smacking himself hard on the forehead with Advanced Potion-Making. Hermione and Ron stared at him. \"That's where he's been sneaking off to! That's where he's doing... whatever he's doing! And I bet that's why he's been disappearing off the map -- come to think of it, I've never seen the Room of Requirement on there!\" \"Maybe the Marauders never knew the room was there,\" said Ron. \"I think it'll be part of the magic of the room,\" said Hermione. \"If you need it to be unplottable, it will be.\" \"Dobby, have you managed to get in to have a look at what Malfoy's doing?\" said Harry eagerly. \"No, Harry Potter, that is impossible,\" said Dobby. \"No, it's not,\" said Harry at once. \"Malfoy got into our head-quarters there last year, so I'll be able to get in and spy on him, no problem.\" \"But I don't think you will, Harry,\" said Hermione slowly. \"Mal-foy already knew exactly how we were using the room, didn't he, because that stupid Marietta had blabbed. He needed the room to become the headquarters of the D.A., so it did. But you don't know what the room becomes when Malfoy goes in there, so you don't know what to ask it to transform into.\" \"There'll be a way around that,\" said Harry dismissively. \"You've done brilliantly, Dobby.\" \"Kreachers done well too,\" said Hermione kindly; but far from looking grateful, Kreacher averted his huge, bloodshot eyes and croaked at the ceiling, \"The Mudblood is speaking to Kreacher, Kreacher will pretend he cannot hear --\" \"Get out of it,\" Harry snapped at him, and Kreacher made one last deep bow and Disapparated. \"You'd better go and get some sleep too, Dobby.\" \"Thank you, Harry Potter, sir!\" squeaked Dobby happily, and he too vanished. \"How good is this?\" said Harry enthusiastically, turning to Ron and Hermione the moment the room was elf-free again. \"We know where Malfoy's going! We've got him cornered now!\" \"Yeah, it's great,\" said Ron glumly, who was attempting to mop up the sodden mass of ink chat had recently been an almost com-pleted essay. Hermione pulled it toward her and began siphoning the ink off with her wand. \"But what's all this about him going up there with a variety of students'?\" said Hermione. \"How many people are in on it? You wouldn't think he'd trust lots of them to know what he's do-ing---\" \"Yeah, that is weird,\" said Harry, frowning. \"I heard him telling Crabbe it wasn't Crabbe's business what he was doing... so what's he telling all these... all these...\" Harry's voice tailed away; he was staring at the fire. \"God, I've been stupid,\" he said quietly. \"Its obvious, isn't it? There was a great vat of it down in the dungeon. . . . He could’ve nicked some any time during that lesson. . . .\" \"Nicked what?\" said Ron. \"Polyjuice Potion. He stole some of the Polyjuice Potion Slug-horn showed us in our first Potions lesson... There aren't a whole variety of students standing guard for Malfoy... it's just Crabbe and Goyle as usual. ...Yeah, it all fits!\" said Harry, jumping up and starting to pace in front of the fire. \"They're stupid enough to do what they're told even if he won't tell them what he's up to, but he doesn't want them to be seen lurking around outside the Room of Requirement, so he's got them taking Polyjuice to make them look like other people... Those two girls I saw him with when he missed Quidditch -- ha! Crabbe and Goyle!\" \"Do you mean to say,\" said Hermione in a hushed voice, \"that that little girl whose scales I repaired -- ?\" \"Yeah, of course!\" said Harry loudly, staring at her. \"Of course! Malfoy must've been inside the room at the time, so she -- what am I talking about? -- he dropped the scales to tell Malfoy not to corne out, because there was someone there! And there was that girl who dropped the toadspawn too! We've been walking past him all the time and not realizing it!\" \"He's got Crabbe and Goyle transforming into girls?\" guffawed Ron. \"Blimey... no wonder they don't look too happy these days. I'm surprised they don't tell him to stuff it.\" \"Well, they wouldn't, would they, if he's shown them his Dark Mark?\" said Harry. \"Hmmm... the Dark Mark we don't know exists,\" said Hermi-one skeptically, rolling up Ron's dried essay before it could come to any more harm and handing it to him. \"We'll see\" said Harry confidently. \"Yes, we will,\" Hermione said, getting to her feet and stretching. \"But, Harry, before you get all excited, I still don't think you'll be able to get into the Room of Requirement without knowing what's there first'. And I don't think you should forget\" -- she heaved her bag onto her shoulder and gave him a very serious look -- \"that what you're supposed to be concentrating on is getting that memory from Slughorn. Good night.\" Harry watched her go, feeling slightly disgruntled. Once the door to the girls' dormitories had closed behind her he rounded on Ron. \"What d'you think?\" \"Wish I could Disapparate like a house-elf,\" said Ron, staring at the spot where Dobby had vanished. \"I'd have that Apparition Test in the bag.\" Harry did not sleep well that night. He lay awake for what felt like hours, wondering how Malfoy was using the Room of Requirement and what he, Harry, would see when he went in there the following day, for whatever Hermione said, Harry was sure that if Malfoy had-=- been able to see the headquarters of the D.A., he would be able to see Malfoy's, what could it be? A meeting place? A hideout? A ston room? A workshop? Harrys mind worked feverishly and his dreams, when he finally fell asleep, were broken and disturbed by images of Malfoy, who turned into Slughorn, who turned into Snape... Harry was in a state of great anticipation over breakfast the following morning; he had a free period before Defense Against the Dark Arts and was determined to spend it trying to get into the Room of Requirement. Hermione was rather ostentatiously showing no interest in his whispered plans for forcing entry into the room, which irritated Harry, because he thought she might be a lot of help if she wanted to. \"Look,\" he said quietly, leaning forward and putting a hand on the Daily Prophet, which she had just removed from a post owl, to stop her from opening it and vanishing behind it. \"I haven't for-gotten about Slughorn, but I haven't got a clue how to get that memory off him, and until I get a brain wave why shouldn't I find out what Malfoy's doing?\" \"I've already told you, you need to persuade Slughorn,\" said Her-mione. \"It's not a question of tricking him or bewitching him, or Dumbledore could have done it in a second. Instead of messing around outside the Room of Requirement\" -- she jerked the Prophet out from under Harrys hand and unfolded it to look at the front page -- \"you should go and find Slughorn and start appeal-ing to his better nature.\" \"Anyone we know -- ?\" asked Ron, as Hermione scanned the headlines. \"Yes!\" said Hermione, causing both Harry and Ron to gag on their breakfast. \"But it's all right, he's not dead -- its Mundungus, he's been arrested and sent to Azkaban! Something to do with impersonating an Inferius during an attempted burglary, and someone called Octavius Pepper has vanished. Oh, and how horrible, a nine-year-old boy has been arrested for trying to kill his grandparents, they think he was under the Imperius Curse.\" They finished their breakfast in silence. Hermione set off imme-diately for Ancient Runes; Ron for the common room, where he still had to finish his conclusion on Snape's dementor essay, and Harry for the corridor on the seventh floor and the stretch of wall opposite the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy teaching trolls to do ballet. Harry slipped on his Invisibility Cloak once he had found an empty passage, but he need not have bothered. When he reached his destination he found it deserted. Harry was not sure whether his chances of getting inside the room were better with Malfoy in-side it or out, but at least his first attempt was not going to be complicated by the presence of Crabbe or Goyle pretending to be an eleven-year-old girl. He closed his eyes as he approached the place where the Room of Requirement's door was concealed. He knew what he had to do; he had become most accomplished at it last year. Concentrating with all his might he thought, \"I need to see what Malfoy's doing in here... I need to see what Malfoy's doing in here... I need to see what Malfoy's doing in here...\" Three times he walked past the door; then, his heart pounding with excitement, he opened his eyes and faced it -- but he was still looking at a stretch of mundanely blank wall. He moved forward and gave it an experimental push. The stone remained solid and unyielding. \"Okay,\" said Harry aloud. \"Okay... I thought the wrong thing...\" He pondered for a moment then set off again, eyes closed, con-centrating as hard as he could. \"I need to see the place where Malfoy keeps coming secretly... I need to see the place where Malfoy keeps coming secretly...\" After three walks past, he opened his eyes expectantly. There was no door. \"Oh, come off it,\" he told the wall irritably. \"That was a clear instruction. Fine.\" He thought hard for several minutes before striding off once more. \"I need you to become the place you become for Draco Malfoy...\" He did not immediately open his eyes when he had finished his patrolling; he was listening hard, as though he might hear the door pop into existence. He heard nothing, however, except the distant twittering of birds outside. He opened his eyes. There was still no door. Harry swore. Someone screamed. He looked around to see a gaggle of first years running back around the corner, apparently un-der the impression that they had just encountered a particularly foulmouthed ghost. Harry tried every variation of \"I need to see what Draco Malfoy is doing inside you\" that he could think of for a whole hour, at the end of which he was forced to concede that Hermione might have had a point: The room simply did not want to open for him. Frus-trated and annoyed, he set off for Defense Against the Dark Arts, pulling off his Invisibility Cloak and stuffing it into his bag as he went. \"Late again, Potter,\" said Snape coldly, as Harry hurried into the candlelit classroom. \"Ten points from Gryfrindor.\" Harry scowled at Snape as he flung himself into the seat beside Ron. Half the class were still on their feet, taking out books and orga-nizing their things; he could not be much later than any of them. \"Before we start, I want your dementor essays,\" said Snape, wav-ing his wand carelessly, so that twenty-five scrolls of parchment soared into the air and landed in a neat pile on his desk. \"And I hope for your sakes they are better than the tripe I had to endure on resisting the Imperius Curse. Now, if you will all open your books to page -- what is it, Mr. Finnigan?\" \"Sir,\" said Seamus, \"I've been wondering, how do you tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost? Because there was something in the paper about an Inferius --\" \"No, there wasn't,\" said Snape in a bored voice. \"But sir, I heard people talking --\" \"If you had actually read the article in question, Mr. Finnigan, you would have known that the so-called Inferius was nothing but a smelly sneak thief by the name of Mundungus Fletcher.\" \"I thought Snape and Mundungus were on the same side,\" mut-tered Harry to Ron and Hermione. \"Shouldn't he be upset Mun-dungus has been arrest --\" \"But Potter seems to have a lot to say on the subject,\" said Snape, pointing suddenly at the back of the room, his black eyes fixed on Harry. \"Let us ask Potter how we would tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost.\" The whole class looked around at Harry, who hastily tried to recall what Dumbledore had told him the night that they had gone to visit Slughorn. \"Er -- well -- ghosts are transparent --\" he said. \"Oh, very good,\" interrupted Snape, his lip curling. \"Yes, it in easy to see that nearly six years of magical education have not been wasted on you, Potter. 'Ghosts are transparent.\"' Pansy Parkinson let out a high-pitched giggle. Several other peo-ple were smirking. Harry took a deep breath and continued calmly, though his insides were boiling, \"Yeah, ghosts are transparent, but Inferi are dead bodies, aren't they? So they'd be solid --\" \"A five-year-old could have told us as much,\" sneered Snape. \"The Inferius is a corpse that has been reanimated by a Dark wiz-ard's spells. It is not alive, it is merely used like a puppet to do the wizard's bidding. A ghost, as I trust that you are all aware by now, is the imprint of a departed soul left upon the earth, and of course, as Potter so wisely tells us, transparent. \" \"Well, what Harry said is the most useful if we're trying to tell them apart!\" said Ron. \"When we come face-to-face with one down a dark alley, we're going to be having a look to see if its solid, aren't we, we're not going to be asking, 'Excuse me, are you the imprint of a departed soul?'\" There was a ripple of laughter, instantly quelled by the look Snape gave the class. \"Another ten points from Gryffindor,\" said Snape. \"I would ex-pect nothing more sophisticated from you, Ronald Weasley, the boy so solid he cannot Apparate half an inch across a room.\" \"No!\" whispered Hermione, grabbing Harrys arm as he opened his mouth furiously. \"There's no point, you'll just end up in deten-tion again, leave it!\" \"Now open your books to page two hundred and thirteen,\" said Snape, smirking a little, \"and read the first two paragraphs on the Cruciatus Curse.\" Ron was very subdued all through the class. When the bell sounded at the end of the lesson, Lavender caught up with Ron and Harry (Hermione mysteriously melted out of sight as she ap-proached) and abused Snape hotly for his jibe about Ron's Appari-tion, but this seemed to merely irritate Ron, and he shook her off by making a detour into the boys' bathroom with Harry. \"Snape's right, though, isn't he?\" said Ron, after staring into a cracked mirror for a minute or two. \"I dunno whether it's worth me taking the test. I just can't get the hang of Apparition.\" \"You might as well do the extra practice sessions in Hogsmeade and see where they get you,\" said Harry reasonably. \"It'll be more interesting than trying to get into a stupid hoop anyway. Then, if you're still not -- you know -- as good as you'd like to be, you can postpone the test, do it with me over the summer -- Myrtle, this is the boys' bathroom!\" The ghost of a girl had risen out of the toilet in a cubicle behind them and was now floating in midair, staring at them through thick, white, round glasses. \"Oh,\" she said glumly. \"It's you two.\" \"Who were you expecting?\" said Ron, looking at her in the mirror. \"Nobody,\" said Myrtle, picking moodily at a spot on her chin. \"He said he'd come back and see me, but then you said you'd pop in and visit me too\" -- she gave Harry a reproachful look -- \"and I haven't seen you for months and months. I've learned not to ex-pect too much from boys.\" \"I thought you lived in that girls' bathroom?\" said Harry, who had been careful to give the place a wide berth for some years now. \"I do,\" she said, with a sulky little shrug, \"but that doesn't mean I cant visit other places. I came and saw you in your bath once, remember?\" \"Vividly,\" said Harry. \"But I thought he liked me,\" she said plaintively. \"Maybe if you two left, he'd come back again. We had lots in common. I'm sure he felt it.\" And she looked hopefully toward the door. \"When you say you had lots in common,\" said Ron, sounding rather amused now, \"d'you mean he lives in an S-bend too?\" \"No,\" said Myrtle defiantly, her voice echoing loudly around the old tiled bathroom. \"I mean he's sensitive, people bully him too, and he feels lonely and hasn't got anybody to talk to, and he's not afraid to show his feelings and cry!\" \"There's been a boy in here crying?\" said Harry curiously. \"A young boy?\" \"Never you mind!\" said Myrtle, her small, leaky eyes fixed on Ron, who was now definitely grinning. \"I promised I wouldn't tell anyone, and I'll take his secret to the --\" \"-- not the grave, surely?\" said Ron with a snort. \"The sewers, maybe.\" Myrtle gave a howl of rage and dived back into the toilet, caus-ing water to slop over the sides and onto the floor. Goading Myrtle seemed to have put fresh heart into Ron. \"You're right,\" he said, swinging his schoolbag back over his shoulder, \"I'll do the practice sessions in Hogsmeade before I de-cide about taking the test.\" And so the following weekend, Ron joined Hermione and the rest of the sixth years who would turn seventeen in time to take the test in a fortnight. Harry felt rather jealous watching them all get ready to go into the village; he missed making trips there, and it was a particularly fine spring day, one of the first clear skies they had seen in a long time. However, he had decided to use the time to attempt another assault on the Room of Requirement. \"You'd do better,\" said Hermione, when he confided this plan to Ron and her in the entrance hall, \"to go straight to Slughorn's of-fice and try and get that memory from him.\" \"I've been trying!\" said Harry crossly, which was perfectly true. He had lagged behind after every Potions lesson that week in an at-tempt to corner Slughorn, but the Potions master always left the dungeon so fast that Harry had not been able to catch him. Twice, Harry had gone to his office and knocked, but received no reply, though on the second occasion he was sure he had heard the quickly stifled sounds of an old gramophone. \"He doesn't want to talk to me, Hermione! He can tell I've been trying to get him on his own again, and he's not going to let it happen!\" \"Well, you've just got to keep at it, haven't you?\" The short queue of people waiting to file past Filch, who was do-ing his usual prodding act with the Secrecy Sensor, moved forward a few steps and Harry did not answer in case he was overheard by the caretaker. He wished Ron and Hermione both luck, then turned and climbed the marble staircase again, determined, whatever Her-mione said, to devote an hour or two to the Room of Requirement. Once out of sight of the entrance hall, Harry pulled the Ma-rauder's Map and his Invisibility Cloak from his bag. Having concealed himself, he tapped the map, murmured, \"I solemnly swear that I am up to no good,\" and scanned it carefully. As it was Sunday morning, nearly all the students were inside their various common rooms, the Gryffindors in one tower, the Ravenclaws in another, the Slytherins in the dungeons, and the Hufflepuffs in the basement near the kitchens. Here and there a stray person meandered around the library or up a corridor. There were a few people out in the grounds, and there, alone in the seventh-floor corridor, was Gregory Goyle. There was no sign of the Room of Requirement, but Harry was not worried about that; if Goyle was standing guard outside it, the room was open, whether the map was aware of it or not. He therefore sprinted up the stairs, slowing down only when he reached the corner into the corridor, when he began to creep, very slowly, toward the very same little girl, clutching her heavy brass scales, that Hermione had so kindly helped a fortnight before. He waited until he was right be-hind her before bending very low and whispering, \"Hello...you're very pretty, aren't you?\" Goyle gave a high-pitched scream of terror, threw the scales up into the air, and sprinted away, vanishing from sight long before the sound of the scales smashing had stopped echoing around the corri-dor. Laughing, Harry turned to contemplate the blank wall behind which, he was sure, Draco Malfoy was now standing frozen, aware that someone unwelcome was out there, but not daring to make an appearance. It gave Harry a most agreeable feeling of power as he tried to remember what form of words he had not yet tried. Yet this hopeful mood did not last long. Half an hour later, hav-ing tried many more variations of his request to see what Malfoy was up to, the wall was just as doorless as ever. Harry felt frustrated beyond belief-=Malfoy might be just feet away from him, and there was still not the tiniest shred of evidence as to what he was doing in there. Losing his patience completely, Harry ran at the wall and kicked it. \"OUCH!\" He thought he might have broken his toe; as he clutched it and hopped on one foot, the Invisibility Cloak slipped off him. \"Harry?\" He spun around, one-legged, and toppled over. There, to his utter astonishment, was Tonks, walking toward him as though she frequently strolled up this corridor. \"What’re you doing here?\" he said, scrambling to his feet again; why did she always have to find him lying on the floor? \"I came to see Dumbledore,\" said Tonks. Harry thought she looked terrible: thinner than usual, her mouse-colored hair lank. \"His office isn't here,\" said Harry, \"it's round the other side of the castle, behind the gargoyle --\" \"I know,\" said Tonks. \"He's not there. Apparently he's gone away again.\" \"Has he?\" said Harry, putting his bruised foot gingerly back on the floor. \"Hey -- you don't know where he goes, I suppose?\" \"No,\" said Tonks. \"What did you want to see him about?\" \"Nothing in particular,\" said Tonks, picking, apparently uncon-sciously, at the sleeve of her robe. \"I just thought he might know what's going on. I've heard rumors... people getting hurt.\" \"Yeah, I know, it's all been in the papers,\" said Harry. \"That lit-tle kid trying to kill his --\" \"The Prophet's often behind the times,\" said Tonks, who didn't seem to be listening to him. \"You haven't had any letters from any-one in the Order recently?\" \"No one from the Order writes to me anymore,\" said Harry, \"not since Sirius --\" He saw that her eyes had filled with tears. \"I'm sorry,\" he muttered awkwardly. \"I mean... I miss him, as well.\" \"What?\" said Tonks blankly, as though she had not heard him. \"Well. I'll see you around, Harry.\" And she turned abruptly and walked back down the corridor, leaving Harry to stare after her. After a minute or so, he pulled the Invisibility Cloak on again and resumed his efforts to get into the Room of Requirement, but his heart was not in it. Finally, a hollow feeling in his stomach and the knowledge that Ron and Hermione would soon be back for lunch made him abandon the attempt and leave the corridor to Malfoy who, hopefully, would be too afraid to leave for some hours to come. He found Ron and Hermione in the Great Hall, already halfway through an early lunch. \"I did it -- well, kind of!\" Ron told Harry enthusiastically when he caught sight of him. \"I was supposed to be Apparating to out-side Madam Puddifoots Tea Shop and I overshot it a bit, ended up near Scrivenshafts, but at least I moved!\" \"Good one,\" said Harry. \"How'd you do, Hermione?\" \"Oh, she was perfect, obviously,\" said Ron, before Hermione could answer. \"Perfect deliberation, divination, and desperation or whatever the hell it is -- we all went for a quick drink in the Three Broomsticks after and you should've heard Twycross going on about her -- I'll be surprised if he doesn't pop the question soon --\" \"And what about you?\" asked Hermione, ignoring Ron. \"Have you been up at the Room of Requirement all this time?\" \"Yep,\" said Harry. \"And guess who I ran into up there? Tonks!\" \"Tonks?\" repeated Ron and Hermione together, looking surprised. \"Yeah, she said she'd come to visit Dumbledore.\" \"If you ask me,\" said Ron once Harry had finished describing his conversation with Tonks, \"she's cracking up a bit. Losing her nerve after what happened at the Ministry.\" \"It’s a bit odd,\" said Hermione, who for some reason looked very concerned. \"She's supposed to be guarding the school, why she suddenly abandoning her post to come and see Dumbledore when he's not even here?\" \"I had a thought,\" said Harry tentatively. He felt strange about voicing it; this was much more Hermione’s territory than his. \"You don't think she can have been... you know... in love with Sirius?\" Hermione stared at him. \"What on earth makes you say that?\" \"I dunno,\" said Harry, shrugging, \"but she was nearly crying when I mentioned his name, and her Patronus is a big four-legged thing now. I wondered whether it hadn't become... you know... him.\" \"It's a thought,\" said Hermione slowly. \"But I still don't know why she'd be bursting into the castle to see Dumbledore, if that's re-ally why she was here.\" \"Goes back to what I said, doesn't it?\" said Ron, who was now shoveling mashed potato into his mouth. \"She's gone a bit funny. Lost her nerve. Women,\" he said wisely to Harry, \"they're easily upset.\" \"And yet,\" said Hermione, coming out of her reverie, \"I doubt you'd find a woman who sulked for half an hour because Madam Rosmerta didn't laugh at their joke about the hag, the Healer, and the Mimbulus mimbletonia.\" Ron scowled. \n",

            ": AVeryFrosty Christmas \"So Snape was offering to help him? He was definitely offering to help him?\" \"If you ask. that once more,\" said Harry, \"I'm going to stick this sprout --\" \"I'm only checking!\" said Ron. They were standing alone at the Burrow's kitchen sink, peeling a mountain of sprouts for Mrs. Weasley. Snow was drifting past the window in front of them. \"Yes, Snape was offering to help him!\" said Harry. \"He said he'd promised Malfoy's mother to protect him, that he'd made an Un-breakable Oath or something --\" \"An Unbreakable Vow?\" said Ron, looking stunned. \"Nah, he can't have. . . . Are you sure?\" \"Yes, I'm sure,\" said Harry. \"Why, what does it mean?\" \"Well, you can't break an Unbreakable Vow. . . .\" \"I'd worked that much out for myself, funnily enough. What happens if you break it, then?\" \"You die,\" said Ron simply. \"Fred and George tried to get me to make one when I was about five. I nearly did too, I was holding hands with Fred and everything when Dad found us. He went mental,\" said Ron, with a reminiscent gleam in his eyes. \"Only time I've ever seen Dad as angry as Mum, Fred reckons his left but-tock has never been the same since.\" \"Yeah, well, passing over Fred's left buttock --\" \"I beg your pardon?\" said Fred's voice as the twins entered the kitchen. \"Aaah, George, look at this. They're using knives and everything. Bless them.\" \"I'll be seventeen in two and a bit months' time,\" said Ron grumpily, \"and then I'll be able to do it by magic!\" \"But meanwhile,\" said George, sitting down at the kitchen table and putting his feet up on it, \"we can enjoy watching you demon-strate the correct use of a -- whoops-a-daisy!\" \"You made me do that!\" said Ron angrily, sucking his cut thumb. \"You wait, when I'm seventeen --\" \"I'm sure you'll dazzle us all with hitherto unsuspected magical skills,\" yawned Fred. \"And speaking of hitherto unsuspected skills, Ronald,\" said George, \"what is this we hear from Ginny about you and a young lady called -- unless our information is faulty -- Lavender Brown?\" Ron turned a little pink, but did not look displeased as he turned back to the sprouts. \"Mind your own business.\" \"What a snappy retort,\" said Fred. \"I really don't know how you think of them. No, what we wanted to know was... how did it happen?\" \"What d'you mean?\" \"Did she have an accident or something?\" \"What?\" ..¦; \"Well, how did she sustain such extensive brain damage? Care-ful, now!\" Mrs. Weasley entered the room just in time to see Ron throw the sprout knife at Fred, who had turned it into a paper airplane with one lazy flick of his wand, \"Ron!\" she said furiously. \"Don't you ever let me see you throw-ing knives again!\" \"I wont,\" said Ron, \"let you see,\" he added under his breath, as he turned back to the sprout mountain. \"Fred, George, I'm sorry, dears, but Remus is arriving tonight, so Bill will have to squeeze in with you two.\" ; \"No problem,\" said George. - \"Then, as Charlie isn't coming home, that just leaves Harry and ;¦/ Ron in the attic, and if Fleur shares with Ginny --\" \"-- that'll make Ginny's Christmas --\" muttered Fred. \"-- everyone should be comfortable. Well, they'll have a bed, anyway,\" said Mrs. Weasley, sounding slightly harassed. \"Percy definitely not showing his ugly face, then?\" asked Fred. Mrs. Weasley turned away before she answered. \"No, he's busy, I expect, at the Ministry.\" \"Or he's the world's biggest prat,\" said Fred, as Mrs. Weasley left the kitchen. \"One of the two. \"Well, let's get going, then, George.\" \"What are you two up to?\" asked Ron. \"Cant you help us with these sprouts? You could just use your wand and then we'll be free too!\" \"No, I don't think we can do that,\" said Fred seriously. \"It's very character-building stuff, learning to peel sprouts without magic, makes you appreciate how difficult it is for Muggles and Squibs --\" \"-- and if you want people to help you, Ron,\" added George, throwing the paper airplane at him, \"I wouldn't chuck knives at them. Just a little hint. We're off to the village, there's a very pretty girl working in the paper shop who thinks my card tricks are some-thing marvelous . . , almost like real magic. ...\" \"Gits,\" said Ron darkly, watching Fred and George setting off across the snowy yard. \"Would've only taken them ten seconds and then we could've gone too.\" \"I couldn't,\" said Harry. \"I promised Dumbledore I wouldn't wander off while I'm staying here.\" \"Oh yeah,\" said Ron. He peeled a few more sprouts and then said, \"Are you going to tell Dumbledore what you heard Snape and Malfoy saying to each other?\" \"Yep,\" said Harry. \"I'm going to tell anyone who can put a stop to it, and Dumbledore’s top of the list. I might have another word with your dad too.\" \"Pity you didn't hear what Malfoy’s actually doing, though.\" \"I couldn't have done, could I? That was the whole point, he was refusing to tell Snape.\" There was silence for a moment or two, then Ron said, \" 'Course, you know what they'll all say? Dad and Dumbledore and all of them? They'll say Snape isn't really trying to help Malfoy, he was just trying to find out what Malfoy's up to.\" \"They didn't hear him,\" said Harry flatly. \"No one's that good an actor, not even Snape.\" \"Yeah . . . I'm just saying, though/' said Ron. Harry turned to face him, frowning. \"You think I'm right, though?\" , \"Yeah, I do!\" said Ron hastily. \"Seriously, I do! But they're all convinced Snape's in the Order, aren't they?\" Harry said nothing. It had already occurred to him that this would be the most likely objection to his new evidence; he could hear Hermione now: Obviously, Harry, he was pretending to offer help so he could trick Malfoy into telling him what he's doing. . . . This was pure imagination, however, as he had had no opportu-nity to tell Hermione what he had overheard. She had disappeared from Slughorn's party before he returned to it, or so he had been informed by an irate McLaggen, and she had already gone to bed by the time he returned to the common room. As he and Ron had left for the Burrow early the next day, he had barely had time to wish her a happy Christmas and to tell her that he had some very important news when they got back from the holidays. He was not entirely sure that she had heard him, though; Ron and Lavender had been saying a thoroughly nonverbal good-bye just behind him at the time. Still, even Hermione would not be able to deny one thing: Mal-foy was definitely up to something, and Snape knew it, so Harry felt fully justified in saying \"I told you so,\" which he had done sev-eral times to Ron already. Harry did not get the chance to speak to Mr. Weasley, who was working very long hours at the Ministry, until Christmas Eve night. The Weasleys and their guests were sitting in the living room, which Ginny had decorated so lavishly that it was rather like sitting in a paper-chain explosion. Fred, George, Harry, and Ron were the only ones who knew that the angel on top of the tree was actually a garden gnome that had bitten Fred on the ankle as hr pulled up carrots for Christmas dinner. Stupefied, painted gold, stuffed into a miniature tutu and with small wings glued to il.s back, it glowered down at them all, the ugliest angel Harry had ever seen, with a large bald head like a potato and rather hairy feet. They were all supposed to be listening to a Christmas broadcast by Mrs. Weasleys favorite singer, Celestina Warbeck, whose voice was warbling out of the large wooden wireless set. Fleur, who seemed to find Celestina very dull, was talking so loudly in the corner that a scowling Mrs. Weasley kept pointing her wand at the volume con-trol, so that Celestina grew louder and louder. Under cover of a par-ticularly jazzy number called \"A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love,\" Fred and George started a game of Exploding Snap with Ginny. Ron kept shooting Bill and Fleur covert looks, as though hoping to pick up tips. Meanwhile, Remus Lupin, who was thinner and more ragged-looking than ever, was sitting beside the fire, staring into its depths as though he could not hear Celestinas voice. Oh, come and stir my cauldron, And if you do it right, I'll boil you up some hot strong love To keep you warm tonight. \"We danced to this when we were eighteen!\" said Mrs. Weasley, wiping her eyes on her knitting. \"Do you remember, Arthur?\" \"Mphf?\" said Mr. Weasley, whose head had been nodding over the satsuma he was peeling. \"Oh yes ... marvelous tune . . .\" With an effort, he sat up a little straighter and looked around at Harry, who was sitting next to him. \"Sorry about this,\" he said, jerking his head toward the wireless as Celestina broke into the chorus. \"Be over soon.\" \"No problem,\" said Harry, grinning. \"Has it been busy at the Ministry?\" \"Very,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"I wouldn't mind if we were getting anywhere, but of the three arrests we've made in the last couple of months, I doubt that one of them is a genuine Death Eater -- only don't repeat that, Harry,\" he added quickly, looking much more awake all of a sudden. \"They're not still holding Stan Shunpike, are they?\" asked Harry. \"I'm afraid so,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"I know Dumbledore's tried appealing directly to Scrimgeour about Stan. ... I mean, anybody who has actually interviewed him agrees that he's about as much a Death Eater as this satsuma . . . but the top levels want to look as though they're making some progress, and 'three arrests' sounds better than 'three mistaken arrests and releases'. . . but again, this is all top secret. . . .\" \"I won't say anything,\" said Harry. He hesitated for a moment, wondering how best to embark on what he wanted to say; as he marshaled his thoughts, Celestina Warbeck began a ballad called \"You Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me.\" \"Mr. Weasley, you know what I told you at the station when we were setting off for school?\" \"I checked, Harry,\" said Mr. Weasley at once. \"I went and searched the Malfoys' house. There was nothing, either broken or whole, that shouldn't have been there.\" \"Yeah, I know, I saw in the Prophet that you'd looked . . . but this is something different. . . . Well, something more ...\" And he told Mr. Weasley everything he had overheard between Malfoy and Snape, As Harry spoke, he saw Lupin's head turn a lit-tle toward him, taking in every word. When he had finished, there was silence, except for Celestina's crooning. Oh, my poor heart, where has it gone? It's left me for a spell... \"Has it occurred to you, Harry,\" said Mr. Weasley, \"that Snape was simply pretending -- ?\" \"Pretending to offer help, so that he could find out what Malfoy's up to?\" said Harry quickly. \"Yeah, I thought you'd say that. But how do we know?\" \"It isn't our business to know,\" said Lupin unexpectedly. He had turned his back on the fire now and faced Harry across Mr. Weasley. \"It's Dumbledore’s business. Dumbledore trusts Severus, and that ought to be good enough for all of us.\" \"But,\" said Harry, \"just say -- just say Dumbledores wrong about Snape --\" \"People have said it, many times. It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore’s judgment. I do; therefore, I trust Severus.\" \"But Dumbledore can make mistakes,\" argued Harry. \"He says it himself. And you\" -- he looked Lupin straight in the eye -- \"do you honestly like Snape?\" \"I neither like nor dislike Severus,\" said Lupin. \"No, Harry, I am speaking the truth,\" he added, as Harry pulled a skeptical expres-sion. \"We shall never be bosom friends, perhaps; after all that hap-pened between James and Sirius and Severus, there is too much bitterness there. But I do not forget that during the year I taught at Hogwarts, Severus made the Wolfsbane Potion for me every month, made it perfectly, so that I did not have to suffer as I usu-ally do at the full moon.\" \"But he 'accidentally' let it slip that you're a werewolf, so you had to leave!\" said Harry angrily. Lupin shrugged. \"The news would have leaked out anyway. We both know he wanted my job, but he could have wreaked much worse damage on me by tampering with the potion. He kept me healthy. I must be grateful.\" \"Maybe he didn't dare mess with the potion with Dumbledore watching him!\" said Harry. \"You are determined to hate him, Harry,\" said Lupin with a faint smile. \"And I understand; with James as your father, with Sir-ius as your godfather, you have inherited an old prejudice. By all means tell Dumbledore what you have told Arthur and me, but do not expect him to share your view of the matter; do not even expect him to be surprised by what you tell him. It might have been on Dumbledore's orders that Severus questioned Draco.\" ; . . . and now you've torn it quite apart I'll thank you to give back my heart! Celestina ended her song on a very long, high-pitched note and loud applause issued out of the wireless, which Mrs. Weasley joined in with enthusiastically. \"Eez eet over?\" said Fleur loudly. \"Thank goodness, what an 'orrible --\" \"Shall we have a nightcap, then?\" asked Mr. Weasley loudly, leaping to his feet. \"Who wants eggnog?\" \"What have you been up to lately?\" Harry asked Lupin, as Mr, Weasley bustled off to fetch the eggnog, and everybody else stretched and broke into conversation. \"Oh, I've been underground,\" said Lupin. \"Almost literally. That's why I haven't been able to write, Harry; sending letters to you would have been something of a giveaway.\" -: \"What do you mean?\" ' \"I've been living among my fellows, my equals,\" said Lupin. \"Werewolves,\" he added, at Harrys look of incomprehension. \"Nearly all of them are on Voldemort's side. Dumbledore wanted a spy and here I was . . . ready-made.\" He sounded a little bitter, and perhaps realized it, for he smiled more warmly as he went on, \"I am not complaining; it is necessary work and who can do it better than I? However, it has been difficult gaining their trust. I bear the unmistakable signs of having tried to live among wizards, you see, whereas they have shunned normal society and live on the margins, stealing -- and sometimes killing -- to eat.\" \"How come they like Voldemort?\" \"They think that, under his rule, they will have a better life,\" said Lupin. \"And it is hard to argue with Greyback out there. . . .\" \"Who's Greyback?\" \"You haven't heard of him?\" Lupin's hands closed convulsively in his lap. \"Fenrir Greyback is, perhaps, the most savage werewolf alive today. He regards it as his mission in life to bite and to conta-minate as many people as possible; he wants to create enough were-wolves to overcome the wizards. Voldemort has promised him prey in return for his services. Greyback specializes in children. . . . Bite them young, he says, and raise them away from their parents, raise them to hate normal wizards. Voldemort has threatened to unleash him upon people's sons and daughters; it is a threat that usually produces good results.\" Lupin paused and then said, \"It was Greyback who bit me.\" \"What?\" said Harry, astonished. \"When -- when you were a kid, you mean?\" \"Yes. My father had offended him. I did not know, for a very long time, the identity of the werewolf who had attacked me; I even felt pity for him, thinking that he had had no control, know-ing by then how it felt to transform. But Greyback is not like that. At the full moon, he positions himself close to victims, ensuring that he is near enough to strike. He plans it all. And this is the man Voldemort is using to marshal the werewolves. I cannot pretend that my particular brand of reasoned argument is making much headway against Greyback's insistence that we werewolves deserve blood, that we ought to revenge ourselves on normal people.\" \"But you are normal!\" said Harry fiercely. \"You've just got a -- a problem --\" Lupin burst out laughing. \"Sometimes you remind me a lot of James. He called it my 'furry little problem in company. Many people were under the impression that I owned a badly behaved rabbit.\" He accepted a glass of eggnog from Mr. Weasley with a word of thanks, looking slightly more cheerful, Harry, meanwhile, felt a rush of excitement: This last mention of his father had reminded him that there was something he had been looking forward to ask-ing Lupin. \"Have you ever heard of someone called the Half-Blood Prince?\" \"The Half-Blood what?\" \"Prince,\" said Harry, watching him closely for signs of recogni-tion. \"There are no Wizarding princes,\" said Lupin, now smiling. \"Is this a title you re thinking of adopting? I should have thought be-ing 'the Chosen One' would be enough.\" \"It's nothing to do with me!\" said Harry indignantly. \"The Half-Blood Prince is someone who used to go to Hogwarts, I've got his old Potions book. He wrote spells all over it, spells he invented. One of them was Levicorpus --\" \"Oh, that one had a great vogue during my time at Hogwarts,\" said Lupin reminiscently. \"There were a few months in my fifth year when you couldn't move for being hoisted into the air by your ankle.\" \"My dad used it,\" said Harry. \"I saw him in the Pensieve, he used it on Snape.\" He tried to sound casual, as though this was a throwaway com-ment of no real importance, but he was not sure he had achieved the right effect; Lupins smile was a little too understanding. \"Yes,\" he said, \"but he wasn't the only one. As I say, it was very popular. . . . You know how these spells come and go. , . .\" \"But it sounds like it was invented while you were at school,\" Harry persisted. \"Not necessarily,\" said Lupin. \"Jinxes go in and out of fashion like everything else.\" He looked into Harry's face and then said quietly, \"James was a pureblood, Harry, and I promise you, he never asked us to call him 'Prince.'\" Abandoning pretense, Harry said, \"And it wasn't Sirius? Or you?\" \"Definitely not.\" \"Oh.\" Harry stared into the fire. \"I just thought -- well, he's helped me out a lot in Potions classes, the Prince has.\" \"How old is this book, Harry?\" \"I dunno, I've never checked.\" \"Well, perhaps that will give you some clue as to when the Prince was at Hogwarts,\" said Lupin. Shortly after this, Fleur decided to imitate Celestina singing \"A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love,\" which was taken by everyone, once they had glimpsed Mrs. Weasley's expression, to be the cue to go to bed. Harry and Ron climbed all the way up to Ron's attic bedroom, where a camp bed had been added for Harry. Ron fell asleep almost immediately, but Harry delved into his trunk and pulled out his copy of Advanced Potion-Making before getting into bed. There he turned its pages, searching, until he finally found, at the front of the book, the date that it had been pub-lished. It was nearly fifty years old. Neither his father, nor his father's friends, had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago. Feeling disappointed, Harry threw the book back into his trunk, turned off the lamp, and rolled over, thinking of werewolves and Snape, Stan Shunpike and the Half-Blood Prince, and finally falling into an uneasy sleep full of creeping shadows and the cries of bitten children. . . . \"She's got to be joking. . . .\" Harry woke with a start to find a bulging stocking lying over the end of his bed. He put on his glasses and looked around; the tiny window was almost completely obscured with snow and, in front of it, Ron was sitting bolt upright in bed and examining what ap-peared to be a thick gold chain. \"What's chat?\" asked Harry. ' \"Its from Lavender,\" said Ron, sounding revolted^ \"She earn honestly think I'd wear ...\" Harry looked more closely and let out a shout of laughter, Dan gling from the chain in large gold letters were the words: \"My sweetheart\" \"Nice,\" he said. \"Classy. You should definitely wear it in front ol Fred and George.\" \"If you tell them,\" said Ron, shoving the necklace out of sight under his pillow, \"I -- I -- I’ll --\" \"Stutter at me?\" said Harry, grinning. \"Come on, would I?\" \"How could she think I'd like something like that, though?\" Ron demanded of thin air, looking rather shocked. \"Well, think back,\" said Harry. \"Have you ever let it slip that you'd like to go out in public with the words 'My Sweetheart' round your neck?\" \"Well... we don't really talk much,\" said Ron. \"It's mainly . . .\" \"Snogging,\" said Harry. \"Well, yeah,\" said Ron. He hesitated a moment, then said, \"Is Hermione really going out with McLaggen?\" \"I dunno,\" said Harry. \"They were at Slughorn's party together, but I don't think it went that well.\" Ron looked slightly more cheerful as he delved deeper into his stocking. Harrys presents included a sweater with a large Golden Snitch worked onto the front, hand-knitted by Mrs. Weasley, a large box of Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes products from the twins, and a slightly damp, moldy-smelling package that came with a label read-ing To Master, From Kreacher, Harry stared at it. \"D'you reckon this is safe to open?\" he asked. \"Can't be anything dangerous, all our mail's still being searched at the Ministry,\" replied Ron, though he was eyeing the parcel suspiciously. \"I didn't think of giving Kreacher anything. Do people usually give their house-elves Christmas presents?\" asked Harry, prodding the parcel cautiously. \"Hermione would,\" said Ron. \"But let's wait and see what it is before you start feeling guilty.\" A moment later, Harry had given a loud yell and leapt out of his camp bed; the package contained a large number of maggots. \"Nice,\" said Ron, roaring with laughter. \"Very thoughtful.\" \"I'd rather have them than that necklace,\" said Harry, which sobered Ron up at once. Everybody was wearing new sweaters when they all sat down for Christmas lunch, everyone except Fleur (on whom, it appeared, Mrs. Weasley had not wanted to waste one) and Mrs. Weasley herself, who was sporting a brand-new midnight blue witch's hat glittering with what looked like tiny starlike diamonds, and a spec-tacular golden necklace. \"Fred and George gave them to me! Aren't they beautiful?\" .: \"Well, we find we appreciate you more and more, Mum, now we're washing our own socks,\" said George, waving an airy hand. \"Parsnips, Remus?\" \"Harry, you've got a maggot in your hair,\" said Ginny cheerfully, leaning across the table to pick it out; Harry felt goose bumps erupt up his neck that had nothing to do with the maggot. \"'Ow 'orrible,\" said Fleur, with an affected little shudder. \"Yes, isn't it?\" said Ron. \"Gravy, Fleur?\" . In his eagerness to help her, he knocked the gravy boat flying; Bill waved his wand and the gravy soared up in the air and returned meekly to the boat. \"You are as bad as zat Tonks,\" said Fleur to Ron, when she had finished kissing Bill in thanks. \"She is always knocking --\" \"I invited dear Tonks to come along today,\" said Mrs. Weasley, setting down the carrots with unnecessary force and glaring at Fleur. \"But she wouldn't come. Have you spoken to her lately, Remus?\" \"No, I haven't been in contact with anybody very much,\" said Lupin. \"But Tonks has got her own family to go to, hasn't she?\" \"Hmmm,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"Maybe. I got the impression she was planning to spend Christmas alone, actually.\" She gave Lupin an annoyed look, as though it was all his fault she was getting Fleur for a daughter-in-law instead of Tonks, but Harry, glancing across at Fleur, who was now feeding Bill bits of turkey off her own fork, thought that Mrs. Weasley was fighting a long-lost battle. He was, however, reminded of a question he had with regard to Tonks, and who better to ask than Lupin, the man who knew all about Patronuses? \"Tonks's Patronus has changed its form,\" he told him. \"Snape said so anyway. I didn't know that could happen. Why would your Patronus change?\" Lupin took his time chewing his turkey and swallowing before saying slowly, \"Sometimes ... a great shock ... an emotional up-heaval ...\" \"It looked big, and it had four legs,\" said Harry, struck by a sud-den thought and lowering his voice. \"Hey ... it couldn't be -- ?\" \"Arthur!\" said Mrs. Weasley suddenly. She had risen from her chair; her hand was pressed over her heart and she was staring out of the kitchen window. \"Arthur -- it's Percy!\" \"What?\" Mr. Weasley looked around. Everybody looked quickly at the window; Ginny stood up for a better look. There, sure enough, was Percy Weasley, striding across the snowy yard, his horn-rimmed glasses glinting in the sunlight. He was not, however, alone. \"Arthur, he's -- he's with the Minister!\" And sure enough, the man Harry had seen in the Daily Prophet was following along in Percy's wake, limping slightly, his mane of graying hair and his black cloak flecked with snow. Before any of , them could say anything, before Mr. and Mrs. Weasley could do : more than exchange stunned looks, the back door opened and there stood Percy. There was a moment's painful silence. Then Percy said rather stiffly, \"Merry Christmas, Mother.\" \"Oh, Percy!\" said Mrs. Weasley, and she threw herself into his arms. Rufus Scrimgeour paused in the doorway, leaning on his walk-ing stick and smiling as he observed this affecting scene. \"You must forgive this intrusion,\" he said, when Mrs. Weasley looked around at him, beaming and wiping her eyes. \"Percy and I were in the vicinity -- working, you know -- and he couldn't re-sist dropping in and seeing you all.\" But Percy showed no sign of wanting to greet any of the rest of the family. He stood, poker-straight and awkward-looking, and stared over everybody else's heads. Mr. Weasley, Fred, and George were all observing him, stony-faced. \"Please, come in, sit down, Minister!\" fluttered Mrs. Weasley, straightening her hat. Have a little purkey, or some tooding. ... 1 '. mean --\" \"No, no, my dear Molly,\" said Scrimgeour. Harry guessed that he had checked her name with Percy before they entered the house. \"I don't want to intrude, wouldn't be here at all if Percy hadn't wanted to see you all so badly. . . .\" \"Oh, Perce!\" said Mrs. Weasley tearfully, reaching up to kiss him. \". , . We've only looked in for five minutes, so I'll have a stroll around the yard while you catch up with Percy. No, no, I assure you I don't want to butt in! Well, if anybody cared to show me your charming garden . . . Ah, that young man's finished, why doesn't he take a stroll with me?\" The atmosphere around the table changed perceptibly. Every-body looked from Scrimgeour to Harry. Nobody seemed to find Scrimgeour's pretense that he did not know Harry's name convincing, or find it natural that he should be chosen to accompany the Minister around the garden when Ginny, Fleur, and George also had clean plates. \"Yeah, all right,\" said Harry into the silence. He was not fooled; for all Scrimgeour's talk that they had just been in the area, that Percy wanted to look up his family, this must be the real reason that they had come, so that Scrimgeour could speak to Harry alone. \"It's fine,\" he said quietly, as he passed Lupin, who had half risen from his chair. \"Fine,\" he added, as Mr. Weasley opened his mouth to speak. \"Wonderful!\" said Scrimgeour, standing back to let Harry pass through the door ahead of him. \"We'll just take a turn around the garden, and Percy and I'll be off. Carry on, everyone!\" Harry walked across the yard toward the Weasleys' overgrown, snow-covered garden, Scrimgeour limping slightly at his side. He had, Harry knew, been Head of the Auror office; he looked tough and battle-scarred, very different from portly Fudge in his bowler hat. \"Charming,\" said Scrimgeour, stopping at the garden fence and looking out over the snowy lawn and the indistinguishable plants. \"Charming.\" Harry said nothing. He could tell that Scrimgeour was watching him. \"I've wanted to meet you for a very long time,\" said Scrimgeour, after a few moments. \"Did you know that?\" \"No,\" said Harry truthfully. ¦!. \"Oh yes, for a very long time. But Dumbledore has been very protective of you,\" said Scrimgeour. \"Natural, of course, natural, after what you've been through. . . . Especially what happened at : the Ministry ...\": He waited for Harry to say something, but Harry did not oblige, : so he went on, \"I have been hoping for an occasion to talk to you ever since I gained office, but Dumbledore has -- most under-standably, as I say -- prevented this.\" Still, Harry said nothing, waiting. \"The rumors that have flown around!\" said Scrimgeour. \"Well, of course, we both know how these stories get distorted ... all these whispers of a prophecy . . . of you being 'the Chosen One'. . .\" They were getting near it now, Harry thought, the reason Scrim-geour was here. \"I assume that Dumbledore has discussed these matters with you?\", Harry deliberated, wondering whether he ought to lie or not. He looked at the little gnome prints all around the flowerbeds, ami the scuffed-up patch that marked the spot where Fred had caught the gnome now wearing the tutu at the top of the Christmas tree. Finally, he decided on the truth ... or a bit of it. \"Yeah, we've discussed it.\" \"Have you, have you . . .\" said Scrimgeour. Harry could see, out of the corner of his eye, Scrimgeour squinting at him, so he pre-tended to be very interested in a gnome that had just poked its head out from underneath a frozen rhododendron. \"And what has Dumbledore told you, Harry?\" \"Sorry, but that's between us,\" said Harry. He kept his voice as pleasant as he could, and Scrimgeour's tone, too, was light and friendly as he said, \"Oh, of course, if it's a question of confidences, I wouldn't want you to divulge . . . no, no ... and in any case, does it really matter whether you are 'the Chosen One' or not?\" Harry had to mull that one over for a few seconds before re-sponding. \"I don't really know what you mean, Minister.\" \"Well, of course, to you it will matter enormously,\" said Scrim-geour with a laugh. \"But to the Wizarding community at large . . . it's all perception, isn't it? It's what people believe that's important.\" Harry said nothing. He thought he saw, dimly, where they were heading, but he was not going to help Scrimgeour get there. The gnome under the rhododendron was now digging for worms at its roots, and Harry kept his eyes fixed upon it. \"People believe you are 'the Chosen One,' you see,\" said Scrim-geour. \"They think you quite the hero -- which, of course, you arc, Harry, chosen or not! How many times have you faced He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named now? Well, anyway,\" he pressed on, without waiting for a reply, \"the point is, you are a symbol of hope lor many, Harry. The idea that there is somebody out there who might be able, who might even be destined, to destroy He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named -- well, naturally, it gives people a lift. And I can't help but feel that, once you realize this, you might consider it, well, almost a duty, to stand alongside the Ministry, and give everyone a boost.\" The gnome had just managed to get hold of a worm. It was now tugging very hard on it, trying to get it out of the frozen ground. Harry was silent so long that Scrimgeour said, looking from Harry to the gnome, \"Funny little chaps, aren't they? But what say you, Harry?\" \"I don't exactly understand what you want,\" said Harry slowly. '\"Stand alongside the Ministry' . . . What does that mean?\" \"Oh, well, nothing at all onerous, I assure you,\" said Scrim-geour. \"If you were to be seen popping in and out of the Ministry from time to time, for instance, that would give the right impres-sion. And of course, while you were there, you would have ample : opportunity to speak to Gawain Robards, my successor as Head of the Auror office. Dolores Umbridge has told me that you cherish an ambition to become an Auror. Well, that could be arranged very easily. ...\" Harry felt anger bubbling in the pit of his stomach: So Dolores Umbridge was still at the Ministry, was she? \"So basically,\" he said, as though he just wanted to clarify a few points, \"you'd like to give the impression that I'm working for the Ministry?\" \"It would give everyone a lift to think you were more involved, Harry,\" said Scrimgeour, sounding relieved that Harry had cot-toned on so quickly. \"'The Chosen One,' you know. . . It's all about giving people hope, the feeling that exciting things are hap-pening. ...\" \"But if I keep running in and out of the Ministry,\" said Harry, still endeavoring to keep his voice friendly, \"won't that seem as though I approve of what the Ministry's up to?\" \"Well,\" said Scrimgeour, frowning slightly, \"well, yes, that's partly why we'd like --\" \"No, I don't think that'll work,\" said Harry pleasantly. \"You see, I don't like some of the things the Ministry's doing. Locking up Stan Shunpike, for instance.\" Scrimgeour did not speak for a moment but his expression hard-ened instantly. \"I would not expect you to understand,\" he said, and he was not as successful at keeping anger out of his voice as Harry had been. \"These are dangerous times, and certain measures need to be taken. You are sixteen years old --\" \"Dumbledore's a lot older than sixteen, and he doesn't think Stan should be in Azkaban either,\" said Harry. \"You're making Stan a scapegoat, just like you want to make me a mascot.\" They looked at each other, long and hard. Finally Scrimgeour said, with no pretense at warmth, \"I see. You prefer -- like your hero, Dumbledore -- to disassociate yourself from the Ministry?\" \"I don't want to be used,\" said Harry. \"Some would say it's your duty to be used by the Ministry!\" \"Yeah, and others might say its your duty to check that people really are Death Eaters before you chuck them in prison,\" said Harry, his temper rising now. \"You're doing what Barty Crouch did. You never get it right, you people, do you? Either we've got Fudge, pretending everything's lovely while people get murdered right under his nose, or we've got you, chucking the wrong people into jail and trying to pretend you've got 'the Chosen One' work-ing for you!\" ' i \"So you're not 'the Chosen One'?\" said Scrimgeour. ' \"I thought you said it didn't matter either way?\" said Harry, with a bitter laugh. \"Not to you anyway.\" \"I shouldn't have said that,\" said Scrimgeour quickly. \"It was tactless --\" \"No, it was honest,\" said Harry. \"One of the only honest things you've said to me. You don't care whether I live or die, but you do care that I help you convince everyone you're winning the war against Voldemort. I haven't forgotten, Minister....\" He raised his right fist. There, shining white on the back of his cold hand, were the scars which Dolores Umbridge had forced him to carve into his own flesh: I must not tell lies. \"I don't remember you rushing to my defense when I was trying to tell everyone Voldemort was back. The Ministry wasn't so keen to be pals last year.\" They stood in silence as icy as the ground beneath their feet. The gnome had finally managed to extricate his worm and was now sucking on it happily, leaning against the bottommost branches of the rhododendron bush. \"What is Dumbledore up to?\" said Scrimgeour brusquely. \"Where does he go when he is absent from Hogwarts?\" \"No idea,\" said Harry. \"And you wouldn't tell me if you knew,\" said Scrimgeour, \"would you?\" \"No, 1 wouldn't,\" said Harry. \"Well, then, I shall have to see whether I can't find out by other means.\" \"You can try,\" said Harry indifferently. \"But you seem cleverer than Fudge, so I'd have thought you'd have learned from his mis-takes. He tried interfering at Hogwarts. You might have noticed he's not Minister anymore, but Dumbledore’s still headmaster. I'd leave Dumbledore alone, if I were you.\" There was a long pause. \"Well, it is clear to me that he has done a very good job on you,\" said Scrimgeour, his eyes cold and hard behind his wire-rimmed glasses, \"Dumbledore’s man through and through, aren't you, Potter?\" \"Yeah, I am,\" said Harry. \"Glad we straightened that out.\" And turning his back on the Minister of Magic, he strode back toward the house. \n",

            " THIRTY-SEVEN The Lost Prophecy Harry’s feet hit solid ground; his knees buckled a little and the golden wizard’s head fell with a resounding dunk to the floor. He looked around and saw that he had arrived in Dumbledore’s office. Everything seemed to have repaired itself during the Headmaster’s absence. The delicate silver instruments stood once more on the spindle-legged tables, puffing and whirring serenely the portraits of the headmasters and headmistresses were snoozing in their frames, heads lolling back in armchairs or against the edge of the picture. Harry looked through the window. There was a cool line of pale green along the horizon: dawn was approaching. The silence and the stillness, broken only by the occasional grunt or snuffle of a sleeping portrait, was unbearable to him. If his surroundings could have reflected the feelings inside him, the pictures would have been screaming in pain. He walked around the quiet, beautiful office, breathing quickly, trying not to think. But he had to think... there was no escape... It was his fault Sirius had died; it was all his fault. If he, Harry, had not been stupid enough to fall for Voldemort’s trick, if he had not been so convinced that what he had seen in his dream was real, if he had only opened his mind to the possibility that Voldemort was, as Hermione had said, banking on Harry’s love of playing the hero... It was unbearable, he would not think about it, he could not stand it... there was a terrible hollow inside him he did not want to feel or examine, a dark hole where Sirius had been, where Sirius had vanished; he did not want to have to be alone with that great, silent space, he could not stand it - A picture behind him gave a particularly loud grunting snore, and a cool voice said, \"Ah... Harry Potter...\" Phineas Nigellus gave a long yawn, stretching his arms as he surveyed Harry out of shrewd, narrow eyes. \"And what brings you here in the early hours of the morning?\" said Phineas eventually \"This office is supposed to be barred to all but the rightful Headmaster. Or has Dumbledore sent you here? Oh, don’t tell me...\" He gave another shuddering yawn. \"Another message for my worthless great-great-grandson?\" Harry could not speak. Phineas Nigellus did not know that Sirius was dead, but Harry could not tell him. To say it aloud would be to make it final, absolute, irretrievable. A few more of the portraits had stirred now. Terror of being interrogated made Harry stride across the room and seize the doorknob. It would not turn. He was shut in. \"I hope this means,\" said the corpulent, red-nosed wizard who hung on the wall behind the Headmaster’s desk, \"that Dumbledore will soon be back among us?\" Harry turned. The wizard was surveying him with great interest. Harry nodded. He tugged again on the doorknob behind his back, but it remained immovable. \"Oh good,\" said the wizard. \"It has been very dull without him, very dull indeed.\" He settled himself on the throne-like chair on which he had been painted and smiled benignly upon Harry \"Dumbledore thinks very highly of you, as I am sure you know,\" he said comfortably. \"Oh yes. Holds you in great esteem.\" The guilt filling the whole of Harry’s chest like some monstrous, weighty parasite, now writhed and squirmed. Harry could not stand this, he could not stand being himself any more... he had never felt more trapped inside his own head and body, never wished so intensely that he could be somebody; anybody, else... The empty fireplace burst into emerald green flame, making Harry leap away from the door, staring at the man spinning inside the grate. As Dumbledore’s tall form unfolded itself from the fire, the wizards and witches on the surrounding walls jerked awake, many of them giving cries of welcome. \"Thank you,\" said Dumbledore softly. He did not look at Harry at first, but walked over to the perch beside the door and withdrew, from an inside pocket of his robes, the tiny, ugly, featherless Fawkes, whom he placed gently on the tray of soft ashes beneath the golden post where the full-grown Fawkes usually stood. \"Well, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, finally turning away from the baby bird, \"you will be pleased to hear that none of your fellow students are going to suffer lasting damage from the night’s events.\" Harry tried to say, \"Good,\" but no sound came out. It seemed to him that Dumbledore was reminding him of the amount of damage he had caused, and although Dumbledore was for once looking at him directly, and although his expression was kindly rather than accusatory, Harry could not bear to meet his eyes. \"Madam Pomfrey is patching everybody up,\" said Dumbledore. \"Nymphadora Tonks may need to spend a little time in St. Mungo’s, but it seems she will make a full recovery.\" Harry contented himself with nodding at the carpet, which was growing lighter as the sky outside grew paler. He was sure all the portraits around the room were listening closely to every word Dumbledore spoke, wondering where Dumbledore and Harry had been, and why there had been injuries. \"I know how you’re feeling, Harry,\" said Dumbledore very quietly. \"No, you don’t,\" said Harry, and his voice was suddenly loud and strong; white-hot anger leapt inside him; Dumbledore knew nothing about his feelings. \"You see, Dumbledore?\" said Phineas Nigellus slyly \"Never try to understand the students. They hate it. They would much rather be tragically misunderstood, wallow in self-pity, stew in their own -\" \"That’s enough, Phineas,\" said Dumbledore. Harry turned his back on Dumbledore and stared determinedly out of the window. He could see the Quidditch stadium in the distance. Sirius had appeared there once, disguised as the shaggy black dog, so he could watch Harry play... he had probably come to see whether Harry was as good as James had been... Harry had never asked him... \"There is no shame in what you are feeling, Harry,\" said Dumbledore’s voice. \"On the contrary... the fact that you can feel pain like this is your greatest strength.\" Harry felt the white-hot anger lick his insides, blazing in the terrible emptiness, filling him with the desire to hurt Dumbledore for his calmness and his empty words. \"My greatest strength, is it?\" said Harry, his voice shaking as he stared out at the Quidditch stadium, no longer seeing it. \"You haven’t got a clue... you don’t know...\" \"What don’t I know?\" asked Dumbledore calmly. It was too much. Harry turned around, shaking with rage. \"I don’t want to talk about how I feel, all right?\" \"Harry, suffering like this proves you are still a man! This pain is part of being human\" \"THEN - I - DON’T - WANT - TO - BE - HUMAN!\" Harry roared, and he seized the delicate silver instrument from the spindlelegged table beside him and flung it across the room; it shattered into a hundred tiny pieces against the wall. Several of the pictures let out yells of anger and fright, and the portrait of Armando Dippet said, \"Really!\" \"I DON’T CARE!\" Harry yelled at them, snatching up a lunascope and throwing it into the fireplace. \"I’VE HAD ENOUGH, I’VE SEEN ENOUGH, I WANT OUT, I WANT IT TO END, I DON’T CARE ANY MORE\" He seized the table on which the silver instrument had stood and threw that, too. It broke apart on the floor and the legs rolled in different directions. \"You do care,\" said Dumbledore. He had not flinched or made a single move to stop Harry demolishing his office. His expression was calm, almost detached. \"You care so much you feel as though you will bleed to death with the pain of it.\" \"I - DON’T!\" Harry screamed, so loudly that he felt his throat might tear, and for a second he wanted to rush at Dumbledore and break him, too; shatter that calm old face, shake him, hurt him, make him feel some tiny part of the horror inside himself. \"Oh, yes, you do,\" said Dumbledore, still more calmly. \"You have now lost your mother, your father, and the closest thing to a parent you have ever known. Of course you care.\" \"YOU DON’T KNOW HOW I FEEL!\" Harry roared. \"YOU - STANDING THERE - YOU\" But words were no longer enough, smashing things was no more help; he wanted to run, he wanted to keep running and never look back, he wanted to be somewhere he could not see the clear blue eyes staring at him, that hatefully calm old face. He turned on his heel and ran to the door, seized the doorknob again and wrenched at it. But the door would not open. Harry turned back to Dumbledore. \"Let me out,\" he said. He was shaking from head to foot. \"No,\" said Dumbledore, simply. For a few seconds they stared at each other. \"Let me out,\" Harry said again. \"No,\" Dumbledore repeated. \"If you don’t - if you keep me in here - if you don ‘t let me\" \"By all means continue destroying my possessions,\" said Dumbledore serenely. \"I daresay I have too many.\" He walked around his desk and sat down. behind it, watching Harry. \"Let me out,\" Harry said yet again, in a voice that was cold and almost as calm as Dumbledore’s. \"Not until I have had my say,\" said Dumbledore. \"Do you - do you think I want to - do you think I give a - I DON’T CARE WHAT YOU’VE GOT TO SAY!\" Harry roared. \"I don’t want to hear anything you’ve got to say!\" \"You will,\" said Dumbledore steadily. \"Because you are not nearly as angry with me as you ought to be. If you are to attack me, as I know you are close to doing, I would like to have thoroughly earned it.\" \"What are you talking -?\" \"It is my fault that Sirius died,\" said Dumbledore clearly. \"Or should I say, almost entirely my fault - I will not be so arrogant as to claim responsibility for the whole. Sirius was a brave, clever and energetic man, and such men are not usually content to sit at home in hiding while they believe others to be in danger. Nevertheless, you should never have believed for an instant that there was any necessity for you to go to the Department of Mysteries tonight. If I had been open with you, Harry, as I should have been, you would have known a long time ago that Voldemort might try and lure you to the Department of Mysteries, and you would never have been tricked into going there tonight. And Sirius would not have had to come after you. That blame lies with me, and with me alone.\" Harry was still standing with his hand on the doorknob but was unaware of it. He was gazing at Dumbledore, hardly breathing, listening yet barely understanding what he was hearing. \"Please sit down,\" said Dumbledore. It was not an order, it was a request. Harry hesitated, then walked slowly across the room now littered with silver cogs and fragments of wood, and took the seat facing Dumbledore’s desk. \"Am I to understand,\" said Phineas Nigellus slowly from Harry’s left, \"that my great-great-grandson - the last of the Blacks - is dead?\" \"Yes, Phineas,\" said Dumbledore. \"I don’t believe it,\" said Phineas brusquely. Harry turned his head in time to see Phineas marching out of his portrait and knew that he had gone to visit his other painting in Grimmauld Place. He would walk, perhaps, from portrait to portrait, calling for Sirius through the house... \"Harry, I owe you an explanation,\" said Dumbledore. \"An explanation of an old man’s mistakes. For I see now that what I have done, and not done, with regard to you, bears all the hallmarks of the failings of age. Youth cannot know how age thinks and feels. But old men are guilty if they forget what it was to be young... and I seem to have forgotten, lately...\" The sun was rising properly now; there was a rim of dazzling orange visible over the mountains and the sky above it was colorless and bright. The light fell upon Dumbledore, upon the silver of his eyebrows and beard, upon the lines gouged deeply into his face. \"I guessed, fifteen years ago,\" said Dumbledore, \"when I saw the scar on your forehead, what it might mean. I guessed that it might be the sign of a connection forged between you and Voldemort.\" \"You’ve told me this before, Professor,\" said Harry bluntly. He did not care about being rude. He did not care about anything very much any more. \"Yes,\" said Dumbledore apologetically. \"Yes, but you see - it is necessary to start with your scar. For it became apparent, shortly after you rejoined the magical world, that I was correct, and that your scar was giving you warnings when Voldemort was close to you, or else feeling powerful emotion.\" \"I know,\" said Harry wearily. \"And this ability of yours - to detect Voldemort’s presence, even when he is disguised, and to know what he is feeling when his emotions are roused - has become more and more pronounced since Voldemort returned to his own body and his full powers.\" Harry did not bother to nod. He knew all of this already. \"More recently\" said Dumbledore, \"I became concerned that Voldemort might realize that this connection between you exists. Sure enough, there came a time when you entered so far into his mind and thoughts that he sensed your presence. I am speaking, of course, of the night when you witnessed the attack on Mr. Weasley\" \"Yeah, Snape told me,\" Harry muttered. \"Professor Snape, Harry\" Dumbledore corrected him quietly. \"But did you not wonder why it was not I who explained this to you? Why I did not teach you Occlumency? Why I had not so much as looked at you for months?\" Harry looked up. He could see now that Dumbledore looked sad and tired. \"Yeah,\" Harry mumbled. \"Yeah, I wondered.\" \"You see,\" Dumbledore continued, \"I believed it could not be long before Voldemort attempted to force his way into your mind, to manipulate and misdirect your thoughts, and I was not eager to give him more incentives to do so. I was sure that if he realized that our relationship was - or had ever been - closer than that of headmaster and pupil, he would seize his chance to use you as a means to spy on me. I feared the uses to which he would put you, the possibility that he might try and possess you. Harry, I believe I was right to think that Voldemort would have made use of you in such a way. On those rare occasions when we had close contact, I thought I saw a shadow of him stir behind your eyes...\" Harry remembered the feeling that a dormant snake had risen in him, ready to strike, in those moments when he and Dumbledore had made eye-contact. \"Voldemort’s aim in possessing you, as he demonstrated tonight, would not have been my destruction. It would have been yours. He hoped, when he possessed you briefly a short while ago, that I would sacrifice you in the hope of killing him. So you see, I have been trying, in distancing myself from you, to protect you, Harry. An old man’s mistake...\" He sighed deeply. Harry was letting the words wash over him. He would have been so interested to know all this a few months ago, but now it was meaningless compared to the gaping chasm inside him that was the loss of Sirius; none of it mattered... \"Sirius told me you felt Voldemort awake inside you the very night that you had the vision of Arthur Weasley’s attack. I knew at once that my worst fears were correct: Voldemort had realized he could use you. In an attempt to arm you against Voldemort’s assaults on your mind, I arranged Occlumency lessons with Professor Snape.\" He paused. Harry watched the sunlight, which was sliding slowly across the polished surface of Dumbledore’s desk, illuminate a silver ink pot and a handsome scarlet quill. Harry could tell that the portraits all around them were awake and listening raptly to Dumbledore’s explanation; he could hear the occasional rustle of robes, the slight clearing of a throat. Phineas Nigellus had still not returned... \"Professor Snape discovered,\" Dumbledore resumed, \" that you had been dreaming about the door to the Department of Mysteries for months. Voldemort, of course, had been obsessed with the possibility of hearing the prophecy ever since he regained his body; and as he dwelled on the door, so did you, though you did not know what it meant. \"And then you saw Rockwood, who worked in the Department of Mysteries before his arrest, telling Voldemort what we had known all along - that the prophecies held in the Ministry of Magic are heavily protected. Only the people to whom they refer can lift them from the shelves without suffering madness: in this case, either Voldemort himself would have to enter the Ministry of Magic, and risk revealing himself at last - or else you would have to take it for him. It became a matter of even greater urgency that you should master Occlumency\" \"But I didn’t,\" muttered Harry. He said it aloud to try and ease the dead weight of guilt inside him: a confession must surely relieve some of the terrible pressure squeezing his heart. \"I didn’t practice, I didn’t bother, I could’ve stopped myself having those dreams, Hermione kept telling me to do it, if I had he’d never have been able to show me where to go, and - Sirius wouldn’t - Sirius wouldn’t\" Something was erupting inside Harry’s head: a need to justify himself, to explain - \"I tried to check he’d really taken Sirius, I went to Umbridge’s office, I spoke to Kreacher in the fire and he said Sirius wasn’t there, he said he’d gone!\" \"Kreacher lied,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"You are not his master, he could lie to you without even needing to punish himself. Kreacher intended you to go to the Ministry of Magic.\" \"He - he sent me on purpose?\" \"Oh yes. Kreacher, I am afraid, has been serving more than one master for months.\" \"How?\" said Harry blankly. \"He hasn’t been out of Grimmauld Place for years.\" \"Kreacher seized his opportunity shortly before Christmas,\" said Dumbledore, \"when Sirius, apparently, shouted at him to ‘get out’. He took Sirius at his word, and interpreted this as an order to leave the house. He went to the only Black family member for whom he had any respect left... Black’s cousin Narcissa, sister of Bellatrix and wife of Lucius Malfoy\" \"How do you know all this?\" Harry said. His heart was beating very fast. He felt sick. He remembered worrying about Kreacher’s odd absence over Christmas, remembered him turning up again in the attic... \"Kreacher told me last night,\" said Dumbledore. \"You see, when you gave Professor Snape that cryptic warning, he realized that you had had a vision of Sirius trapped in the bowels of the Department of Mysteries. He, like you, attempted to contact Sirius at once. I should explain that members of the Order of the Phoenix have more reliable methods of communicating than the fire in Dolores Umbridge’s office. Professor Snape found that Sirius was alive and safe in Grimmauld Place. \"When, however, you did not return from your trip into the Forest with Dolores Umbridge, Professor Snape grew worried that you still believed Sirius to be a captive of Lord Voldemort’s. He alerted certain Order members at once.\" Dumbledore heaved a great sigh and continued, \"Alastor Moody, Nymphadora Tonks, Kingsley Shacklebolt and Remus Lupin were at Headquarters when he made contact. All agreed to go to your aid at once. Professor Snape requested that Sirius remain behind, as he needed somebody to remain at Headquarters to tell me what had happened, for I was due there at any moment. In the meantime he, Professor Snape, intended to search the Forest for you. \"But Sirius did not wish to remain behind while the others went to search for you. He delegated to Kreacher the task of telling me what had happened. And so it was that when I arrived in Grimmauld Place shortly after they had all left for the Ministry, it was the elf who told me - laughing fit to burst - where Sirius had gone.\" \"He was laughing?\" said Harry in a hollow voice. \"Oh, yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"You see, Kreacher was not able to betray us totally. He is not Secret Keeper for the Order, he could not give the Malfoys our whereabouts, or tell them any of the Order’s confidential plans that he had been forbidden to reveal. He was bound by the enchantments of his kind, which is to say that he could not disobey a direct order from his master, Sirius. But he gave Narcissa information of the sort that is very valuable to Voldemort, yet must have seemed much too trivial for Sirius to think of banning him from repeating it.\" \"Like what?\" said Harry. \"Like the fact that the person Sirius cared most about in the world was you,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"Like the fact that you were coming to regard Sirius as a mixture of father and brother. Voldemort knew already, of course, that Sirius was in the Order, and that you knew where he was - but Kreacher’s information made him realize that the one person for whom you would go to any lengths to rescue was Sirius Black.\" Harry’s lips were cold and numb. \"So... when I asked Kreacher if Sirius was there last night...\" \"The Malfoys - undoubtedly on Voldemort’s instructions - had told him he must find a way of keeping Sirius out of the way once you had seen the vision of Sirius being tortured. Then, if you decided to check whether Sirius was at home or not, Kreacher would be able to pretend he was not. Kreacher injured Buckbeak the Hippogriff yesterday, and, at the moment when you made your appearance in the fire, Sirius was upstairs tending to him.\" There seemed to be very little air in Harry’s lungs; his breathing was quick and shallow. \"And Kreacher told you all this... and laughed?\" he croaked. \"He did not wish to tell me,\" said Dumbledore. \"But I am a sufficiently accomplished Legilimens myself to know when I am being lied to and I - persuaded him - to tell me the full story, before I left for the Department of Mysteries.\" \"And,\" whispered Harry, his hands curled in cold fists on his knees, \"and Hermione kept telling us to be nice to him\" \"She was quite right, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. \"I warned Sirius when we adopted twelve Grimmauld Place as our Headquarters that Kreacher must be treated with kindness and respect. I also told him that Kreacher could be dangerous to us. I do not think Sinus took me very seriously, or that he ever saw Kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a human’s\" \"Don’t you blame - don’t you - talk - about Sirius like -\" Harry’s breath was constricted, he could not get the words out properly; but the rage that had subsided briefly flared in him again: he would not let Dumbledore criticize Sirius. \"Kreacher’s a lying - foul - he deserved -\" \"Kreacher is what he has been made by wizards, Harry\" said Dumbledore. \"Yes, he is to be pitied. His existence has been as miserable as your friend Dobby’s. He was forced to do Sirius’s bidding, because Sirius was the last of the family to which he was enslaved, but he felt no true loyalty to him. And whatever Kreacher’s faults, it must be admitted that Sirius did nothing to make Kreacher’s lot easier\" \"DON’T TALK ABOUT SIRIUS LIKE THAT!\" Harry yelled. He was on his feet again, furious, ready to fly at Dumbledore, who had plainly not understood Sirius at all, how brave he was, how much he had suffered... \"What about Snape?\" Harry spat. \"You’re not talking about him, are you? When I told him Voldemort had Sirius he just sneered at me as usual -\" \"Harry, you know Professor Snape had no choice but to pretend not to take you seriously in front of Dolores Umbridge,\" said Dumbledore steadily, \"but as I have explained, he informed the Order as soon as possible about what you had said. It was he who deduced where you had gone when you did not return from the Forest. It was he, too, who gave Professor Umbridge fake Veritaserum when she was attempting to force you to tell her Sirius’s whereabouts.\" Harry disregarded this; he felt a savage pleasure in blaming Snape, it seemed to be easing his own sense of dreadful guilt, and he wanted to hear Dumbledore agree with him. \"Snape - Snape g - goaded Sirius about staying in the house - he made out Sirius was a coward\" \"Sirius was much too old and clever to have allowed such feeble taunts to hurt him,\" said Dumbledore. \"Snape stopped giving me Occlumency lessons!\" Harry snarled. \"He threw me out of his office!\" \"I am aware of it,\" said Dumbledore heavily \"I have already said that it was a mistake for me not to teach you myself, though I was sure, at the time, that nothing could have been more dangerous than to open your mind even further to Voldemort while in my presence -\" \"Snape made it worse, my scar always hurt worse after lessons with him\" Harry remembered Ron’s thoughts on the subject and plunged on \"- how do you know he wasn’t trying to soften me up for Voldemort, make it easier for him to get inside my -\" \"I trust Severus Snape,\" said Dumbledore simply \"But I forgot - another old man’s mistake - that some wounds run too deep for the healing. I thought Professor Snape could overcome his feelings about your father - I was wrong.\" \"But that’s okay, is it?\" yelled Harry, ignoring the scandalized faces and disapproving mutterings of the portraits on the walls. \"It’s okay for Snape to hate my dad, but it’s not okay for Sirius to hate Kreacher?\" \"Sirius did not hate Kreacher,\" said Dumbledore. \"He regarded him as a servant unworthy of much interest or notice. Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike... the fountain we destroyed tonight told a lie. We wizards have mistreated and abused our fellows for too long, and we are now reaping our reward.\" \"SO SIRIUS DESERVED WHAT HE GOT, DID HE?\" Harry yelled. \"I did not say that, nor will you ever hear me say it,\" Dumbledore replied quietly. \"Sirius was not a cruel man, he was kind to house-elves in general. He had no love for Kreacher, because Kreacher was a living reminder of the home Sirius had hated.\" \"Yeah, he did hate it!\" said Harry, his voice cracking, turning his back on Dumbledore and walking away. The sun was bright inside the room now and the eyes of all the portraits followed him as he walked, without realizing what he was doing, without seeing the office at all. \"You made him stay shut up in that house and he hated it, that’s why he wanted to get out last night\" \"I was trying to keep Sirius alive,\" said Dumbledore quietly \"People don’t like being locked up!\" Harry said furiously, rounding on him. \"You did it to me all last summer\" Dumbledore closed his eyes and buried his face in his longfingered hands. Harry watched him, but this uncharacteristic sign of exhaustion, or sadness, or whatever it was from Dumbledore, did not soften him. On the contrary, he felt even angrier that Dumbledore was showing signs of weakness. He had no business being weak when Harry wanted to rage and storm at him. Dumbledore lowered his hands and surveyed Harry through his half-moon glasses. \"It is time,\" he said, \"for me to tell you what I should have told you five years ago, Harry. Please sit down. I am going to tell you everything. I ask only a little patience. You will have your chance to rage at me - to do whatever you like - when I have finished. I will not stop you.\" Harry glared at him for a moment, then flung himself back into the chair opposite Dumbledore and waited. Dumbledore stared for a moment at the sunlit grounds outside the window, then looked back at Harry and said, \"Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, as I had planned and intended. Well - not quite whole. You had suffered. I knew you would when I left you on your aunt and uncle’s doorstep. I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years.\" He paused. Harry said nothing. \"You might ask - and with good reason - why it had to be so. Why could some wizarding family not have taken you in? Many would have done so more than gladly, would have been honored and delighted to raise you as a son. \"My answer is that my priority was to keep you alive. You were in more danger than perhaps anyone but I realized. Voldemort had been vanquished hours before, but his supporters - and many of them are almost as terrible as he - were still at large, angry, desperate and violent. And I had to make my decision, too, with regard to the years ahead. Did I believe that Voldemort was gone for ever? No. I knew not whether it would be ten, twenty or fifty years before he returned, but I was sure he would do so, and I was sure, too, knowing him as I have done, that he would not rest until he killed you. \"I knew that Voldemort’s knowledge of magic is perhaps more extensive than any wizard alive. I knew that even my most complex and powerful protective spells and charms were unlikely to be invincible if he ever returned to full power. \"But I knew, too, where Voldemort was weak. And so I made my decision. You would be protected by an ancient magic of which he knows, which he despises, and which he has always, therefore, underestimated - to his cost. I am speaking, of course, of the fact that your mother died to save you. She gave you a lingering protection he never expected, a protection that flows in your veins to this day. I put my trust, therefore, in your mother’s blood. I delivered you to her sister, her only remaining relative.\" \"She doesn’t love me,\" said Harry at once. \"She doesn’t give a damn -\" \"But she took you,\" Dumbledore cut across him. \"She may have taken you grudgingly, furiously, unwillingly, bitterly, yet still she took you, and in doing so, she sealed the charm I placed upon you. Your mother’s sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you.\" \"I still don’t.\" \"While you can still call home the place where your mother’s blood dwells, there you cannot be touched or harmed by Voldemort. He shed her blood, but it lives on in you and her sister. Her blood became your refuge. You need return there only once a year, but as long as you can still call it home, while you are there he cannot hurt you. Your aunt knows this. I explained what I had done in the letter I left, with you, on her doorstep. She knows that allowing you houseroom may well have kept you alive for the past fifteen years.\" \"Wait,\" said Harry. \"Wait a moment.\" He sat up straighter in his chair, staring at Dumbledore. \"You sent that Howler. You told her to remember - it was your voice -\" \"I thought,\" said Dumbledore, inclining his head slightly, \"that she might need reminding of the pact she had sealed by taking you. I suspected the Dementor attack might have awoken her to the dangers of having you as a surrogate son.\" \"It did,\" said Harry quietly. \"Well - my uncle more than her. He wanted to chuck me out, but after the Howler came she - she said I had to stay\" He stared at the floor for a moment, then said, \"But what’s this got to do with - \" He could not say Sirius’s name. \"Five years ago, then,\" continued Dumbledore, as though he had not paused in his story, \"you arrived at Hogwarts, neither as happy nor as well-nourished as I would have liked, perhaps, yet alive and healthy. You were not a pampered little prince, but as normal a boy as I could have hoped under the circumstances. Thus far, my plan was working well. \"And then... well, you will remember the events of your first year at Hogwarts quite as clearly as I do. You rose magnificently to the challenge that faced you and sooner - much sooner - than I had anticipated, you found yourself face to face with Voldemort. You survived again. You did more. You delayed his return to full power and strength. You fought a man’s fight. I was... prouder of you than I can say. \"Yet there was a flaw in this wonderful plan of mine,\" said Dumbledore. \"An obvious flaw that I knew, even then, might be the undoing of it all. And yet, knowing how important it was that my plan should succeed, I told myself that I would not permit this flaw to ruin it. I alone could prevent this, so I alone must be strong. And here was my first test, as you lay in the hospital wing, weak from your struggle with Voldemort.\" \"I don’t understand what you’re saying,\" said Harry. \"Don’t you remember asking me, as you lay in the hospital wing, why Voldemort had tried to kill you when you were a baby?\" Harry nodded. \"Ought I to have told you then?\" Harry stared into the blue eyes and said nothing, but his heart was racing again. \"You do not see the flaw in the plan yet? No... perhaps not. Well, as you know, I decided not to answer you. Eleven, I told myself, was much too young to know. I had never intended to tell you when you were eleven. The knowledge would be too much at such a young age. \"I should have recognized the danger signs then. I should have asked myself why I did not feel more disturbed that you had already asked me the question to which I knew, one day, I must give a terrible answer. I should have recognized that I was too happy to think that I did not have to do it on that particular day... YOU were too young, much too young. \"And so we entered your second year at Hogwarts. And once again you met challenges even grown wizards have never faced: once again you acquitted yourself beyond my wildest dreams. You did not ask me again, however, why Voldemort had left that mark on you. We discussed your scar, oh yes... we came very, very close to the subject. Why did I not tell you everything? \"Well, it seemed to me that twelve was, after all, hardly better than eleven to receive such information. I allowed you to leave my presence, bloodstained, exhausted but exhilarated, and if I felt a twinge of unease that I ought, perhaps, to have told you then, it was swiftly silenced. You were still so young, you see, and I could not find it in myself to spoil that night of triumph... \"Do you see, Harry? Do you see the flaw in my brilliant plan now? I had fallen into the trap I had foreseen, that I had told myself I could avoid, that I must avoid.\" \"I don’t -\" \"I cared about you too much,\" said Dumbledore simply. \"I cared more for your happiness than your knowing the truth, more for your peace of mind than my plan, more for your life than the lives that might be lost if the plan failed. In other words, I acted exactly as Voldemort expects we fools who love to act. \"Is there a Defense? I defy anyone who has watched you as I have - and I have watched you more closely than you can have imagined - not to want to save you more pain than you had already suffered. What did I care if numbers of nameless and faceless people and creatures were slaughtered in the vague future, if in the here and now you were alive, and well, and happy? I never dreamed that I would have such a person on my hands. \"We entered your third year. I watched from afar as you struggled to repel Dementors, as you found Sirius, learned what he was and rescued him. Was I to tell you then, at the moment when you had triumphantly snatched your godfather from the jaws of the Ministry? But now, at the age of thirteen, my excuses were running out. Young you might be, but you had proved you were exceptional. My conscience was uneasy, Harry. I knew the time must come soon... \"But you came out of the maze last year, having watched Cedric Diggory die, having escaped death so narrowly yourself... and I did not tell you, though I knew, now Voldemort had returned, I must do it soon. And now, tonight, I know you have long been ready for the knowledge I have kept from you for so long, because you have proved that I should have placed the burden upon you before this. My only Defense is this: I have watched you struggling under more burdens than any student who as ever passed through this school and I could not bring myself to add another - the greatest one of all.\" Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not speak. \"I still don’t understand.\" \"Voldemort tried to kill you when you were a child because of a prophecy made shortly before your birth. He knew the prophecy had been made, though he did not know its full contents. He set out to kill you when you were still a baby, believing he was fulfilling the terms of the prophecy. He discovered, to his cost, that he was mistaken, when the curse intended to kill you backfired. And so, since his return to his body, and particularly since your extraordinary escape from him last year, he has been determined to hear that prophecy in its entirety. This is the weapon he has been seeking so assiduously since his return: the knowledge of how to destroy you.\" The sun had risen fully now: Dumbledore’s office was bathed in it. The glass case in which the sword of Godric Gryffindor resided gleamed white and opaque, the fragments of the instruments Harry had thrown to the floor glistened like raindrops, and behind him, the baby Fawkes made soft chirruping noises in his nest of ashes. \"The prophecy’s smashed,\" Harry said blankly. \"I was pulling Neville up those benches in the - the room where the archway was, and I ripped his robes and it fell...\" \"The thing that smashed was merely the record of the prophecy kept by the Department of Mysteries. But the prophecy was made to somebody, and that person has the means of recalling it perfectly\" \"Who heard it?\" asked Harry, though he thought he knew the answer already \"I did,\" said Dumbledore. \"On a cold, wet night sixteen years ago, in a room above the bar at the Hog’s Head inn. I had gone there to see an applicant for the post of Divination teacher, though it was against my inclination to allow the subject of Divination to continue at all. The applicant, however, was the great-great-granddaughter of a very famous, very gifted Seer and I thought it common politeness to meet her. I was disappointed. It seemed to me that she had not a trace of the gift herself. I told her, courteously I hope, that I did not think she would be suitable for the post. I turned to leave.\" Dumbledore got to his feet and walked past Harry to the black cabinet that stood beside Fawkes’s perch. He bent down, slid back a catch and took from inside it the shallow stone basin, carved with runes around the edges, in which Harry had seen his father tormenting Snape. Dumbledore walked back to the desk, placed the Pensieve upon it, and raised his wand to his own temple. From it, he withdrew silvery, gossamer-fine strands of thought clinging to the wand and deposited them into the basin. He sat back down behind his desk and watched his thoughts swirl and drift inside the Pensieve for a moment. Then, with a sigh, he raised his wand and prodded the silvery substance with its tip. A figure rose out of it, draped in shawls, her eyes magnified to enormous size behind her glasses, and she revolved slowly; her feet in the basin. But when Sibyll Trelawney spoke, it was not in her usual ethereal, mystic voice, but in the harsh, hoarse tones Harry had heard her use once before: \"The one with the power to vanquish the - Dark Lord approaches... born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies... and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not... and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives... the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies...\" The slowly revolving Professor Trelawney sank back into the silver mass below and vanished. The silence within the office was absolute. Neither Dumbledore nor Harry nor any of the portraits made a sound. Even Fawkes had fallen silent. \"Professor Dumbledore?\" Harry said very quietly, for Dumbledore, still staring at the Pensieve, seemed completely lost in thought. \"It... did that mean... what did that mean?\" \"It meant,\" said Dumbledore, \"that the person who has the only chance of conquering Lord Voldemort for good was born at the end of July, nearly sixteen years ago. This boy would be born to parents who had already defied Voldemort three times.\" Harry felt as though something was closing in on him. His breathing seemed difficult again. \"It means - me?\" Dumbledore surveyed him for a moment through his glasses. \"The odd thing, Harry,\" he said softly, \"is that it may not have meant you at all. Sibyll’s prophecy could have applied to two wizard boys, both born at the end of July that year, both of whom had parents in the Order of the Phoenix, both sets of parents having narrowly escaped Voldemort three times. One, of course, was you. The other was Neville Longbottom.\" \"But then... but then, why was it my name on the prophecy and not Neville’s?\" \"The official record was re-labeled after Voldemort’s attack on you as a child,\" said Dumbledore. \"It seemed plain to the keeper of the Hall of Prophecy that Voldemort could only have tried to kill you because he knew you to be the one to whom Sibyll was referring.\" \"Then - it might not be me?\" said Harry \"I am afraid,\" said Dumbledore slowly, looking as though every word cost him a great effort, \"that there is no doubt that it is you.\" \"But you said - Neville was born at the end of July, too - and his mum and dad -\" \"You are forgetting the next part of the prophecy, the final identifying feature of the boy who could vanquish Voldemort... Voldemort himself would mark him as his equal. And so he did, Harry. He chose you, not Neville. He gave you the scar that has proved both blessing and curse.\" \"But he might have chosen wrong!\" said Harry. \"He might have marked the wrong person!\" \"He chose the boy he thought most likely to be a danger to him,\" said Dumbledore. \"And notice this, Harry: he chose, not the pureblood (which, according to his creed, is the only kind of wizard worth being or knowing) but the half-blood, like himself. He saw himself in you before he had ever seen you, and in marking you with that scar, he did not kill you, as he intended, but gave you powers, and a future, which have fitted you to escape him not once, but four times so far - something that neither your parents, nor Neville’s parents, ever achieved.\" \"Why did he do it, then?\" said Harry, who felt numb and cold. \"Why did he try and kill me as a baby? He should have waited to see whether Neville or I looked more dangerous when we were older and tried to kill whoever it was then -\" \"That might, indeed, have been the more practical course,\" said Dumbledore, \"except that Voldemort’s information about the prophecy was incomplete. The Hog’s Head inn, which Sibyll chose for its cheapness, has long attracted, shall we say, a more interesting clientele than the Three Broomsticks. As you and your friends found out to your cost, and I to mine that night, it is a place where it is never safe to assume you are not being overheard. Of course, I had not dreamed, when I set out to meet Sibyll Trelawney, that I would hear anything worth overhearing. My - our - one stroke of good fortune was that the eavesdropper was detected only a short way into the prophecy and thrown from the building.\" \"So he only heard -?\" \"He heard only the beginning, the part foretelling the birth of a boy in July to parents who had thrice defied Voldemort. Consequently, he could not warn his master that to attack you would be to risk transferring power to you, and marking you as his equal. So Voldemort never knew that there might be danger in attacking you, that it might be wise to wait, to learn more. He did not know that you would have power the Dark Lord knows not-\" \"But I don’t!\" said Harry, in a strangled voice. \"I haven’t any powers he hasn’t got, I couldn’t fight the way he did tonight, I can’t possess people or - or kill them -\" \"There is a room in the Department of Mysteries,\" interrupted Dumbledore, \"that is kept locked at all times. It contains a force that is at once more wonderful and more terrible than death, than human intelligence, than the forces of nature. It is also, perhaps, the most mysterious of the many subjects for study that reside there. It is the power held within that room that you possess in such quantities and which Voldemort has not at all. That power took you to save Sirius tonight. That power also saved you from possession by Voldemort, because he could not bear to reside in a body so full of the force he detests. In the end, it mattered not that you could not close your mind. It was your heart that saved you.\" Harry closed his eyes. If he had not gone to save Sirius, Sirius would not have died... More to stave off the moment when he would have to think of Sirius again, Harry asked, without caring much about the answer, \"The end of the prophecy... it was something about neither... can live...\" \"... while the other survives,\" said Dumbledore. \"So,\" said Harry, dredging up the words from what felt like a deep well of despair inside him, \"so does that mean that... that one of us has got to kill the other one... in the end?\" \"Yes,\" said Dumbledore. For a long time, neither of them spoke. Somewhere far beyond the office walls, Harry could hear the sound of voices, students heading down to the Great Hall for an early breakfast, perhaps. It seemed impossible that there could be people in the world who still desired food, who laughed, who neither knew nor cared that Sirius Black was gone forever. Sirius seemed a million miles away already; even now a part of Harry still believed that if he had only pulled back that veil, he would have found Sirius looking back at him, greeting him, perhaps, with his laugh like a bark... \"I feel I owe you another explanation, Harry,\" said Dumbledore hesitantly. \"You may, perhaps, have wondered why I never chose you as a prefect? I must confess... that I rather thought... you had enough responsibility to be going on with.\" Harry looked up at him and saw a tear trickling down Dumbledore’s face into his long silver beard. \n",

            " The Wedding Three o’clock on the following afternoon found Harry, Ron, Fred and George standing outside the great white marquee in the orchard, awaiting the arrival of the wedding guests. Harry had taken a large dose of Polyjuice Potion and was now the double of a redheaded Muggle boy from the local village, Ottery St. Catchpole, from whom Fred had stolen hairs using a Summoning Charm. The plan was to introduce Harry as \"Cousin Barny\" and trust to the great number of Weasley relatives to camouflage him. All four of them were clutching seating plans, so that they could help show people to the right seats. A host of white-robed waiters had arrived an hour earlier, along with a golden jacketed band, and all of these wizards were currently sitting a short distance away under a tree. Harry could see a blue haze of pipe smoke issuing from the spot. Behind Harry, the entrance to the marquee revealed rows and rows of fragile golden chairs set on either side of a long purple carpet. The supporting poles were entwined with white and gold flowers. Fred and George had fastened an enormous bunch of golden balloons over the exact point where Bill and Fleur would shortly become husband and wife. Outside, butterflies and bees were hovering lazily over the grass and hedgerow. Harry was rather uncomfortable. The Muggle boy whose appearance he was affecting was slightly fatter than him and his dress robes felt hot and tight in the full glare of a summer’s day. \"When I get married,\" said Fred, tugging at the collar of his own robes, \"I won’t be bothering with any of this nonsense. You can all wear what you like, and I’ll put a full Body Bird Curse on Mum until it’s all over.\" \"She wasn’t too bad this morning, considering,\" said George. \"Cried a bit about Percy not being here, but who wants him. Oh blimey, brace yourselves, here they come, look.\" Brightly colored figures were appearing, one by one out of nowhere at the distant boundary of the yard. Within minutes a procession had formed, which began to snake its way up through the garden toward the marquee. Exotic flowers and bewitched birds fluttered on the witches’ hats, while precious gems glittered from many of the wizards’ cravats; a hum of excited chatter grew louder and louder, drowning the sound of the bees as the crowd approached the tent. \"Excellent, I think I see a few veela cousins,\" said George, craning his neck for a better look. \"They’ll need help understanding our English customs, I’ll look after them....\" \"Not so fast, Your Holeyness,\" said Fred, and darting past the gaggle of middle-aged witches heading for the procession, he said, \"Here - permetiez moi to assister vous,\" to a pair of pretty French girls, who giggled and allowed him to escort them inside. George was left to deal with the middle-aged witches and Ron took charge of Mr. Weasley’s old Ministry-colleague Perkins, while a rather deaf old couple fell to Harry’s lot. \"Wotcher,\" said a familiar voice as he came out of the marquee again and found Tonks and Lupin at the front of the queue. She had turned blonde for the occasion. \"Arthur told us you were the one with the curly hair. Sorry about last night,\" she added in a whisper as Harry led them up the aisle. \"The Ministry’s being very anti-werewolf at the museum and we thought our presence might not do you any favors.\" \"It’s fine, I understand,\" said Harry, speaking more to Lupin than Tonks. Lupin gave him a swift smile, but as they turned away Harry saw Lupin’s face fall again into lines of misery. He did not understand it, but there was no time to dwell on the matter. Hagrid was causing a certain amount of disruption. Having misunderstood Fred’s directions as he had sat himself, not upon the magically enlarged and reinforced seat set aside for him in the back row, but on five sets that now resembled a large pile of golden matchsticks. While Mr. Weasley repaired the damage and Hagrid shouted apologies to anybody who would listen, Harry hurried back to the entrance to find Ron face-to-face with a most eccentric-looking wizard. Slightly cross-eyed, with shoulder-length white hair the texture of candyfloss, he wore a cap whose tassel dangled in front of his nose and robes of an eye-watering shade of egg-yolk yellow. An odd symbol, rather like a triangular eye, glistened from a golden chain around his neck. \"Xenophilius Lovegood,\" he said, extending a hand to Harry, \"my daughter and I live just over the hill, so kind of the good Weasleys to invite us. But I think you know my Luna?\" he added to Ron. \"Yes,\" said Ron. \"Isn’t she with you?\" \"She lingered in that charming little garden to say hello to the gnomes, such a glorious infestation! How few wizards realize just how much we can learn from the wise little gnomes - or, to give them their correct name, the Gernumbli gardensi.\" \"Ours do know a lot of excellent swear words,\" said Ron, \"but I think Fred and George taught them those.\" He led a party of warlocks into the marquee as Luna rushed up. \"Hello, Harry!\" she said. \"Er - my name’s Barry,\" said Harry, flummoxed. \"Oh, have you changed that too?\" she asked brightly. \"How did you know -?\" \"Oh, just your expression,\" she said. Like her father, Luna was wearing bright yellow robes, which she had accessorized with a large sunflower in her hair. Once you get over the brightness of it all, the general effect was quite pleasant. At least there were no radishes dangling from her ears. Xenophilius, who was deep in conversation with an acquaintance, had missed the exchange between Luna and Harry. Biding the wizard farewell, he turned to his daughter, who held up her finger and said, \"Daddy, look - one of the gnomes actually bit me.\" \"How wonderful! Gnome saliva is enormously beneficial.\" Said Mr. Lovegood, seizing Luna’s outstretched fingers and examining the bleeding puncture marks. \"Luna, my love, if you should feel any burgeoning talent today - perhaps an unexpected urge to sing opera or to declaims in Mermish - do not repress it! You may have been gifted by the Gernumblies!\" Ron, passing them in the opposite direction let out a loud snort. \"Ron can laugh,\" said Luna serenely as Harry led her and Xenophilius toward their seats, \"but my father has done a lot of research on Gernumbli magic.\" \"Really?\" said Harry, who had long since decided not to challenge Luna or her father’s peculiar views. \"Are you sure you don’t want to put anything on that bite, though?\" \"Oh, it’s fine,\" said Luna, sucking her finger in a dreamy fashion and looking Harry up and down. \"You look smart. I told Daddy most people would probably wear dress robes, but he believes you ought to wear sun colors to a wedding, for luck, you know.\" As she drifted off after her father, Ron reappeared with an elderly witch clutching his arm. Her beaky nose, red-rimmed eyes, and leathery pink hat gave her the look of a bad-tempered flamingo. \"...and your hair’s much too long, Ronald, for a moment I thought you were Ginevra. Merlin’s beard, what is Xenophilius Lovegood wearing? He looks like an omelet. And who are you?\" she barked at Harry. \"Oh yeah, Auntie Muriel, this is our cousin Barny.\" \"Another Weasley? You breed like gnomes. Isn’t Harry Potter here? I was hoping to meet him. I thought he was a friend of yours, Ronald, or have you merely been boasting?\" \"No - he couldn’t come -\" \"Hmm. Made an excuse, did he? Not as gormless as he looks in press photographs, then. I’ve just been instructing the bride on how best to wear my tiara,\" she shouted at Harry. \"Goblin-made, you know, and been in my family for centuries. She’s a good-looking girl, but still - French. Well, well, find me a good seat, Ronald, I am a hundred and seven and I ought not to be on my feet too long.\" Ron gave Harry a meaningful look as he passed and did not reappear for some time. When next they met at the entrance, Harry had shown a dozen more people to their places. The Marquee was nearly full now and for the first time there was no queue outside. \"Nightmare, Muriel is,\" said Ron, mopping his forehead on his sleeve. \"She used to come for Christmas every year, then, thank God, she took offense because Fred and George set off a Dungbomb under her chair at diner. Dad always says she’ll have written them out of her will - like they care, they’re going to end up richer than anyone in the family, rate they’re going... Wow,\" he added, blinking rather rapidly as Hermione came hurrying toward them. \"You look great!\" \"Always the tone of surprise,\" said Hermione, though she smiled. She was wearing a floaty, lilac-colored dress with matching high heels; her hair was sleek and shiny. \"Your Great-Aunt Muriel doesn’t agree, I just met her upstairs while she was giving Fleur the tiara. She said, ‘Oh dear, is this the Muggle-born?’ and then, ‘Bad posture and skinny ankles.’\" \"Don’t take it personally, she’s rude to everyone,\" said Ron. \"Talking about Muriel?\" inquired George, reemerging from the marquee with Fred. \"Yeah, she’s just told me my ears are lopsided. Old bat. I wish old Uncle Bilius was still with us, though; he was a right laugh at weddings.\" \"Wasn’t he the one who saw a Grim and died twenty-four hours later?\" asked Hermione. \"Well, yeah, he went a bit odd toward the end,\" conceded George. \"But before he went loopy he was the life and soul of the party,\" said Fred. \"He used to down an entire bottle of firewhisky, then run onto the dance floor, hoist up his robes, and start pulling bunches of flowers out of his -\" \"Yes, he sounds a real charmer,\" said Hermione, while Harry roared with laughter. \"Never married, for some reason,\" said Ron. \"You amaze me,\" said Hermione. They were all laughing so much that none of them noticed the latecomer, a dark-haired young man with a large, curved nose and thick black eyebrows, until he held out his invitation to Ron and said, with his eyes on Hermione, \"You look vunderful.\" \"Viktor!\" she shrieked, and dropped her small beaded bag, which made a loud thump quite disproportionate to its size. As she scrambled, blushing, to pick it up, she said \"I didn’t know you were - goodness - it’s lovely to see - how are you?\" Ron’s ears had turned bright red again. After glancing at Krum’s invitation as if he did not believe a word of it, he said, much too loudly, \"how come you’re here?\" \"Fleur invited me,\" said Krum, eyebrows raised. Harry, who had no grudge against Krum, shook hands; then feeling that it would be prudent to remove Krum from Ron’s vicinity, offered to show him his seat. \"Your friend is not pleased to see me,\" said Krum, as they entered the now packed marquee. \"Or is he a relative?\" he added with a glance at Harry’s red curly hair. \"Cousin.\" Harry muttered, but Krum was not really listening. His appearance was causing a stir, particularly amongst the veela cousins: He was, after all, a famous Quidditch player. While people were still craning their necks to get a good look at him, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George came hurrying down the aisle. \"Time to sit down,\" Fred told Harry, \"or we’re going to get run over by the bride.\" Harry, Ron and Hermione took their seats in the second row behind Fred and George. Hermione looked rather pink and Ron’s ears were still scarlet. After a few moments he muttered to Harry, \"Did you see he’s grown a stupid little beard?\" Harry gave a noncommittal grunt. A sense of jittery anticipation had filled the warm tent, the general murmuring broken by occasional spurts of excited laughter. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley strolled up the aisle, smiling and waving at relatives; Mrs. Weasley was wearing a brand-new set of amethyst colored robes with a matching hat. A moment later Bill and Charlie stood up at the front of the marquee, both wearing dress robes, with larger white roses in their buttonholes; Fred wolf-whistled and there was an outbreak of giggling from the veela cousins. Then the crowd fell silent as music swelled from what seemed to be the golden balloons. \"Ooooh!\" said Hermione, swiveling around in her seat to look at the entrance. A great collective sigh issued from the assembled witches and wizards as Monsieur Delacour and Fleur came walking up the aisle, Fleur gliding, Monsieur Delacour bouncing and beaming. Fleur was wearing a very simple white dress and seemed to be emitting a strong, silvery glow. While her radiance usually dimmed everyone else by comparison, today it beautified everybody it fell upon. Ginny and Gabrielle, both wearing golden dresses, looked even prettier than usual and once Fleur had reached for him, Bill did not look as though he had ever met Fenrit Greyback. \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" said a slightly singsong voice, and with a slight shock, Harry saw the same small, tufty-hired wizard who had presided at Dumbledore’s funeral, now standing in front of Bill and Fleur. \"We are gathered here today to celebrate the union of two faithful souls...\" \"Yes, my tiara set off the whole thing nicely,\" said Auntie Muriel in a rather carrying whisper. \"But I must say, Ginevra’s dress is far too low cut.\" Ginny glanced around, grinning, winked at Harry, then quickly faced the front again. Harry’s mind wandered a long way from the marquee, back to the afternoons spent alone with Ginny in lonely parts of the school grounds. They seemed so long ago; they had always seemed too good to be true, as though he had been stealing shining hours from a normal person’s life, a person without a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead.... \"Do you, William Arthur, take Fleur Isabelle...?\" In the front row, Mrs. Weasley and Madame Delacour were both sobbing quietly into scraps of lace. Trumpetlike sounds from the back of the marquee told everyone that Hagrid had taken out one of his own tablecloth-sized handkerchiefs. Hermione turned around and beamed at Harry; her eyes too were full of tears. \"...then I declare you bonded for life.\" The tufty-haired wizard waved his hand high over the heads of Bill and Fleur and a shower of silver stars fell upon them, spiraling around their now entwined figures. As Fred and George led a round of applause, the golden balloons overhead burst. Birds of paradise and tiny golden bells flew and floated out of them, adding their songs and chimes to the din. \"Ladies and gentlemen!\" called the tufty-haired wizard. \"If you would please stand up!\" They all did so, Auntie Muriel grumbling audibly; he waved his wand again. The scars on which they had been sitting rose gracefully into the air as the canvas walls of the marquee vanished, so that they stood beneath a canopy supported by golden poles, with a glorious view of the sunlit orchard and surrounding countryside. Next, a pool of molten gold spread from the center of the tent to form a gleaming dance floor; the hovering chairs grouped themselves around small, white-clothed tables, which all floated gracefully back to earth round it, and the golden-jacketed hand trooped toward a podium. \"Smooth,\" said Ron approvingly as the waiters popped up on all sides, some hearing silver trays of pumpkin juice, butterbeer, and firewhisky, others tottering piles of tarts and sandwiches. \"We should go and congratulate them!\" said Hermione, standing on tiptoe to see the place where Bill and Fleur had vanished amid a crowd of well-wishers. \"We’ll have time later,\" shrugged Ron, snatching three butterbeers from a passing tray and handing one to Harry. \"Hermione, cop hold, let’s grab a table.... Not there! Nowhere near Muriel -\" Ron led the way across the empty dance floor, glancing left and right as he went; Harry felt sure that he was keeping an eye out for Krum. By the time they had reached the other side of the marquee, most of the tables were occupied: The emptiest was the one where Luna sat alone. \"All right if we join you?\" asked Ron. \"Oh yes,\" she said happily. \"Daddy’s just gone to give Bill and Fleur our present.\" \"What is it, a lifetime’s supply of Gurdyroots?\" asked Ron. Hermione aimed a kick at him under the table, but caught Harry instead. Eyes watering in pain, Harry lost track of the conversation for a few moments. The band had begun to play, Bill and Fleur took to the dance floor first, to great applause; after a while, Mr. Weasley led Madame Delacour onto the floor, followed by Mr. Weasley and Fleur’s father. \"I like this song,\" said Luna, swaying in time to the waltzlike tune, and a few seconds later she stood up and glided onto the dance floor, where she revolved on the spot, quite alone, eyes closed and waving her arms. \"She’s great isn’t she?\" said Ron admiringly. \"Always good value.\" But the smile vanished from his face at once: Viktor Krum had dropped into Luna’s vacant seat. Hermione looked pleasurably flustered but this time Krum had not come to compliment her. With a scowl on his face he said, \"Who is that man in the yellow?\" \"That’s Xenophilius Lovegood, he’s the father of a friend of ours,\" said Ron. His pugnacious tone indicated that they were not about to laugh at Xenophilius, despite the clear provocation. \"Come and dance,\" he added abruptly to Hermione. She looked taken aback, but pleased too, and got up. They vanished together into the growing throng on the dance floor. \"Ah, they are together now?\" asked Krum, momentarily distracted. \"Er - sort of,\" said Harry. \"Who are you?\" Krum asked. \"Barny Weasley.\" They shook hands. \"You, Barny - you know this man Lovegood well?\" \"No, I only met him today. Why?\" Krum glowered over the top of his drink, watching Xenophilius, who was chatting to several warlocks on the other side of the dance floor. \"Because,\" said Krum, \"If he vus not a guest of Fleur’s I vould dud him, here and now, for veering that filthy sign upon his chest.\" \"Sign?\" said Harry, looking over at Xenophilius too. The strange triangular eye was gleaming on his chest. \"Why? What’s wrong with it?\" \"Grindelvald. That is Grindelvald’s sign.\" \"Grindelwald... the Dark wizard Dumbledore defeated?\" \"Exactly.\" Krum’s jaw muscles worked as if he were chewing, then he said, \"Grindelvald killed many people, my grandfather, for instance. Of course, he vos never powerful in this country, they said he feared Dumbledore - and rightly, seeing how he vos finished. But this\" - he pointed a finger at Xenophilius - \"this is his symbol, I recognized it at vunce: Grindelvald carved it into a vall at Durmstrang ver he vos a pupil there. Some idiots copied it onto their books and clothes thinking to shock, make themselves impressive - until those of us who had lost family members to Grindelvald taught them better.\" Krum cracked his knuckles menacingly and glowered at Xenophilius. Harry felt perplexed. It seemed incredibly unlikely that Luna’s father was a supporter of the Dark Arts, and nobody else in the tent seemed to have recognized the triangular, finlike shape. \"Are you - er - quite sure it’s Grindelwald’s -?\" \"I am not mistaken,\" said Krum coldly. \"I walked past that sign for several years, I know it vell.\" \"Well, there’s a chance,\" said Harry, \"that Xenophilius doesn’t actually know what the symbol means, the Lovegoods are quite... unusual. He could have easily picked it up somewhere and think it’s a cross section of the head of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack or something.\" \"The cross section of a vot?\" \"Well, I don’t know what they are, but apparently he and his daughter go on holiday looking for them....\" Harry felt he was doing a bad job explaining Luna and her father. \"That’s her,\" he said, pointing at Luna, who was still dancing alone, waving her arms around her head like someone attempting to beat off midges. \"Vy is she doing that?\" asked Krum. \"Probably trying to get rid of a Wrackspurt,\" said Harry, who recognized the symptoms. Krum did not seem to know whether or not Harry was making fun of him. He drew his hand from inside his robe and tapped it menacingly on his thighs; sparks flew out of the end. \"Gregorovitch!\" said Harry loudly, and Krum started, but Harry was too excited to care; the memory had come back to him at the sight of Krum’s wand: Ollivander taking it and examining it carefully before the Triwizard Tournament. \"Vot about him?\" asked Krum suspiciously. \"He’s a wandmaker!\" \"I know that,\" said Krum. \"He made your wand! That’s why I thought - Quidditch -\" Krum was looking more and more suspicious. \"How do you know Gregorovitch made my wand?\" \"I...I read it somewhere, I think,\" said Harry. \"In a - a fan magazine,\" he improvised wildly and Krum looked mollified. \"I had not realized I ever discussed my vand with fans,\" he said. \"So... er... where is Gregorowitch these days?\" Krum looked puzzled. \"He retired several years ago. I was one of the last to purchase a Gregorovitch vand. They are the best -although I know, of course, that your Britons set much store by Ollivander.\" Harry did not answer. He pretended to watch the dancers, like Krum, but he was thinking hard. So Voldemort was looking for a celebrated wandmaker and Harry did not have to search far for a reason. It was surely because of what Harry’ wand had done on the night that Voldemort pursued him across the skies. The holly and phoenix feather wand had conquered the borrowed wand, some thing that Ollivander had not anticipated or understood. Would Gregorowitch know better? Was he truly more skilled than Ollivander, did he know secrets of wands that Ollivander did not? \"This girl is very nice-looking,\" Krum said, recalling Harry to his surroundings. Krum was pointing at Ginny, who had just joined Luna. \"She is also a relative of yours?\" \"Yeah,\" said Harry, suddenly irritated, \"and she’s seeing someone. Jealous type. Big bloke. You wouldn’t want to cross him.\" Krum grunted. \"Vot,\" he said, draining his goblet and getting to his feet again, \"is the point of being an international Quidditch player if all the good-looking girls are taken?\" And he strode off leaving Harry to take a sandwich from a passing waiter and make his way around the edge of the crowded dance floor. He wanted to find Ron, to tell him about Gregorovitch, but he was dancing with Hermione out in the middle of the floor. Harry leaned up against one of the golden pillars and watched Ginny, who was now dancing with Fred and George’s friend Lee Jordan, trying not to feel resentful about the promise he had given Ron. He had never been to a wedding before, so he could not judge how Wizarding celebrations differed from Muggle ones, though he was pretty sure that the latter would not involve a wedding cake topped with two model phoenixes that took flight when the cake was cut, or bottles of champagne that floated unsupported through the crowd. As the evening drew in, and moths began to swoop under the canopy, now lit with floating golden lanterns, the revelry became more and more uncontained. Fred and George had long since disappeared into the darkness with a pair of Fleur’s cousins; Charlie, Hagrid, and a squat wizard in a purple porkpie hat were singing \"Odo the Hero\" in the corner. Wandering through the crowd so as to escape a drunken uncle of Ron’s who seemed unsure whether or not Harry was his son, Harry spotted an old wizard sitting alone at a table. His cloud of white hair made him look rather like an aged dandelion clock and was topped by a moth-eaten fez. He was vaguely familiar: Racking his brains, Harry suddenly realized that this was Elphias Doge, member of the Order of the Phoenix and the writer of Dumbledore’s obituary. Harry approached him. \"May I sit down?\" \"Of course, of course,\" said Doge; he had a rather high-pitched, wheezy voice. Harry leaned in. \"Mr. Doge, I’m Harry Potter.\" Doge gasped. \"My dear boy! Arthur told me you were here, disguised.... I am so glad, so honored!\" In a flutter of nervous pleasure Doge poured Harry a goblet of champagne. \"I thought of writing to you,\" he whispered, \"after Dumbledore... the shock... and for you, I am sure...\" Doge’s tiny eyes filled with sudden tears. \"I saw the obituary you wrote for the Daily Prophet,\" said Harry. \"I didn’t realize you knew Professor Dumbledore so well.\" \"As well as anyone,\" said Doge, dabbing his eyes with a napkin. \"Certainly I knew him longest, if you don’t count Aberforth - and somehow, people never do seem to count Aberforth.\" \"Speaking of the Daily Prophet... I don’t know whether you saw, Mr. Doge -?\" \"Oh, please call me Elphias, dear boy.\" \"Elphias, I don’t know whether you saw the interview Rita Skeeter gave about Dumbledore?\" Doge’s face flooded with angry color. \"Oh yes, Harry, I saw it. That woman, or vulture might be a more accurate term, positively pestered me to talk to her, I am ashamed to say that I became rather rude, called her an interfering trout, which resulted, as you my have seen, in aspersions cast upon my sanity.\" \"Well, in that interview,\" Harry went on, \"Rita Skeeter hinted that Professor Dumbledore was involved in the Dark Arts when he was young.\" \"Don’t believe a word of it!\" said Doge at once. \"Not a word, Harry! Let nothing tarnish your memories of Albus Dumbledore!\" Harry looked into Doge’s earnest, pained face, and felt, not reassured, but frustrated. Did Doge really think it was that easy, that Harry could simply choose not to believe? Didn’t Doge understand Harry’s need to be sure, to know everything?\" Perhaps Doge suspected Harry’s feelings, for he looked concerned and hurried on, \"Harry, Rita Skeeter is a dreadful -\" But he was interrupted by a shrill cackle. \"Rita Skeeter? Oh, I love her, always read her!\" Harry and Doge looked up to see Auntie Muriel standing there, the plumes dancing on her hair, a goblet of champagne in her hand. \"She’s written a book about Dumbledore, you know!\" \"Hello, Muriel,\" said Doge, \"Yes, we were just discussing -\" \"You there! Give me your chair, I’m a hundred and seven!\" Another redheaded Weasley cousin jumped off his seat, looking alarmed, and Auntie Muriel swung it around with surprising strength and plopped herself down upon it between Doge and Harry. \"Hello again, Barry or whatever your name is,\" she said to Harry, \"Now what were you saying about Rita Skeeter, Elphias? You know, she’s written a biography of Dumbledore? I can’t wait to read it. I must remember to place an order at Flourish and Blotts!\" Doge looked stiff and solemn at this but Auntie Muriel drained her goblet and clicked her bony fingers at a passing waiter for a replacement. She took another large gulp of champagne, belched and then said, \"There’s no need to look like a pair of stuffed frogs! Before he became so respected and respectable and all that tosh, there were some mighty funny rumors about Albus!\" \"Ill-informed sniping,\" said Doge, turning radish-colored again. \"You would say that, Elphias,\" cackled Auntie Muriel. \"I noticed how you skated over the sticky patches in that obituary of yours!\" \"I’m sorry you think so,\" said Doge, more coldly still. \"I assure you I was writing from the heart.\" \"Oh, we all know you worshipped Dumbledore; I daresay you’ll still think he was a saint even if it does turn out that he did away with his Squib sister!\" \"Muriel!\" exclaimed Doge. A chill that had nothing to do with the iced champagne was stealing through Harry’s chest. \"What do you mean?\" he asked Muriel. \"Who said his sister was a Squib? I thought she was ill?\" \"Thought wrong, then, didn’t you, Barry!\" said Auntie Muriel, looking delighted at the effect she had produced. \"Anyway, how could you expect to know anything about it! IT all happened years and years before you were even thought of, my dear, and the truth is that those of us who were alive then never knew what really happened. That’s why I can’t wait to find out what Skeeter’s unearthed! Dumbledore kept that sister of his quiet for a long time!\" \"Untrue!\" wheezed Doge, \"Absolutely untrue!\" \"He never told me his sister as a Squib,\" said Harry, without thinking, still cold inside. \"And why on earth would he tell you?\" screeched Muriel, swaying a little in her seat as she attempted to focus upon Harry. \"The reason Albus never spoke about Ariana,\" began Elphias in a voice stiff with emotion, \"is, I should have thought, quite clear. He was so devastated by her death -\" \"Why did nobody ever see her, Elphias?\" squawked Muriel, \"Why did half of us never even know she existed, until they carried the coffin out of the house and held a funeral for her? Where was saintly Albus while Ariana was locked in the cellar? Off being brilliant at Hogwarts, and never mind what was going on in his own house!\" \"What d’you mean, locked in the cellar?\" asked Harry. \"What is this?\" Doge looked wretched. Auntie Muriel cackled again and answered Harry. \"Dumbledore’s mother was a terrifying woman, simply terrifying. Muggle-born, though I heard she pretended otherwise-\" \"She never pretended anything of the sort! Kendra was a fine woman,\" whispered Doge miserably, but Auntie Muriel ignored him. \"- proud and very domineering, the sort of witch who would have been mortified to produce a Squib-\" \"Ariana was not a Squib!\" wheezed Doge. \"So you say, Elphias, but explain, then, why she never attended Hogwarts!\" said Auntie Muriel. She turned back to Harry. \"In our day, Squibs were often hushed up, thought to take it to the extreme of actually imprisoning a little girl in the house and pretending she didn’t exist -\" \"I tell you, that’s not what happened!\" said Doge, but Auntie Muriel steamrollered on, still addressing Harry. Squibs were usually shipped off to Muggle schools and encouraged to integrate into the Muggle community... much kinder than trying to find them a place in the Wizarding world, where they must always be second class, but naturally Kendra Dumbledore wouldn’t have dreamed of letting her daughter go to a Muggle school -\" \"Ariana was delicate!\" said Doge desperately. \"Her health was always too poor to permit her -\" \"- to permit her to leave the house?\" cackled Muriel. \"And yet she was never taken to St. Mungo’s and no Healer was ever summoned to see her!\" \"Really, Muriel, how can you possibly know whether -\" \"For your information, Elphias, my cousin Lancelot was a Healer at St. Mungo’s at the time, and he told my family in strictest confidence that Ariana had never been seen there. All most suspicious, Lancelot thought!\" Doge looked to be on the verge of tears. Auntie Muriel, who seemed to be enjoying herself hugely, snapped her fingers for more champagne. Numbly Harry thought of how the Dursleys had once shut him up, locked him away, kept him out of sight, all for the crime of being a wizard. Had Dumbledore’s sister suffered the same fate in reverse: imprisoned for her lack of magic? And had Dumbledore truly left her to her fate while he went off to Hogwarts to prove himself brilliant and talented? \"Now, if Kendra hadn’t died first,\" Muriel resumed, \"I’d have said that it was she who finished off Ariana -\" \"How can you, Muriel!\" groaned Doge. \"A mother kill her own daughter? Think what you’re saying!\" \"If the mother in question was capable of imprisoning her daughter for years on end, why not?\" shrugged Auntie Muriel. \"But as I say, it doesn’t fit, because Kendra died before Ariana - of what, nobody ever seemed sure-\" \"Yes, Ariana might have made a desperate bid for freedom and killed Kendra in the struggle,\" said Auntie Muriel thoughtfully. \"Shake your head all you like, Elphias. You were at Ariana’s funeral, were you not?\" \"Yes I was,\" said Doge, through trembling lips,\" and a more desperately sad occasion I cannot remember. Albus was heartbroken-\" \"His heart wasn’t the only thing. Didn’t Aberforth break Albus’ nose halfway through the service?\" If Doge had looked horrified before this, it was nothing to how he looked now. Muriel might have stabbed him. She cackled loudly and took another swig of champagne, which dribbled down her chin. \"How do you -?\" croaked Doge. \"My mother was friendly with old Bathilda Bagshot,\" said Auntie Muriel happily. \"Bathilda described the whole thing to mother while I was listening at the door. A coffin-side brawl. The way Bathilda told it, Aberforth shouted that it was all Albus’ fault that Ariana was dead and then punched him in the face. According to Bathilda, Albus did not even defend himself, and that’s odd enough in itself. Albus could have destroyed Aberforth in a duel with both hands tied behind his back. Muriel swigged yet more champagne. The recitation of those old scandals seemed to elate her as much as they horrified Doge. Harry did not know what to think, what to believe. He wanted the truth and yet all Doge did was sit there and bleat feebly that Ariana had been ill. Harry could hardly believe that Dumbledore would not have intervened if such cruelty was happening inside his own house, and yet there was undoubtedly something odd about the story. \"And I’ll tell you something else,\" Muriel said, hiccupping slightly as she lowered her goblet. \"I think Bathilda has spilled the beans to Rita Skeeter. All those hints in Skeeter’s interview about an important source close to the Dumbledores - goodness knows she was there all through the Ariana business, and it would fit!\" \"Bathilda, would never talk to Rita Skeeter!\" whispered Doge. \"Bathilda Bagshot?\" Harry said. \"The author of A History of Magic?\" The name was printed on the front of one of Harry’s textbooks, though admittedly not one of the ones he had read more attentively. \"Yes,\" said Doge, clutching at Harry’s question like a drowning man at a life heir. \"A most gifted magical historian and an old friend of Albus’s.\" \"Quite gaga these days, I’ve heard,\" said Auntie Muriel cheerfully. \"If that is so, it is even more dishonorable for Skeeter to have taken advantage of her,\" said Doge, \"and no reliance can be placed on anything Bathilda may have said!\" \"Oh, there are ways of bringing back memories, and I’m sure Rita Skeeter knows them all,\" said Auntie Muriel \"But even if Bathilda’s completely cuckoo, I’m sure she’d still have old photographs, maybe even letters. She knew the Dumbledores for years.... Well worth a trip to Godric’s Hollow, I’d have thought.\" Harry, who had been taking a sip of butterbeer, choked. Doge banged him on the back as Harry coughed, looking at Auntie Muriel through streaming eyes. Once he had control of his voice again, he asked, \"Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric’s Hollow?\" \"Oh yes, she’s been there forever! The Dumbledores moved there after Percival was imprisoned, and she was their neighbor.\" \"The Dumbledores lived in Godric’s Hollows?\" \"Yes, Barry, that’s what I just said,\" said Auntie Muriel testily. Harry felt drained, empty. Never once, in six years, had Dumbledore told Harry that they had both lived and lost loved ones in Godric’s Hollow. Why? Were Lily and James buried close to Dumbledore’s mother and sister? Had Dumbledore visited their graves, perhaps walked past Lily’s and James’s to do so? And he had never once told Harry ... never bothered to say... And why it was so important, Harry could not explain even to himself, yet he felt it had been tantamount to a lie not to tell him that they had this place and these experiences in common. He stared ahead of him, barely noticing what was going on around him, and did not realize that Hermione had appeared out of the crowd until she drew up a chair beside him. \"I simply can’t dance anymore,\" she panted, slipping of one of her shoes and rubbing the sole of her foot. \"Ron’s gone looking to find more butterbeers. It’s a bit odd. I’ve just seen Viktor storming away from Luna’s father, it looked like they’d been arguing -\" She dropped her voice, staring at him. \"Harry, are you okay?\" Harry did not know where to begin, but it did not matter, at that moment, something large and silver came falling through the canopy over the dance floor. Graceful and gleaming, the lynx landed lightly in the middle of the astonished dancers. Heads turned, as those nearest it froze absurdly in mid-dance. Then the Patronus’s mouth opened wide and it spoke in the loud, deep, slow voice of Kingsley Shacklebolt. \"The Ministry has fallen. Scrimgeour is dead. They are coming.\" \n",

            " THIRTY-FIVE Beyond the Veil Black shapes were emerging out of thin air all around them, blocking their way left and right; eyes glinted through slits in hoods, a dozen lit wand tips were pointing directly at their hearts; Ginny gave a gasp of horror. \"To me, Potter,\" repeated the drawling voice of Lucius Malfoy as he held out his hand, palm up. Harrys insides plummeted sickeningly. They were trapped, and outnumbered two to one. \"To me,\" said Malfoy yet again. \"Where’s Sirius?\" Harry said. Several of the Death Eaters laughed; a harsh female voice from the midst of the shadowy figures to Harry’s left said triumphantly, \"The Dark Lord always knows!\" \"Always,\" echoed Malfoy softly. \"Now, give me the prophecy Potter.\" \"I want to know where Sirius is!\" \"I want to know where Sirius is!\" mimicked the woman to his left. She and her fellow Death Eaters had closed in so that they were mere feet away from Harry and the others, the light from their wands dazzling Harry’s eyes. \"You’ve got him,\" said Harry, ignoring the rising panic in his chest, the dread he had been fighting since they had first entered the ninety-seventh row. \"He’s here. I know he is.\" \"The little baby woke up fwightened and fort what it dweamed was twoo,\" said the woman in a horrible, mock baby voice. Harry felt Ron stir beside him. \"Don’t do anything,\" Harry muttered. \"Not yet -\" The woman who had mimicked him let out a raucous scream of laughter. \"You hear him? You hear him? Giving instructions to the other children as though he thinks of fighting us!\" \"Oh, you don’t know Potter as I do, Bellatrix,\" said Malfoy softly. \"He has a great weakness for heroics; the Dark Lord understands this about him. Now give me the prophecy, Potter.\" \"I know Sirius is here,\" said Harry, though panic w as causing his chest to constrict and he felt as though he could not breathe properly. \"I know you’ve got him!\" More of the Death Eaters laughed, though the woman laughed loudest of all. \"It’s time you learned the difference between life and dreams, Potter,\" said Malfoy. \"Now give me the prophecy, or we start using wands.\" \"Go on, then,\" said Harry, raising his own wand to chest height. As he did so, the five wands of Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny and Luna rose on either side of him. The knot in Harry’s stomach tightened. If Sirius really was not here, he had led his friends to their deaths for no reason at all... But the Death Eaters did not strike. \"Hand over the prophecy and no one need get hurt,\" said Malfoy coolly. It was Harry’s turn to laugh. \"Yeah, right!\" he said. \"I give you this - prophecy, is it? And you’ll just let us skip off home, will you?\" The words were hardly out of his mouth when the female Death Eater shrieked: \"Accio proph--\" Harry was just ready for her: he shouted \"Protego!\" before she had finished her spell, and though the glass sphere slipped to the tips of his fingers he managed to cling on to it. \"Oh, he knows how to play, little bitty baby Potter,\" she said, her mad eyes staring through the slits in her hood. \"Very well, then -\" \"I TOLD YOU, NO!\" Lucius Malfoy roared at the woman. \"If you smash it -!\" Harry’s mind was racing. The Death Eaters wanted this dusty spun-glass sphere. He had no interest in it. He just wanted to get them all out of this alive, to make sure none of his friends paid a terrible price for his stupidity... The woman stepped forward, away from her fellows, and pulled off her hood. Azkaban had hollowed Bellatrix Lestrange’s face, making it gaunt and skull-like, but it was alive with a feverish, fanatical glow. \"You need more persuasion?\" she said, her chest rising and falling rapidly. \"Very well - take the smallest one,\" she ordered the Death Eaters beside her. \"Let him watch while we torture the little girl. I’ll do it.\" Harry felt the others close in around Ginny; he stepped sideways so that he was right in front of her, the prophecy held up to his chest. \"You’ll have to smash this if you want to attack any of us,\" he told Bellatrix. \"I don’t think your boss will be too pleased if you come back without it, will he?\" She did not move; she merely stared at him, the tip of her tongue moistening her thin mouth. \"So,\" said Harry, \"what kind of prophecy are we talking about, anyway?\" He could not think what to do but to keep talking. Neville’s arm was pressed against his, and he could feel him shaking; he could feel one of the others’ quickened breath on the back of his head. He was hoping they were all thinking hard about ways to get out of this, because his mind was blank. \"What kind of prophecy?\" repeated Bellatrix, the grin fading from her face. \"You jest, Harry Potter.\" \"Nope, not jesting,\" said Harry, his eyes flicking from Death Eater to Death Eater, looking for a weak link, a space through which they could escape. \"How come Voldemort wants it?\" Several of the Death Eaters let out low hisses. \"You dare speak his name?\" whispered Bellatrix. \"Yeah,\" said Harry, maintaining his tight grip on the glass ball, expecting another attempt to bewitch it from him. \"Yeah, I’ve got no problem with saying Vol--\" \"Shut your mouth!\" Bellatrix shrieked. \"You dare speak his name with your unworthy lips, you dare besmirch it with your half-blood’s tongue, you dare -\" \"Did you know he’s a half-blood too?\" said Harry recklessly. Hermione gave a little moan in his ear. \"Voldemort? Yeah, his mother was a witch but his dad was a Muggle - or has he been telling you lot he’s pure-blood?\" \"STUPEF--\" \"NO!\" A jet of red light had shot from the end of Bellatrix Lestrange’s wand, but Malfoy had deflected it; his spell caused hers to hit the shelf a foot to the left of Harry and several of the glass orbs there shattered. Two figures, pearly-white as ghosts, fluid as smoke, unfurled themselves from the fragments of broken glass upon the floor and each began to speak; their voices vied with each other, so that only fragments of what they were saying could be heard over Malfoy and Bellatrix’s shouts. \"... at the solstice will come a new...\" said the figure of an old, bearded man. \"DO NOT ATTACK! WE NEED THE PROPHECY!\" \"He dared - he dares -\" shrieked Bellatrix incoherently, \"he stands there - filthy half-blood -\" \"WAIT UNTIL WE’VE GOT THE PROPHECY!\" bawled Malfoy. \"... and none will come after...\" said the figure of a young woman. The two figures that had burst from the shattered spheres had melted into thin air. Nothing remained of them or their erstwhile homes but fragments of glass upon the floor. They had, however, given Harry an idea. The problem was going to be conveying it to the others. \"You haven’t told me what’s so special about this prophecy I’m supposed to be handing over,\" he said, playing for time. He moved his foot slowly sideways, feeling around for someone else’s. \"Do not play games with us, Potter,\" said Malfoy. \"I’m not playing games,\" said Harry, half his mind on the conversation, half on his wandering foot. And then he found someone’s toes and pressed down upon them. A sharp intake of breath behind him told him they were Hermiones. \"What?\" she whispered. \"Dumbledore never told you the reason you bear that scar was hidden in the bowels of the Department of Mysteries?\" Malfoy sneered. \"I - what?\" said Harry. And for a moment he quite forgot his plan. \"What about my scar?\" \"What?\" whispered Hermione more urgently behind him. \"Can this be?\" said Malfoy, sounding maliciously delighted; some of the Death Eaters were laughing again, and under cover of their laughter, Harry hissed to Hermione, moving his lips as little as possible, \"Smash shelves -\" \"Dumbledore never told you?\" Malfoy repeated. \"Well, this explains why you didn’t come earlier, Potter, the Dark Lord wondered why -\" \"- when I say now-\" \"- you didn’t come running when he showed you the place where it was hidden in your dreams. He thought natural curiosity would make you want to hear the exact wording...\" \"Did he?\" said Harry. Behind him he felt rather than heard Hermione passing his message to the others and he sought to keep talking, to distract the Death Eaters. \"So he wanted me to come and get it, did he? Why?\" \"Why?\" Malfoy sounded incredulously delighted. \"Because the only people who are permitted to retrieve a prophecy from the Department of Mysteries, Potter, are those about whom it was made, as the Dark Lord discovered when he attempted to use others to steal it for him.\" \"And why did he want to steal a prophecy about me?\" \"About both of you, Potter, about both of you... haven’t you ever wondered why the Dark Lord tried to kill you as a baby?\" Harry stared into the slitted eye-holes through which Malfoy’s grey eyes were gleaming. Was this prophecy the reason Harry’s parents had died, the reason he carried his lightning-bolt scar? Was the answer to all of this clutched in his hand? \"Someone made a prophecy about Voldemort and me?\" he said quietly, gazing at Lucius Malfoy, his fingers tightening over the warm glass sphere in his hand. It was hardly larger than a Snitch and still gritty with dust. \"And he’s made me come and get it for him? Why couldn’t he come and get it himself?\" \"Get it himself?\" shrieked Bellatrix, over a cackle of mad laughter. \"The Dark Lord, walk into the Ministry of Magic, when they are so sweetly ignoring his return? The Dark Lord, reveal himself to the Aurors, when at the moment they are wasting their time on my dear cousin?\" \"So, he’s got you doing his dirty work for him, has he?\" said Harry. \"Like he tried to get Sturgis to steal it - and Bode?\" \"Very good, Potter, very good...\" said Malfoy slowly. \"But the Dark Lord knows you are not unintell--\" \"NOW!\" yelled Harry. Five different voices behind him bellowed, \"REDUCTO!\" Five curses flew in five different directions and the shelves opposite them exploded as they hit; the towering structure swayed as a hundred glass spheres burst apart, pearly-white figures unfurled into the air and floated there, their voices echoing from who knew what long-dead past amid the torrent of crashing glass and splintered wood now raining down upon the floor - \"RUN!\" Harry yelled, as the shelves swayed precariously and more glass spheres began to fall from above. He seized a handful of Hermione’s robes and dragged her forwards, holding one arm over his head as chunks of shelf and shards of glass thundered down upon them. A Death Eater lunged forwards through the cloud of dust and Harry elbowed him hard in the masked face; they were all yelling, there were cries of pain, and thunderous crashes as the shelves collapsed upon themselves, weirdly echoing fragments of the Seers unleashed from their spheres - Harry found the way ahead clear and saw Ron, Ginny and Luna sprint past him, their arms over their heads; something heavy struck him on the side of the face but he merely ducked his head and sprinted onwards; a hand caught him by the shoulder; he heard Hermione shout, \"Stupefy!\" The hand released him at once - They were at the end of row ninety-seven; Harry turned right and began to sprint in earnest; he could hear footsteps right behind him and Hermione’s voice urging Neville on; straight ahead, the door through which they had come was ajar; Harry could see the glittering light of the bell jar; he pelted through the doorway, the prophecy still clutched tight and safe in his hand, and waited for the others to hurtle over the threshold before slamming the door behind them - \"Colloportus!\" gasped Hermione and the door sealed itself with an odd squelching noise. \"Where - where are the others?\" gasped Harry. He had thought Ron, Luna and Ginny were ahead of them, that they would be waiting in this room, but there was nobody there. \"They must have gone the wrong way!\" whispered Hermione, terror in her face. \"Listen!\" whispered Neville. Footsteps and shouts echoed from behind the door they had just sealed; Harry put his ear close to the door to listen and heard Lucius Malfoy roar, \"Leave Nott, leave him, I say -- his injuries will be nothing to the Dark Lord compared to losing that prophecy. Jugson, come back here, we need to organize! We’ll split into pairs and search, and don’t forget, be gentle with Potter until we’ve got the prophecy, you can kill the others if necessary - Bellatrix, Rodolphus, you take the left; Crabbe, Rabastan, go right -Jugson, Dolohov, the door straight ahead - Macnair and Avery, through here - Rookwood, over there - Mulciber, come with me!\" \"What do we do?\" Hermione asked Harry, trembling from head to foot. \"Well, we don’t stand here waiting for them to find us, for a start,\" said Harry. \"Let’s get away from this door.\" They ran as quietly as they could, past the shimmering bell jar where the tiny egg was hatching and unhatching, towards the exit into the circular hallway at the far end of the room. They were almost there when Harry heard something large and heavy collide with the door Hermione had charmed shut. \"Stand aside!\" said a rough voice. \"Alahomora!\" As the door flew open, Harry, Hermione and Neville dived under desks. They could see the bottom of the two Death Eaters’ robes drawing nearer, their feet moving rapidly. \"They might’ve run straight through to the hall,\" said the rough voice. \"Check under the desks,\" said another. Harry saw the knees of the Death Eaters bend; poking his wand out from under the desk, he shouted, \"STUPEFY!\" A jet of red light hit the nearest Death Eater; he fell backwards into a grandfather clock and knocked it over; the second Death Eater, however, had leapt aside to avoid Harry’s spell and was pointing his own wand at Hermione, who was crawling out from under the desk to get a better aim. \"Avada - Harry launched himself across the floor and grabbed the Death Eater around the knees, causing him to topple and his aim to go awry. Neville overturned a desk in his anxiety to help; and pointing his wand wildly at the struggling pair, he cried: \"EXPELLIARMUS!\" Both Harry’s and the Death Eater’s wands flew out of their hands and soared back towards the entrance to the Hall of Prophecy; both scrambled to their feet and charged after them, the Death Eater in front, Harry hot on his heels, and Neville bringing up the rear, plainly horrorstruck by what he had done. \"Get out of the way, Harry!\" yelled Neville, clearly determined to repair the damage. Harry flung himself sideways as Neville took aim again and shouted: \"STUPEFY!\" The jet of red light had flown right over the Death Eater’s shoulder and hit a glass-fronted cabinet on the wall full of variously shaped hour-glasses; the cabinet fell to the floor and burst apart, glass flying everywhere, sprang back up on to the wall, fully mended, then fell down again, and shattered - The Death Eater had snatched up his wand, which lay on the floor beside the glittering bell jar. Harry ducked down behind another desk as the man turned; his mask had slipped so that he couldn’t see. He ripped it off with his free hand and shouted: \"STUP--\" \"STUPEFY!\" screamed Hermione, who had just caught up with them. The jet of red light hit the Death Eater in the middle of his chest: he froze, his arm still raised, his wand fell to the floor with a clatter and he collapsed backwards towards the bell jar. Harry expected to hear a dunk, for the man to hit solid glass and slide off the jar on to the floor, but instead, his head sank through the surface of the bell jar as though it were nothing but a soap bubble and he came to rest, sprawled on his back on the table, with his head lying inside the jar full of glittering wind. \"Accio wand!\" cried Hermione. Harry’s wand flew from a dark corner into her hand and she threw it to him. \"Thanks,\" he said. \"Right, let’s get out of --\" \"Look out!\" said Neville, horrified. He was staring at the Death Eater’s head in the bell jar. All three of them raised their wands again, but none of them struck: they were all gazing, openmouthed, appalled, at what was happening to the man’s head. It was shrinking very fast, growing balder and balder, the black hair and stubble retracting into his skull; his cheeks becoming smooth, his skull round and covered with a peachlike fuzz... A baby’s head now sat grotesquely on top of the thick, muscled neck of the Death Eater as he struggled to get up again; but even as they watched, their mouths open, the head began to swell to its previous proportions again; thick black hair was sprouting from the pate and chin... \"It’s Time,\" said Hermione in an awestruck voice. \"Time...\" The Death Eater shook his ugly head again, trying to clear it, but before he could pull himself together it began to shrink back to babyhood once more... There was a shout from a room nearby, then a crash and a scream. \"RON?\" Harry yelled, turning quickly from the monstrous transformation taking place before them. \"GINNY? LUNA?\" \"Harry!\" Hermione screamed. The Death Eater had pulled his head out of the bell jar. His appearance was utterly bizarre, his tiny baby’s head bawling loudly while his thick arms flailed dangerously in all directions, narrowly missing Harry, who had ducked. Harry raised his wand but to his amazement Hermione seized his arm. \"You can’t hurt a baby!\" There was no time to argue the point; Harry could hear more footsteps growing louder from the Hall of Prophecy and knew, too late, that he ought not to have shouted and given away their position. \"Come on!\" he said, and leaving the ugly baby-headed Death Eater staggering behind them they took off for the door that stood open at the other end of the room, leading back into the black hallway. They had run halfway towards it when Harry saw through the open door two more Death Eaters running across the black room towards them; veering left, he burst instead into a small, dark, cluttered office and slammed the door behind them. \"Collo--\" began Hermione, but before she could complete the spell the door had burst open and the two Death Eaters had come hurtling inside. With a cry of triumph, both yelled: \"IMPEDIMENTA!\" Harry, Hermione and Neville were all knocked backwards off their feet; Neville was thrown over the desk and disappeared from view; Hermione smashed into a bookcase and was promptly deluged in a cascade of heavy books; the back of Harry’s head slammed into the stone wall behind him, tiny lights burst in front of his eyes and for a moment he was too dizzy and bewildered to react. \"WE’VE GOT HIM!\" yelled the Death Eater nearest Harry. \"IN AN OFFICE OFF--\" \"Silencio!\" cried Hermione and the man’s voice was extinguished. He continued to mouth through the hole in his mask, but no sound came out. He was thrust aside by his fellow Death Eater. \"Petrificus Totalus!\" shouted Harry, as the second Death Eater raised his wand. His arms and legs snapped together and he fell forwards, face down on to the rug at Harry’s feet, stiff as a board and unable to move. \"Well done, Ha--\" But the Death Eater Hermione had just struck dumb made a sudden slashing movement with his wand; a streak of what looked like purple flame passed right across Hermione’s chest. She gave a tiny \"Oh!\" as though of surprise and crumpled on to the floor, where she lay motionless. \"HERMIONE!\" Harry fell to his knees beside her as Neville crawled rapidly towards her from under the desk, his wand held up in front of him. The Death Eater kicked out hard at Neville’s head as he emerged - his foot broke Neville’s wand in two and connected with his face. Neville gave a howl of pain and recoiled, clutching his mouth and nose. Harry twisted around, his own wand held high, and saw that the Death Eater had ripped off his mask and was pointing his wand directly at Harry, who recognized the long, pale, twisted face from the Daily Prophet: Antonin Dolohov, the wizard who had murdered the Prewetts. Dolohov grinned. With his free hand, he pointed from the prophecy still clutched in Harrys hand, to himself, then at Hermione. Though he could no longer speak, his meaning could not have been clearer. Give me the prophecy, or you get the same as her... \"Like you won’t kill us all anyway, the moment I hand it over!\" said Harry. A whine of panic inside his head was preventing him thinking properly: he had one hand on Hermione’s shoulder, which was still warm, yet did not dare look at her properly. Don’t let her be dead, don’t let her be dead, it’s my fault if she’s dead... \"Whaddever you do, Harry,\" said Neville fiercely from under the desk, lowering his hands to show a clearly broken nose and blood pouring down his mouth and chin, \"don’d gib it to him!\" Then there was a crash outside the door and Dolohov looked over his shoulder - the baby-headed Death Eater had appeared in the doorway, his head bawling, his great fists still flailing uncontrollably at everything around him. Harry seized his chance: \"PETRIFICUS TOTALUS!\" The spell hit Dolohov before he could block it and he toppled forwards across his comrade, both of them rigid as boards and unable to move an inch. \"Hermione,\" Harry said at once, shaking her as the baby-headed Death Eater blundered out of sight again. \"Hermione, wake up...\" \"Whad did he do to her?\" said Neville, crawling out from under the desk to kneel at her other side, blood streaming from his rapidly swelling nose. \"I dunno...\" Neville groped for Hermione’s wrist. \"Dat’s a pulse, Harry, I’b sure id is.\" Such a powerful wave of relief swept through Harry that for a moment he felt light-headed. \"She’s alive?\" \"Yeah, I dink so.\" There was a pause in which Harry listened hard for the sound of more footsteps, but all he could hear were the whimpers and blunderings of the baby-headed Death Eater in the next room. \"Neville, we’re not far from the exit,\" Harry whispered, \"we’re right next to that circular room... if we can just get you across it and find the right door before any more Death Eaters come, I’ll bet you can get Hermione up the corridor and into the lift... then you could find someone... raise the alarm...\" \"And whad are you going do do?\" said Neville, mopping his bleeding nose with his sleeve and frowning at Harry. \"I’ve got to find the others,\" said Harry. \"Well, I’b going do find dem wid you,\" said Neville firmly. \"But Hermione --\" \"We’ll dake her wid us,\" said Neville firmly. \"I’ll carry her -- you’re bedder at fighding dem dan I ab -\" He stood up and seized one of Hermione’s arms, glaring at Harry, who hesitated, then grabbed the other and helped hoist Hermione’s limp form over Neville’s shoulders. \"Wait,\" said Harry, snatching up Hermione’s wand from the floor and shoving it into Neville’s hand, \"you’d better take this.\" Neville kicked aside the broken fragments of his own wand as they walked slowly towards the door. \"My gran’s going do kill be,\" said Neville thickly, blood spattering from his nose as he spoke, \"dat was by dad’s old wand.\" Harry stuck his head out of the door and looked around cautiously. The baby-headed Death Eater was screaming and banging into things, toppling grandfather clocks and overturning desks, bawling and confused, while the glass-fronted cabinet that Harry now suspected had contained Time-Turners continued to fall, shatter and repair itself on the wall behind them. \"He’s never going to notice us,\" he whispered. \"C’mon... keep close behind me...\" They crept out of the office and back towards the door into the black hallway, which now seemed completely deserted. They walked a few steps forwards, Neville tottering slightly due to Hermione’s weight; the door of the Time Room swung shut behind them and the walls began to rotate once more. The recent blow on the back of Harrys head seemed to have unsteadied him; he narrowed his eyes, swaying slightly, until the walls stopped moving again. With a sinking heart, Harry saw that Hermione’s fiery crosses had faded from the doors. \"So which way d’you reck--?\" But before they could make a decision as to which way to try, a door to their right sprang open and three people fell out of it. \"Ron!\" croaked Harry, dashing towards them. \"Ginny - are you all -?\" \"Harry,\" said Ron, giggling weakly, lurching forwards, seizing the front of Harry’s robes and gazing at him with unfocused eyes, \"there you are... ha ha ha... you look funny, Harry... you’re all messed up...\" Ron’s face was very white and something dark was trickling from the corner of his mouth. Next moment his knees had given way, but he still clutched the front of Harry’s robes, so that Harry was pulled into a kind of bow. \"Ginny?\" Harry said fearfully. \"What happened?\" But Ginny shook her head and slid down the wall into a sitting position, panting and holding her ankle. \"I think her ankle’s broken, I heard something crack,\" whispered Luna, who was bending over her and who alone seemed to be unhurt. \"Four of them chased us into a dark room full of planets; it was a very odd place, some of the time we were just floating in the dark -\" \"Harry, we saw Uranus up close!\" said Ron, still giggling feebly. \"Get it, Harry? We saw Uranus - ha ha ha -\" A bubble of blood grew at the corner of Ron’s mouth and burst. \"- anyway, one of them grabbed Ginny’s foot, I used the Reductor Curse and blew up Pluto in his face, but...\" Luna gestured hopelessly at Ginny, who was breathing in a very shallow way, her eyes still closed. \"And what about Ron?\" said Harry fearfully, as Ron continued to giggle, still hanging off the front of Harry’s robes. \"I don’t know what they hit him with,\" said Luna sadly, \"but he’s gone a bit funny, I could hardly get him along at all.\" \"Harry,\" said Ron, pulling Harry’s ear down to his mouth and still giggling weakly, \"you know who this girl is, Harry? She’s Loony... Loony Lovegood... ha ha ha \" \"We’ve got to get out of here,\" said Harry firmly. \"Luna, can you help Ginny?\" \"Yes,\" said Luna, sticking her wand behind her ear for safekeeping, then putting an arm around Ginnys waist and pulling her up. \"It’s only my ankle, I can do it myself!\" said Ginny impatiently, but next moment she had collapsed sideways and grabbed Luna for support. Harry pulled Ron’s arm over his shoulder just as, so many months ago, he had pulled Dudley’s. He looked around: they had a one in twelve chance of getting the exit right first time - He heaved Ron towards a door; they were within a few feet of it when another door across the hall burst open and three Death Eaters sped in, led by Bellatrix Lestrange. \"There they are!\" she shrieked. Stunning Spells shot across the room: Harry smashed his way through the door ahead, flung Ron unceremoniously from him and ducked back to help Neville in with Hermione: they were all over the threshold just in time to slam the door against Bellatrix. \"Colloportus!\" shouted Harry, and he heard three bodies slam into the door on the other side. \"It doesn’t matter!\" said a man’s voice. \"There are other ways in - WE’VE GOT THEM, THEY’RE HERE!\" Harry span around; they were back in the Brain Room and, sure enough, there were doors all around the walls. He could hear footsteps in the hall behind them as more Death Eaters came running to join the first. \"Luna - Neville - help me!\" The three of them tore around the room, sealing the doors as they went; Harry crashed into a table and rolled over the top of it in his haste to reach the next door: \"Colloportus!\" There were footsteps running along behind the doors, every now and then another heavy body would launch itself against one, so it creaked and shuddered; Luna and Neville were bewitching the doors along the opposite wall - then, as Harry reached the very top of the room, he heard Luna cry: \"Collo--aaaaaaaaargh...\" He turned in time to see her flying through the air; five Death Eaters were surging into the room through the door she had not reached in time; Luna hit a desk, slid over its surface and on to the floor on the other side where she lay sprawled, as still as Hermione. \"Get Potter!\" shrieked Bellatrix, and she ran at him; he dodged her and sprinted back up the room; he was safe as long as they thought they might hit the prophecy - \"Hey!\" said Ron, who had staggered to his feet and was now tottering drunkenly towards Harry, giggling. \"Hey Harry, there are brains in here, ha h a ha, isn’t that weird, Harry?\" \"Ron, get out of the way, get down -\" But Ron had already pointed his wand at the tank. \"Honest, Harry, they’re brains - look -Accio brain!\" The scene seemed momentarily frozen. Harry, Ginny and Neville and each of the Death Eaters turned in spite of themselves to watch the top of the tank as a brain burst from the green liquid like a leaping fish: for a moment it seemed suspended in midair, then it soared towards Ron, spinning as it came, and what looked like ribbons of moving images flew from it, unraveling like rolls of film- \"Ha ha ha, Harry, look at it -\" said Ron, watching it disgorge its gaudy innards, \"Harry come and touch it; bet it’s weird -\" \"RON, NO!\" Harry did not know what would happen if Ron touched the tentacles of thought now flying behind the brain, but he was sure it would not be anything good. He darted forwards but Ron had already caught the brain in his outstretched hands. The moment they made contact with his skin, the tentacles began wrapping themselves around Ron’s arms like ropes. \"Harry, look what’s happen-- No - no - I don’t like it - no, stop - stop -\" But the thin ribbons were spinning around Ron’s chest now; he tugged and tore at them as the brain was pulled tight against him like an octopus’s body. \"Diffindo!\" yelled Harry, trying to sever the feelers wrapping themselves tightly around Ron before his eyes, but they would not break. Ron fell over, still thrashing against his bonds. \"Harry, it’ll suffocate him!\" screamed Ginny, immobilized by her broken ankle on the floor - then a jet of red light flew from one of the Death Eater’s wands and hit her squarely in the face. She keeled over sideways and lay there unconscious. \"STUBEFY!\" shouted Neville, wheeling around and waving Hermione’s wand at the oncoming Death Eaters, \"STUBEFY, STUBEFY!\" But nothing happened. One of the Death Eaters shot their own Stunning Spell at Neville; it missed him by inches. Harry and Neville were now the only two left fighting the five Death Eaters, two of whom sent off streams of silver light like arrows which missed but left craters in the wall behind them. Harry ran for it as Bellatrix Lestrange raced right at him: holding the prophecy high above his head, he sprinted back up the room; all he could think of doing was to draw the Death Eaters away from the others. It seemed to have worked; they streaked after him, knocking chairs and tables flying but not daring to bewitch him in case they hurt the prophecy, and he dashed through the only door still open, the one through which the Death Eaters themselves had come; inwardly praying that Neville would stay with Ron and find some way of releasing him. He ran a few feet into the new room and felt the floor vanish - He was falling down steep stone step after steep stone step, bouncing on every tier until at last, with a crash that knocked all the breath out of his body, he landed flat on his back in the sunken pit where the stone archway stood on its dais. The whole room was ringing with the Death Eaters’ laughter: he looked up and saw the five who had been in the Brain Room descending towards him, while as many more emerged through other doorways and began leaping from bench to bench towards him. Harry got to his feet though his legs were trembling so badly they barely supported him: the prophecy was still miraculously unbroken in his left hand, his wand clutched tightly in his right. He backed away, looking around, trying to keep all the Death Eaters within his sight. The back of his legs hit something solid: he had reached the dais where the archway stood. He climbed backwards onto it. The Death Eaters all halted, gazing at him. Some were panting as hard as he was. One was bleeding badly; Dolohov, freed of the Body-Bind Curse, was leering, his wand pointing straight at Harrys face. \"Potter, your race is run,\" drawled Lucius Malfoy, pulling off his mask, \"now hand me the prophecy like a good boy.\" \"Let - let the others go, and I’ll give it to you!\" said Harry desperately. A few of the Death Eaters laughed. \"You are not in a position to bargain, Potter,\" said Lucius Malfoy, his pale face flushed with pleasure. \"You see, there are ten of us and only one of you... or hasn’t Dumbledore ever taught you how to count?\" \"He’s dot alone!\" shouted a voice from above them. \"He’s still god be!\" Harry’s heart sank: Neville was scrambling down the stone benches towards them, Hermiones wand held fast in his trembling hand. \"Neville - no - go back to Ron -\" \"STUBEFY!\" Neville shouted again, pointing his wand at each Death Eater in turn. \"STUBEFY! STUBE--\" One of the largest Death Eaters seized Neville from behind, pinioning his arms to his sides. He struggled and kicked; several of the Death Eaters laughed. \"It’s Longbottom, isn’t it\" sneered Lucius Malfoy. \"Well, your grandmother is used to losing family members to our cause... your death will not come as a great shock.\" \"Longbottom?\" repeated Bellatrix, and a truly evil smile lit her gaunt face. \"Why, I have had the pleasure of meeting your parents, boy,\" \"I DOE YOU HAB!\" roared Neville, and he fought so hard against his captors encircling grip that the Death Eater shouted, \"Someone Stun him!\" \"No, no, no,\" said Bellatrix. She looked transported, alive with excitement as she glanced at Harry, then back at Neville. \"No, let’s see how long Longbottom lasts before he cracks like his parents... unless Potter wants to give us the prophecy.\" \"DON’D GIB ID DO DEM!\" roared Neville, who seemed beside himself, kicking and writhing as Bellatrix drew nearer to him and his captor, her wand raised. \"DON’D GIB ID DO DEM, HARRY!\" Bellatrix raised her wand. \"Crucio!\" Neville screamed, his legs drawn up to his chest so that the Death Eater holding him was momentarily holding him off the ground. The Death Eater dropped him and he fell to the floor, twitching and screaming in agony. \"That was just a taster!\" said Bellatrix, raising her wand so that Neville’s screams stopped and he lay sobbing at her feet. She turned and gazed up at Harry. \"Now, Potter, either give us the prophecy, or watch your little friend die the hard way!\" Harry did not have to think; there was no choice. The prophecy was hot with the heat of his clutching hand as he held it out. Malfoy jumped forwards to take it. Then, high above them, two more doors burst open and five more people sprinted into the room: Sirius, Lupin, Moody, Tonks and Kingsley. Malfoy turned, and raised his wand, but Tonks had already sent a Stunning Spell right at him. Harry did not wait to see whether it had made contact, but dived off the dais out of the way. The Death Eaters were completely distracted by the appearance of the members of the Order, who were now raining spells down upon them as they jumped from step to step towards the sunken floor. Through the darting bodies, the flashes of light, Harry could see Neville crawling along. He dodged another jet of red light and flung himself flat on the ground to reach Neville. \"Are you okay?\" he yelled, as another spell soared inches over their heads. \"Yes,\" said Neville, trying to pull himself up. \"And Ron?\" \"I dink he’s all righd - he was still fighding de brain when I lefd -\" The stone floor between them exploded as a spell hit it, leaving a crater right where Neville’s hand had been only seconds before; both scrambled away from the spot, then a thick arm came out of nowhere, seized Harry around the neck and pulled him upright, so that his toes were barely touching the floor. \"Give it to me,\" growled a voice in his ear, \"give me the prophecy -\" The man was pressing so tightly on Harry’s windpipe that he could not breathe. Through watering eyes he saw Sirius dueling with a Death Eater some ten feet away; Kingsley was fighting two at once; Tonks, still halfway up the tiered seats, was firing spells down at Bellatrix - nobody seemed to realize that Harry was dying. He turned his wand backwards towards the man’s side, but had no breath to utter an incantation, and the man’s free hand was groping towards the hand in which Harry was grasping the prophecy - \"AARGH!\" Neville had come lunging out of nowhere; unable to articulate a spell, he had jabbed Hermione’s wand hard into the eyehole of the Death Eaters mask. The man relinquished Harry at once with a howl of pain. Harry whirled around to face him and gasped: \"STUPEFY!\" The Death Eater keeled over backwards and his mask slipped off: it was Macnair, Buckbeak’s would-be killer, one of his eyes now swollen and bloodshot. \"Thanks!\" Harry said to Neville, pulling him aside as Sirius and his Death Eater lurched past, dueling so fiercely that their wands were blurs; then Harry’s foot made contact with something round and hard and he slipped. For a moment he thought he had dropped the prophecy, but then he saw Moody’s magical eye spinning away across the floor. Its owner was lying on his side, bleeding from the head, and his attacker was now bearing down upon Harry and Neville: Dolohov, his long pale face twisted with glee. \"Tarantallegra!\" he shouted, his wand pointing at Neville, whose legs went immediately into a kind of frenzied tap-dance, unbalancing him and causing him to fall to the floor again. \"Now, Potter -\" He made the same slashing movement with his wand that he had used on Hermione just as Harry yelled, \"Protego!\" Harry felt something streak across his face like a blunt knife; the force of it knocked him sideways and he fell over Neville’s jerking legs, but the Shield Charm had stopped the worst of the spell. Dolohov raised his wand again. \"Accio proph--\" Sirius had hurtled out of nowhere, rammed Dolohov with his shoulder and sent him flying out of the way. The prophecy had again flown to the tips of Harry’s fingers but he had managed to cling on to it. Now Sirius and Dolohov were dueling, their wands flashing like swords, sparks flying from their wand-tips - Dolohov drew back his wand to make the same slashing movement he had used on Harry and Hermione. Springing up, Harry yelled, \"Petrificus Totalus!\" Once again, Dolohov’s arms and legs snapped together and he keeled over backwards, landing with a crash on his back. \"Nice one!\" shouted Sirius, forcing Harry’s head down as a pair of Stunning Spells flew towards them. \"Now I want you to get out of-\" They both ducked again; a jet of green light had narrowly missed Sirius. Across the room Harry saw Tonks fall from halfway up the stone steps, her limp form toppling from stone seat to stone seat and Bellatrix, triumphant, running back towards the fray. \"Harry, take the prophecy, grab Neville and run!\" Sirius yelled, dashing to meet Bellatrix. Harry did not see what happened next: Kingsley swayed across his field of vision, battling with the pockmarked and no longer masked Rookwood; another jet of green light flew over Harry’s head as he launched himself towards Neville - \"Can you stand?\" he bellowed in Neville’s ear, as Neville’s legs jerked and twitched uncontrollably. \"Put your arm round my neck -\" Neville did so - Harry heaved -- Neville’s legs were still flying in every direction, they would not support him, and then, out of nowhere, a man lunged at them: both fell backwards, Neville’s legs waving wildly like an overturned beetle’s, Harry with his left arm held up in the air to try to save the small glass ball from being smashed. \"The prophecy, give me the prophecy, Potter!\" snarled Lucius Malfoy’s voice in his ear, and Harry felt the tip of Malfoy’s wand pressing hard between his ribs. \"No - get - off - me... Neville - catch it!\" Harry flung the prophecy across the floor, Neville spun himself around on his back and scooped the ball to his chest. Malfoy pointed the wand instead at Neville, but Harry jabbed his own wand back over his shoulder and yelled, \"Impedimenta!\" Malfoy was blasted off his back. As Harry scrambled up again he looked around and saw Malfoy smash into the dais on which Sirius and Bellatrix were now dueling. Malfoy aimed his wand at Harry and Neville again, but before he could draw breath to strike, Lupin had jumped between them. \"Harry, round up the others and GO!\" Harry seized Neville by the shoulder of his robes and lifted him bodily on to the first tier of stone steps; Neville’s legs twitched and jerked and would not support his weight; Harry heaved again with all the strength he possessed and they climbed another step - A spell hit the stone bench at Harrys heel; it crumbled away and he fell back to the step below. Neville sank to the ground, his legs still jerking and thrashing, and he thrust the prophecy into his pocket. \"Come on!\" said Harry desperately, hauling at Neville’s robes. \"Just try and push with your legs\" He gave another stupendous heave and Neville’s robes tore all along the left seam - the small spun-glass ball dropped from his pocket and, before either of them could catch it, one of Neville’s floundering feet kicked it: it flew some ten feet to their right and smashed on the step beneath them. As both of them stared at the place where it had broken, appalled at what had happened, a pearly-white figure with hugely magnified eyes rose into the air, unnoticed by any but them. Harry could see its mouth moving, but in all the crashes and screams and yells surrounding them, not one word of the prophecy could he hear. The figure stopped speaking and dissolved into nothingness. \"Harry, I’b sorry!\" cried Neville, his face anguished as his legs continued to flounder. \"I’b so sorry, Harry, I didn’d bean do -\" \"It doesn’t matter!\" Harry shouted. \"Just try and stand, let’s get out of -\" \"Dubbledore!\" said Neville, his sweaty face suddenly transported, staring over Harry’s shoulder. \"What?\" \"DUBBLEDORE!\" Harry turned to look where Neville was staring. Directly above them, framed in the doorway from the Brain Room, stood Albus Dumbledore, his wand aloft, his face white and furious. Harry felt a kind of electric charge surge through every particle of his body - they were saved. Dumbledore sped down the steps past Neville and Harry, who had no more thoughts of leaving. Dumbledore was already at the foot of the steps when the Death Eaters nearest realized he was there and yelled to the others. One of the Death Eaters ran for it, scrabbling like a monkey up the stone steps opposite. Dumbledore’s spell pulled him back as easily and effortlessly as though he had hooked him with an invisible line - Only one pair was still battling, apparently unaware of the new arrival. Harry saw Sirius duck Bellatrix’s jet of red light: he was laughing at her. \"Come on, you can do better than that!\" he yelled, his voice echoing around the cavernous room. The second jet of light hit him squarely on the chest. The laughter had not quite died from his face, but his eyes widened in shock. Harry released Neville, though he was unaware of doing so. He was jumping down the steps again, pulling out his wand, as Dumbledore, too, turned towards the dais. It seemed to take Sirius an age to fall: his body curved in a graceful arc as he sank backwards through the ragged veil hanging from the arch. Harry saw the look of mingled fear and surprise on his godfather’s wasted, once-handsome face as he fell through the ancient doorway and disappeared behind the veil, which fluttered for a moment as though in a high wind, then fell back into place. Harry heard Bellatrix Lestrange’s triumphant scream, but knew it meant nothing - Sirius had only just fallen through the archway, he would reappear from the other side any second... But Sirius did not reappear. \"SIRIUS!\" Harry yelled. \"SIRIUS!\" He had reached the floor, his breath coming in searing gasps. Sirius must be just behind the curtain, he, Harry, would pull him back out... But as he reached the ground and sprinted towards the dais, Lupin grabbed Harry around the chest, holding him back. \"There’s nothing you can do, Harry -\" \"Get him, save him, he’s only just gone through!\" \"- it’s too late, Harry.\" \"We can still reach him -\" Harry struggled hard and viciously, but Lupin would not let go... \"There’s nothing you can do, Harry... nothing... he’s gone.\" \n",

            " THIRTYTHREE  THE DEATH EATERS Voldemort looked away from Harry and began examining his own body. His hands were like large, pale spiders; his long white fingers caressed his own chest, his arms, his face; the red eyes, whose pupils were slits, like a cats, gleamed still more brightly through the darkness. He held up his hands and flexed the fingers, his expression rapt and exultant. He took not the slightest notice of Wormtail, who lay twitching and bleeding on the ground, nor of the great snake, which had slithered back into sight and was circling Harry again, hissing. Voldemort slipped one of those unnaturally longfingered hands into a deep pocket and drew out a wand. He caressed it gently too; and then he raised it, and pointed it at Wormtail, who was lifted off the ground and thrown against the headstone where Harry was tied; he fell to the foot of it and lay there, crumpled up and crying. Voldemort turned his scarlet eyes upon Harry, laughing a high, cold, mirthless laugh. Wormtail's robes were shining with blood now; he had wrapped the stump of his arm in them. \"My Lord . . .\" he choked, \"my Lord . . . you promised . . . you did promise ...\" \"Hold out your arm,\" said Voldemort lazily. \"Oh Master . . . thank you, Master ...\" He extended the bleeding stump, but Voldemort laughed again. \"The other arm, Wormtail.\" \"Master, please . . .please ...\" Voldemort bent down and pulled out Wormtail's left arm; he forced the sleeve of Wormtail's robes up past his elbow, and Harry saw something upon the skin there, something like a vivid red tattoo  a skull with a snake protruding from its mouth  the image that had appeared in the sky at the Quidditch World Cup: the Dark Mark. Voldemort examined it carefully, ignoring Wormtail's uncontrollable weeping. \"It is back,\" he said softly, \"they will all have noticed it... and now, we shall see ... now we shall know ...\" He pressed his long white forefinger to the brand on Wormtail's arm. The scar on Harry s forehead seared with a sharp pain again, and Wormtail let out a fresh howl; Voldemort removed his fingers from Wormtail's mark, and Harry saw that it had turned jet black. A look of cruel satisfaction on his face, Voldemort straightened up, threw back his head, and stared around at the dark graveyard. \"How many will be brave enough to return when they feel it?\" he whispered, his gleaming red eyes fixed upon the stars. \"And how many will be foolish enough to stay away?\" He began to pace up and down before Harry and Wormtail, eyes sweeping the graveyard all the while. After a minute or so, he looked down at Harry again, a cruel smile twisting his snakelike face. \"You stand, Harry Potter, upon the remains of my late father,\" he hissed softly. \"A Muggle and a fool. . . very like your dear mother. But they both had their uses, did they not? Your mother died to defend you as a child . . . and I killed my father, and see how useful he has proved himself, in death. ...\" Voldemort laughed again. Up and down he paced, looking all around him as he walked, and the snake continued to circle in the grass. \"You see that house upon the hillside, Potter? My father lived there. My mother, a witch who lived here in this village, fell in love with him. But he abandoned her when she told him what she was. ... He didn't like magic, my father . . . \"He left her and returned to his Muggle parents before I was even born. Potter, and she died giving birth to me, leaving me to be raised in a Muggle orphanage . . . but I vowed to find him ... I revenged myself upon him, that fool who gave me his name . . . Tom Riddle. . . .\" Still he paced, his red eyes darting from grave to grave. \"Listen to me, reliving family history . . .\" he said quietly, \"why, I am growing quite sentimental. . . . But look, Harry! My true family returns. . . .\" The air was suddenly full of the swishing of cloaks. Between graves, behind the yew tree, in every shadowy space, wizards were Apparating. All of them were hooded and masked. And one by one they moved forward . . . slowly, cautiously, as though they could hardly believe their eyes Voldemort stood in silence, waiting for them. Then one of the Death Eaters fell to his knees, crawled toward Voldemort and kissed the hem of his black robes. Master . . . Master \" he murmured. The Death Eaters behind him did the same; each of them approaching Voldemort on his knees and kissing his robes, before backing away and standing up, forming a silent circle, which enclosed Tom Riddle s grave, Harry, Voldemort, and the sobbing and twitching heap that was Wormtail. Yet they left gaps in the circle, as though waiting for more people. Voldemort, however, did not seem to expect more. He looked around at the hooded faces, and though there was no wind rustling seemed to run around the circle, as though it had shivered. \"Welcome, Death Eaters,\" said Voldemort quietly. \"Thirteen years. . . thirteen years since last we met. Yet you answer my call as though it were yesterday, we are still united under the Dark Mark, then! Or are we?\" He put back his terrible face and sniffed, his slitlike nostrils widening. \"I smell guilt,\" he said. \"There is a stench or guilt upon the air. A second shiver ran around the circle, as though each member of it longed, but did not dare to step back from him. \"I see you all, whole and healthy, with your powers intact  such prompt appearances! and I ask myself . . . why did this band of wizards never come to the aid of their master, to whom they swore eternal loyalty?\" No one spoke. No one moved except Wormtail, who was upon the ground, still sobbing over his bleeding arm. \"And I answer myself,\" whispered Voldemort, \"they must have believed me broken, they thought I was gone. They slipped back among my enemies, and they pleaded innocence, and ignorance, and bewitchment. . . . \"And then I ask myself, but how could they have believed I would not rise again! They, who knew the steps I took, long ago, to guard myself against mortal death! They, who had seen proofs of the immensity of my power in the times when I was mightier than any wizard living! \"And I answer myself, perhaps they believed a still greater power could exist, one that could vanquish even Lord Voldemort. . . perhaps they now pay allegiance to another . . . perhaps that champion of commoners, of Mudbloods and Muggles, Albus Dumbledore?\" At the mention of Dumbledore's name, the members of the circle stirred, and some muttered and shook their heads. Voldemort ignored them. \"It is a disappointment to me ... I confess myself disappointed. . . .\" One of the men suddenly flung himself forward, breaking the circle. Trembling from head to foot, he collapsed at Voldemort's feet. \"Master!\" he shrieked, \"Master, forgive me! Forgive us all!\" Voldemort began to laugh. He raised his wand. \"Crucio!\" The Death Eater on the ground writhed and shrieked; Harry was sure the sound must carry to the houses around. . . . Let the police come, he thought desperately . . . anyone . .. anything. . . Voldemort raised his wand. The tortured Death Eater lay flat upon the ground, gasping. \"Get up, Avery,\" said Voldemort softly. \"Stand up. You ask for forgiveness? I do not forgive. I do not forget. Thirteen long years ... I want thirteen years' repayment before I forgive you. Wormtail here has paid some of his debt already, have you not, Wormtail?\" He looked down at Wormtail, who continued to sob. \"You returned to me, not out of loyalty, but out of fear of your old friends. You deserve this pain, Wormtail. You know that, don't you?\" \"Yes, Master,\" moaned Wormtail, \"please. Master . . . please ...\" \"Yet you helped return me to my body,\" said Voldemort coolly, watching Wormtail sob on the ground. \"Worthless and traitorous as you are, you helped me ... and Lord Voldemort rewards his helpers... .\" Voldemort raised his wand again and whirled it through the air. A streak of what looked like molten silver hung shining in the wand's wake. Momentarily shapeless, it writhed and then formed itself into a gleaming replica of a human hand, bright as moonlight, which soared downward and fixed itself upon Wormtails bleeding wrist. Wormtail's sobbing stopped abruptly. His breathing harsh and ragged, he raised his head and stared in disbelief at the silver hand, now attached seamlessly to his arm, as though he were wearing a dazzling glove. He flexed the shining fingers, then, trembling, picked up a small twig on the ground and crushed it into powder. \"My Lord,\" he whispered. \"Master ... it is beautiful. . . thank you... thank you. ...\" He scrambled forward on his knees and kissed the hem of Voldemort's robes. \"May your loyalty never waver again, Wormtail,\" said Voldemort. \"No, my Lord . . . never, my Lord . . .\" Wormtail stood up and took his place in the circle, staring at his powerful new hand, his face still shining with tears. Voldemort now approached the man on Wormtail's right. \"Lucius, my slippery friend,\" he whispered, halting before him. \"I am told that you have not renounced the old ways, though to the world you present a respectable face. You are still ready to take the lead in a spot of Muggletorture, I believe? Yet you never tried to find me, Lucius. . . . Your exploits at the Quidditch World Cup were fun, I daresay. . . but might not your energies have been better directed toward finding and aiding your master?\" \"My Lord, I was constantly on the alert,\" came Lucius Malfoy's voice swiftly from beneath the hood. \"Had there been any sign from you, any whisper of your whereabouts, I would have been at your side immediately, nothing could have prevented me \" \"And yet you ran from my Mark, when a faithful Death Eater sent it into the sky last summer?\" said Voldemort lazily, and Mr. Malfoy stopped talking abruptly. \"Yes, I know all about that, Lucius. . . . You have disappointed me. ... I expect more faithful service in the future.\" \"Of course, my Lord, of course. . . . You are merciful, thank you. ...\" Voldemort moved on, and stopped, staring at the space  large enough for two people  that separated Malfoy and the next man. \"The Lestranges should stand here,\" said Voldemort quietly. \"But they are entombed in Azkaban. They were faithful. They went to Azkaban rather than renounce me. . . . When Azkaban is broken open, the Lestranges will be honored beyond their dreams. The dementors will join us ... they are our natural allies ... we will recall the banished giants ... I shall have all my devoted servants returned to me, and an army of creatures whom all fear. ...\" He walked on. Some of the Death Eaters he passed in silence, but he paused before others and spoke to them. \"Macnair . . . destroying dangerous beasts for the Ministry of Magic now, Wormtail tells me? You shall have better victims than that soon, Macnair. Lord Voldemort will provide. ...\" \"Thank you, Master . . . thank you,\" murmured Macnair. \"And here\"  Voldemort moved on to the two largest hooded figures  \"we have Crabbe . . . you will do better this time, will you not, Crabbe? And you, Goyle?\" They bowed clumsily, muttering dully. \"Yes, Master ...\" \"We will, Master....\" \"The same goes for you, Nott,\" said Voldemort quietly as he walked past a stooped figure in Mr. Goyles shadow. \"My Lord, I prostrate myself before you, I am your most faithful \" \"That will do,\" said Voldemort. He had reached the largest gap of all, and he stood surveying it with his blank, red eyes, as though he could see people standing there. \"And here we have six missing Death Eaters . . . three dead in my service. One, too cowardly to return ... he will pay. One, who I believe has left me forever ... he will be killed, of course . . . and one, who remains my most faithful servant, and who has already reentered my service.\" The Death Eaters stirred, and Harry saw their eyes dart sideways at one another through their masks. \"He is at Hogwarts, that faithful servant, and it was through his efforts that our young friend arrived here tonight. . . . \"Yes,\" said Voldemort, a grin curling his lipless mouth as the eyes of the circle flashed in Harry's direction. \"Harry Potter has kindly joined us for my rebirthing party. One might go so far as to call him my guest of honor.\" There was a silence. Then the Death Eater to the right of Wormtail stepped forward, and Lucius Malfoy's voice spoke from under the mask. \"Master, we crave to know ... we beg you to tell us ... how you have achieved this . . . this miracle . . . how you managed to return to us. .. .\" \"Ah, what a story it is, Lucius,\" said Voldemort. \"And it begins  and ends  with my young friend here.\" He walked lazily over to stand next to Harry, so that the eyes of the whole circle were upon the two of them. The snake continued to circle. \"You know, of course, that they have called this boy my downfall?\" Voldemort said softly, his red eyes upon Harry, whose scar began to burn so fiercely that he almost screamed in agony. \"You all know that on the night I lost my powers and my body, I tried to kill him. His mother died in the attempt to save him  and unwittingly provided him with a protection I admit I had not foreseen. ... I could not touch the boy.\" Voldemort raised one of his long white fingers and put it very close to Harry's cheek. \"His mother left upon him the traces other sacrifice. . . . This is old magic, I should have remembered it, I was foolish to overlook it... but no matter. I can touch him now.\" Harry felt the cold tip of the long white finger touch him, and thought his head would burst with the pain. Voldemort laughed softly in his ear, then took the finger away and continued addressing the Death Eaters. \"I miscalculated, my friends, I admit it. My curse was deflected by the woman's foolish sacrifice, and it rebounded upon myself. Aaah . . . pain beyond pain, my friends; nothing could have prepared me for it. I was ripped from my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost. . . but still, I was alive. What I was, even I do not know... I, who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality. You know my goal  to conquer death. And now, I was tested, and it appeared that one or more of my experiments had worked ... for I had not been killed, though the curse should have done it. Nevertheless, I was as powerless as the weakest creature alive, and without the means to help myself... for I had no body, and every spell that might have helped me required the use of a wand. . . . \"I remember only forcing myself, sleeplessly, endlessly, second by second, to exist. ... I settled in a faraway place, in a forest, and I waited. . . . Surely, one of my faithful Death Eaters would try and find me. . . one of them would come and perform the magic I could not, to restore me to a body . . , but I waited in vain. ...\" The shiver ran once more around the circle of listening Death Eaters. Voldemort let the silence spiral horribly before continuing. \"Only one power remained to me. I could possess the bodies of others. But I dared not go where other humans were plentiful, for I knew that the Aurors were still abroad and searching for me. I sometimes inhabited animals  snakes, of course, being my preference  but I was little better off inside them than as pure spirit, for their bodies were ill adapted to perform magic . . . and my possession of them shortened their lives; none of them lasted long. . . . \"Then . . . four years ago . . . the means for my return seemed assured. A wizard  young, foolish, and gullible  wandered across my path in the forest I had made my home. Oh, he seemed the very chance I had been dreaming of... for he was a teacher at Dumbledore's school... he was easy to bend to my will... he brought me back to this country, and after a while, I took possession of his body, to supervise him closely as he carried out my orders. But my plan failed. I did not manage to steal the Sorcerer's Stone. I was not to be assured immortal life. I was thwarted . . . thwarted, once again, by Harry Potter. ...\" Silence once more; nothing was stirring, not even the leaves on the yew tree. The Death Eaters were quite motionless, the glittering eyes in their masks fixed upon Voldemort, and upon Harry. \"The servant died when I left his body, and I was left as weak as ever I had been,\" Voldemort continued. \"I returned to my hiding place far away, and I will not pretend to you that I didn't then fear that I might never regain my powers. . . . Yes, that was perhaps my darkest hour... I could not hope that I would be sent another wizard to possess . . . and I had given up hope, now, that any of my Death Eaters cared what had become of me. ...\" One or two of the masked wizards in the circle moved uncomfortably, but Voldemort took no notice. \"And then, not even a year ago, when I had almost abandoned hope, it happened at last... a servant returned to me. Wormtail here, who had faked his own death to escape justice, was driven out of hiding by those he had once counted friends, and decided to return to his master. He sought me in the country where it had long been rumored I was hiding . . . helped, of course, by the rats he met along the way. Wormtail has a curious affinity with rats, do you not, Wormtail? His filthy little friends told him there was a place, deep in an Albanian forest, that they avoided, where small animals like themselves had met their deaths by a dark shadow that possessed them. . . . \"But his journey back to me was not smooth, was it, Wormtail? For, hungry one night, on the edge of the very forest where he had hoped to find me, he foolishly stopped at an inn for some food . . . and who should he meet there, but one Bertha Jorkins, a witch from the Ministry of Magic. \"Now see the way that fate favors Lord Voldemort. This might have been the end of Wormtail, and of my last hope for regeneration. But Wormtail  displaying a presence of mind I would never have expected from him  convinced Bertha Jorkins to accompany him on a nighttime stroll. He overpowered her ... he brought her to me. And Bertha Jorkins, who might have ruined all, proved instead to be a gift beyond my wildest dreams ... for  with a little persuasion  she became a veritable mine of information. \"She told me that the Triwizard Tournament would be played at Hogwarts this year. She told me that she knew of a faithful Death Eater who would be only too willing to help me, if I could only contact him. She told me many things. . . but the means I used to break the Memory Charm upon her were powerful, and when I had extracted all useful information from her, her mind and body were both damaged beyond repair. She had now served her purpose. I could not possess her. I disposed of her.\" Voldemort smiled his terrible smile, his red eyes blank and pitiless. \"Wormtail's body, of course, was ill adapted for possession, as all assumed him dead, and would attract far too much attention if noticed. However, he was the ablebodied servant I needed, and, poor wizard though he is, Wormtail was able to follow the instructions I gave him, which would return me to a rudimentary, weak body of my own, a body I would be able to inhabit while awaiting the essential ingredients for true rebirth ... a spell or two of my own invention ... a little help from my dear Nagini,\" Voldemorts red eyes fell upon the continually circling snake, \"a potion concocted from unicorn blood, and the snake venom Nagini provided ... I was soon returned to an almost human form, and strong enough to travel. \"There was no hope of stealing the Sorcerer's Stone anymore, for I knew that Dumbledore would have seen to it that it was destroyed. But I was willing to embrace mortal life again, before chasing immortality. I set my sights lower ... I would settle for my old body back again, and my old strength. \"I knew that to achieve this  it is an old piece of Dark Magic, the potion that revived me tonight  I would need three powerful ingredients. Well, one of them was already at hand, was it not, Wormtail? Flesh given by a servant. . . . \"My father's bone, naturally, meant that we would have to come here, where he was buried. But the blood of a foe ... Wormtail would have had me use any wizard, would you not, Wormtail? Any wizard who had hated me ... as so many of them still do. But I knew the one I must use, if I was to rise again, more powerful than I had been when I had fallen. I wanted Harry Potters blood. I wanted the blood of the one who had stripped me of power thirteen years ago . . . for the lingering protection his mother once gave him would then reside in my veins too. . \"But how to get at Harry Potter? For he has been better protected than I think even he knows, protected in ways devised by Dumbledore long ago, when it fell to him to arrange the boy's future. Dumbledore invoked an ancient magic, to ensure the boy's protection as long as he is in his relations' care. Not even I can touch him there. . . . Then, of course, there was the Quidditch World Cup. ... I thought his protection might be weaker there, away from his relations and Dumbledore, but I was not yet strong enough to attempt kidnap in the midst of a horde of Ministry wizards. And then, the boy would return to Hogwarts, where he is under the crooked nose of that Muggleloving fool from morning until night. So how could I take him! \"Why ... by using Bertha Jorkins's information, of course. Use my one faithful Death Eater, stationed at Hogwarts, to ensure that the boy's name was entered into the Goblet of Fire. Use my Death Eater to ensure that the boy won the tournament  that he touched the Triwizard Cup first  the cup which my Death Eater had turned into a Portkey, which would bring him here, beyond the reach of Dumbledore's help and protection, and into my waiting arms. And here he is ... the boy you all believed had been my downfall. ...\" Voldemort moved slowly forward and turned to face Harry. He raised his wand. \"Crucio!\" It was pain beyond anything Harry had ever experienced; his very bones were on fire; his head was surely splitting along his scar; his eyes were rolling madly in his head; he wanted it to end ... to black out... to die ... And then it was gone. He was hanging limply in the ropes binding him to the headstone of Voldemort's father, looking up into those bright red eyes through a kind of mist. The night was ringing with the sound of the Death Eaters' laughter. \"You see, I think, how foolish it was to suppose that this boy could ever have been stronger than me,\" said Voldemort. \"But I want there to be no mistake in anybody's mind. Harry Potter escaped me by a lucky chance. And I am now going to prove my power by killing him, here and now, in front of you all, when there is no Dumbledore to help him, and no mother to die for him. I will give him his chance. He will be allowed to fight, and you will be left in no doubt which of us is the stronger. Just a little longer, Nagini,\" he whispered, and the snake glided away through the grass to where the Death Eaters stood watching. \"Now untie him, Wormtail, and give him back his wand.\" \n",

            ": Flight of the Prince Harry felt as though he too were hurtling through space; it had not happened. . . . It could not have happened. ... \"Out of here, quickly,\" said Snape. He seized Malfoy by the scruff of the neck and forced him through the door ahead of the rest; Greyback and the squat brother and sister followed, the latter both panting excitedly. As they vanished through the door, Harry realized he could move again. What was now holding him paralyzed against the wall was not magic, but horror and shock. He threw the Invisibility Cloak aside as the brutal-faced Death Eater, last to leave the tower top, was disappearing through the door. \"Petrificus Totalus!\" The Death Eater buckled as though hit in the back with something solid and fell to the ground, rigid as a waxwork, but he had barely hit the floor when Harry was clambering over him and running down the darkened staircase. Terror tore at Harry;s heart. ... He had to get to Dumbledore and he had to catch Snape. ... Somehow the two things were linked. ... He could reverse what had happened if he had them both together. ... Dumbledore could not have died. ... He leapt the last ten steps of the spiral staircase and stopped where he landed, his wand raised. The dimly lit corridor was full of dust; half the ceiling seemed to have fallen in; and a battle was raging before him, but even as he attempted to make out who were fighting whom, he heard the hated voice shout, \"It's over, time to go!\" and saw Snape disappearing around the corner at the far end of the corridor; he and Malfoy seemed to have forced their way through the fight unscathed. As Harry plunged after them, one of the fighters detached themselves from the fray and flew at him: it was the werewolf, Fenrir. He was on top of Harry before Harry could raise his wand: Harry fell backward, with filthy matted hair in his face, the stench of sweat and blood filling his nose and mouth, hot greedy breath at his throat - \"Petrificus Totalus!\" Harry felt Fenrir collapse against him; with a stupendous effort he pushed the werewolf off and onto the floor as a jet of green light came flying toward him; he ducked and ran, headfirst, into the fight. His feet met something squashy and slippery on the floor and he stumbled: There were two bodies lying there, lying facedown in a pool of blood, but there was no time to investigate. Harry now saw red hair flying like flames in front of him: Ginny was locked in combat with the lumpy Death Eater, Amycus, who was throwing hex after hex at her while she dodged them: Amycus was giggling, enjoying the sport: \"Crucio - Crucio - you can't dance forever, pretty-\" \"Impedimenta!\" yelled Harry. His jinx hit Amycus in the chest: He gave a piglike squeal of pain, was lifted off his feet and slammed into the opposite wall, slid down it, and fell out of sight behind Ron, Professor McGonagall, and Lupin, each of whom was battling a separate Death Eater. Beyond them, Harry saw Tonks fighting an enormous blond wizard who was sending curses flying in all directions, so that they ricocheted off the walls around them, cracking stone, shattering the nearest window - \"Harry, where did you come from?\" Ginny cried, but there was no time to answer her. He put his head down and sprinted forward, narrowly avoiding a blast that erupted over his head, showering them all in bits of wall. Snape must not escape, he must catch up with Snape - \"Take that!\" shouted Professor McGonagall, and Harry glimpsed the female Death Eater, Alecto, sprinting away down the corridor with her arms over her head, her brother right behind her. He launched himself after them but his foot caught on something, and next moment he was lying across someone's legs. Looking around, he saw Neville's pale, round face flat against the floor. \"Neville, are you - ?\" \"M'all right,\" muttered Neville, who was clutching his stomach, \"Harry . . . Snape 'n' Malfoy . . . ran past. . .\" \"I know, I'm on it!\" said Harry, aiming a hex from the floor at the enormous blond Death Eater who was causing most of the chaos. The man gave a howl of pain as the spell hit him in the face: He wheeled around, staggered, and then pounded away after the brother and sister. Harry scrambled up from the floor and began to sprint along the corridor, ignoring the bangs issuing from behind him, the yells of the others to come back, and the mute call of the figures on the ground whose fate he did not yet know. . . . He skidded around the corner, his trainers slippery with blood; Snape had an immense head start. Was it possible that he had already entered the cabinet in the Room of Requirement, or had the Order made steps to secure it, to prevent the Death Eaters retreating that way? He could hear nothing but his own pounding feet, his own hammering heart as he sprinted along the next empty corridor, but then spotted a bloody footprint that showed at least one of the fleeing Death Eaters was heading toward the front doors - perhaps the Room of Requirement was indeed blocked - He skidded around another corner and a curse flew past him; he dived behind a suit of armor that exploded. He saw the brother and sister running down the marble staircase ahead and aimed jinxes at them, but merely hit several bewigged witches in a portrait on the landing, who ran screeching into neighboring paintings. As he leapt the wreckage of armor, Harry heard more shouts and screams; other people within the castle seemed to have awoken. . . . He pelted toward a shortcut, hoping to overtake the brother and sister and close in on Snape and Malfoy, who must surely have reached the grounds by now. Remembering to leap the vanishing step halfway down the concealed staircase, he burst through a tapestry at the bottom and out into a corridor where a number of bewildered and pajama-clad Hufflepuffs stood. \"Harry! We heard a noise, and someone said something aboui the Dark Mark -\" began Ernie Macmillan. \"Out of the way!\" yelled Harry, knocking two boys aside as he sprinted toward the landing and down the remainder of the marble staircase. The oak front doors had been blasted open, there were smears of blood on the flagstones, and several terrified students stood huddled against the walls, one or two still cowering with their arms over their faces. The giant Gryffindor hourglass had been hit by a curse, and the rubies within were still falling, with a loud rattle, onto the flagstones below. Harry flew across the entrance hall and out into the dark grounds: He could just make out three figures racing across the lawn, heading for the gates beyond which they could Disapparate - by the looks of them, the huge blond Death Eater and, some way ahead of him, Snape and Malfoy. ... The cold night air ripped at Harry's lungs as he tore after them; he saw a flash of light in the distance that momentarily silhouetted his quarry. He did not know what it was but continued to run, not yet near enough to get a good aim with a curse - Another flash, shouts, retaliatory jets of light, and Harry understood: Hagrid had emerged from his cabin and was trying to stop the Death Eaters escaping, and though every breath seemed to shred his lungs and the stitch in his chest was like fire, Harry sped up as an unbidden voice in his head said: not Hagrid. . . not Hagrid too . . . Something caught Harry hard in the small of the back and he fell forward, his face smacking the ground, blood pouring out of both nostrils: He knew, even as he rolled over, his wand ready, that the brother and sister he had overtaken using his shortcut were closing in behind him. . . . \"Impedimenta!\" he yelled as he rolled over again, crouching close to the dark ground, and miraculously his jinx hit one of them, who stumbled and fell, tripping up the other; Harry leapt to his feet and sprinted on after Snape. And now he saw the vast outline of Hagrid, illuminated by the light of the crescent moon revealed suddenly behind clouds; the blond Death Eater was aiming curse after curse at the gamekeeper; but Hagrids immense strength and the toughened skin he had inherited from his giantess mother seemed to be protecting him. Snape and Malfoy, however, were still running; they would soon be beyond the gates, able to Disapparate - Harry tore past Hagrid and his opponent, took aim at Snape's back, and yelled, \"Stupefy!\" He missed; the jet of red light soared past Snape's head; Snape shouted, \"Run, Draco!\"and turned. Twenty yards apart, he and Harry looked at each other before raising their wands simultaneously. \"Cruc - \" But Snape parried the curse, knocking Harry backward off his feet before he could complete it; Harry rolled over and scrambled back up again as the huge Death Eater behind him yelled, \"Incendio!\" Harry heard an explosive bang and a dancing orange light spilled over all of them: Hagrid's house was on fire. \"Fang's in there, yer evil - !\" Hagrid bellowed. \"Cruc -\" yelled Harry for the second time, aiming for the figure ahead illuminated in the dancing firelight, but Snape blocked the spell again. Harry could see him sneering. \"No Unforgivable Curses from you, Potter!\" he shouted over the rushing of the flames, Hagrid's yells, and the wild yelping of the trapped Fang. \"You haven't got the nerve or the ability -\" \"Incarc-\"Harry roared, but Snape deflected the spell with an almost lazy flick of his arm. \"Fight back!\" Harry screamed at him. \"Fight back, you cowardly-----\" \"Coward, did you call me, Potter?\" shouted Snape. \"Your father would never attack me unless it was four on one, what would you call him, I wonder?\" \"Stupe-\" \"Blocked again and again and again until you learn to keep your mouth shut and your mind closed, Potter!\" sneered Snape, deflecting the curse once more. \"Now come!\" he shouted at the huge Death Eater behind Harry. \"It is time to be gone, before the Ministry turns up -\" \"Impedi -\" But before he could finish this jinx, excruciating pain hit Harry; he keeled over in the grass. Someone was screaming, he would surely die of this agony, Snape was going to torture him to death or madness - \"No!\" roared Snape's voice and the pain stopped as suddenly as it had started; Harry lay curled on the dark grass, clutching his wand and panting; somewhere overhead Snape was shouting, \"Have you forgotten our orders? Potter belongs to the Dark Lord - we are to leave him! Go! Go!\" And Harry felt the ground shudder under his face as the brother and sister and the enormous Death Eater obeyed, running toward the gates. Harry uttered an inarticulate yell of rage: In that instant, he cared not whether he lived or died. Pushing himself to his feet again, he staggered blindly toward Snape, the man he now hated as much as he hated Voldemort himself - \"Sectum - \" Snape flicked his wand and the curse was repelled yet again; but Harry was mere feet away now and he could see Snape's face clearly at last: He was no longer sneering or jeering; the blazing flames showed a face full of rage. Mustering all his powers of concentration, Harry thought, Levi - \"No, Potter!\" screamed Snape. There was a loud BANG and Harry was soaring backward, hitting the ground hard again, ;un\\ this time his wand flew out of his hand. He could hear Hagrid yelling and Fang howling as Snape closed in and looked down on him where he lay, wandless and defenseless as Dumbledore hadl been. Snape's pale face, illuminated by the flaming cabin, was suffused with hatred just as it had been before he had cursed Dumbledore. \"You dare use my own spells against me, Potter? It was I who invented them - I, the Half-Blood Prince! And you'd turn my inventions on me, like your filthy father, would you? I don't think so . . . no\" Harry had dived for his wand; Snape shot a hex at it and it flew feet away into the darkness and out of sight. \"Kill me then,\" panted Harry, who felt no fear at all, but only rage and contempt. \"Kill me like you killed him, you coward -\" \"DON'T -\" screamed Snape, and his face was suddenly demented, inhuman, as though he was in as much pain as the yelping, howling dog stuck in the burning house behind them - \"CALL ME COWARD!\" And he slashed at the air: Harry felt a white-hot, whiplike something hit him across the face and was slammed backward into the ground. Spots of light burst in front of his eyes and for a moment all the breath seemed to have gone from his body, then he heard a rush of wings above him and something enormous obscured the stars. Buckbeak had flown at Snape, who staggered backward as the razor-sharp claws slashed at him. As Harry raised himself into a sitting position, his head still swimming from its last contact with the ground, he saw Snape running as hard as he could, the enormous beast flapping behind him and screeching as Harry had never heard him screech - Harry struggled to his feet, looking around groggily for his wand, hoping to give chase again, but even as his fingers fumbled in the grass, discarding twigs, he knew it would be too late, and sure enough, by the time he had located his wand, he turned only to see the hippogriff circling the gates. Snape had managed to Disapparate just beyond the school's boundaries. \"Hagrid,\" muttered Harry, still dazed, looking around. \"HAGRID?\" He stumbled toward the burning house as an enormous figure emerged from out of the flames carrying Fang on his back. With a cry of thankfulness, Harry sank to his knees; he was shaking in every limb, his body ached all over, and his breath came in painful stabs. \"Yeh all righ', Harry? Yeh all righ'? Speak ter me, Harry. . ..\" Hagrids huge, hairy face was swimming above Harry, blocking out the stars. Harry could smell burnt wood and dog hair; he put out a hand and felt Fang's reassuringly warm and alive body quivering beside him. \"I'm all right,\" panted Harry. \"Are you?\" \"'Course I am . . . take more'n that ter finish me.\" Hagrid put his hands under Harry's arms and raised him up with such force that Harry's feet momentarily left the ground before Hagrid set him upright again. He could see blood trickling down Hagrid's cheek from a deep cut under one eye, which was swelling rapidly. \"We should put out your house,\" said Harry, \"the charm's 'Aguamenti' ...\" \"Knew it was summat like that,\" mumbled Hagrid, and he raised a smoldering pink, flowery umbrella and said, \"Aguamenti!\" A jet of water flew out of the umbrella tip. Harry raised his wand arm, which felt like lead, and murmured \"Aguamenti\" too: Together, he and Hagrid poured water on the house until the last flame was extinguished. \"S'not too bad,\" said Hagrid hopefully a few minutes later, looking at the smoking wreck. \"Nothin Dumbledore won' be able to put righ' . . .\" Harry felt a searing pain in his stomach at the sound of the name. In the silence and the stillness, horror rose inside him. \"Hagrid ...\" \"I was bindin' up a couple o' bowtruckle legs when I heard 'em coming,\" said Hagrid sadly, still staring at his wrecked cabin. \"They'll bin burnt ter twigs, poor little things. . . .\" \"Hagrid . . .\" \"But what happened, Harry? I jus' saw them Death Eaters run-nin down from the castle, but what the ruddy hell was Snape doin' with 'em? Where's he gone - was he chasin' them?\" \"He . . .\" Harry cleared his throat; it was dry from panic and the smoke. \"Hagrid, he killed . . .\" \"Killed?\" said Hagrid loudly, staring down at Harry. \"Snape killed? What're yeh on abou', Harry?\" \"Dumbledore,\" said Harry. \"Snape killed .. . Dumbledore.\" Hagrid simply looked at him, the little of his face that could be seen completely blank, uncomprehending. \"Dumbledore wha, Harry?\" \"He's dead. Snape killed him....\" \"Don' say that,\" said Hagrid roughly. \"Snape kill Dumbledore - don' be stupid, Harry. Wha's made yeh say tha'?\" \"I saw it happen.\" , ,.. \"Yeh couldn' have.\" \"I saw it, Hagrid.\" Hagrid shook his head; his expression was disbelieving but sympathetic, and Harry knew that Hagrid thought he had sustained a blow to the head, that he was confused, perhaps by the aftereffects of a jinx. ... \"What musta happened was, Dumbledore musta told Snape ter go with them Death Eaters,\" Hagrid said confidently. \"I suppose he's gotta keep his cover. Look, let's get yeh back up ter the school. Come on, Harry. ...\" Harry did not attempt to argue or explain. He was still shaking uncontrollably. Hagrid would find out soon enough, too soon. ... As they directed their steps back toward the castle, Harry saw that many of its windows were lit now. He could imagine, clearly, the scenes inside as people moved from room to room, telling each other that Death Eaters had got in, that the Mark was shining over Hogwarts, that somebody must have been killed. . . . The oak front doors stood open ahead of them, light flooding out onto the drive and the lawn. Slowly, uncertainly, dressing-gowned people were creeping down the steps, looking around nervously for some sign of the Death Eaters who had fled into the night. Harry's eyes, however, were fixed upon the ground at the foot of the tallest tower. He imagined that he could see a black, huddled mass lying in the grass there, though he was really too far away to see anything of the sort. Even as he stared wordlessly at the place where he thought Dumbledore's body must lie, however, he saw people beginning to move toward it. \"What're they all lookin' at?\" said Hagrid, as he and Harry approached the castle front, Fang keeping as close as he could to their ankles. \"Wha's that lyin' on the grass?\" Hagrid added sharply, heading now toward the foot of the Astronomy Tower, where a small crowd was congregating. \"See it, Harry? Right at the foot of the tower? Under where the Mark . . . Blimey . . . yeh don' think someone got thrown - ?\" Hagrid fell silent, the thought apparently too horrible to express aloud. Harry walked alongside him, feeling the aches and pains in his face and his legs where the various hexes of the last half hour had hit him, though in an oddly detached way, as though somebody near him was suffering them. What was real and inescapable was the awful pressing feeling in his chest. . . . He and Hagrid moved, dreamlike, through the murmuring crowd to the very front, where the dumbstruck students and teachers had left a gap. Harry heard Hagrid's moan of pain and shock, but he did not stop; he walked slowly forward until he reached the place where Dumbledore lay and crouched down beside him. He had known there was no hope from the moment that the full Body-Bind Curse Dumbledore had placed upon him lifted, known that it could have happened only because its caster was dead, but there was still no preparation for seeing him here, spread-eagled, broken: the greatest wizard Harry had ever, or would ever, meet. Dumbledore's eyes were closed; but for the strange angle of his arms and legs, he might have been sleeping. Harry reached out, straightened the half-moon spectacles upon the crooked nose, and wiped a trickle of blood from the mouth with his own sleeve. Then he gazed down at the wise old face and tried to absorb the enormous and incomprehensible truth: that never again would Dumbledore speak to him, never again could he help----- The crowd murmured behind Harry. After what seemed like a long time, he became aware that he was kneeling upon something hard and looked down. The locket they had managed to steal so many hours before had fallen out of Dumbledore's pocket. It had opened, perhaps due to the force with which it hit the ground. And although he could not feel more shock or horror or sadness than he felt already, Harry knew, as he picked it up, that there was something wrong----- He turned the locket over in his hands. This was neither as large as the locket he remembered seeing in the Pensieve, nor were there any markings upon it, no sign of the ornate S that was supposed to be Slytherins mark. Moreover, there was nothing inside but for a scrap of folded parchment wedged tightly into the place where a portrait should have been. Automatically, without really thinking about what he was doing, Harry pulled out the fragment of parchment, opened it, and read by the light of the many wands that had now been lit behind him: To the Dark Lord I now I will be dead long before you read this but I want you to know that it was I who dicovered your secret. I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can. I face death in the hope that when you meet your match you will be mortal once more. R.A.B. Harry neither knew nor cared what the message meant. Only one thing mattered: This was not a Horcrux. Dumbledore had weakened himself by drinking that terrible potion for nothing. Harry crumpled the parchment in his hand, and his eyes burned with tears as behind him Fang began to howl. \n",

            " The Bribe If Kreacher could escape a lake full of Inferi, Harry was confident that the capture of Mundungus would take a few hours at most, and he prowled the house all morning in a state of high anticipation. However, Kreacher did not return that morning or even that afternoon. By nightfall, Harry felt discouraged and anxious, and a supper composed largely of moldy bread, upon which Hermione had tried a variety of unsuccessful Transfigurations, did nothing to help. Kreacher did not return the following day, nor the day after that. However, two cloaked men had appeared in the square outside number twelve, and they remained there into the night, gazing in the direction of the house that they could not see. \"Death Eaters, for sure,\" said Ron, as he, Harry, and Hermione watched from the drawing room windows. \"Reckon they know we’re in here?\" \"I don’t think so,\" said Hermione, though she looked frightened, \"or they’d have sent Snape in after us, wouldn’t they?\" \"D’you reckon he’s been in here and has his tongue tied by Moody’s curse?\" asked Ron. \"Yes,\" said Hermione, \"otherwise he’d have been able to tell that lot how to get in, wouldn’t he? But they’re probably watching to see whether we turn up. They know that Harry owns the house, after all.\" \"How do they --?\" began Harry. \"Wizarding wills are examined by the Ministry, remember? They’ll know Sirius left you the place.\" The presence of the Death Eaters outside increased the ominous mood inside number twelve. They had not heard a word form anyone beyond Grimmauld Place since Mr. Weasley’s Patronus, and the strain was starting to tell. Restless and irritable, Ron had developed an annoying habit of playing with the Deluminator in his pocket; This particularly infuriated Hermione, who was whiling away the wait for Kreacher by studying The Tales of Beedle the Bard and did not appreciate the way the lights kept flashing on and off. \"Will you stop it!\" she cried on the third evening of Kreacher’s absence, as all the light was sucked from the drawing room yet again. \"Sorry, sorry!\" said Ron, clicking the Deluminator and restoring the lights. \"I don’t know I’m doing it!\" \"Well, can’t you find something useful to occupy yourself?\" \"What, like reading kids’ stories?\" \"Dumbledore left me this book, Ron -\" \"-and he left me the Deluminator, maybe I’m supposed to use it!\" Unable to stand the bickering, Harry slipped out of the room unnoticed by either of them. He headed downstairs toward the kitchen, which he kept visiting because he was sure that was where Kreacher was most likely to reappear. Halfway down the flight of stairs into the hall, however, he heard a tap on the front door, then metallic clicks and the grinding of the chain. Every nerve in his body seemed to tauten: He pulled out his wand, moved into the shadows beside the decapitated elf heads, and waited. The door opened: He saw a glimpse of the lamplit square outside, and a cloaked figure edged into the hall and closed the door behind it. The intruder took a step forward, and Moody’s voice asked, \"Severus Snape?\" Then the dust figure rose from the end of the hall and rushed him, raising its dead hand. \"It was not I who killed you, Albus,\" said a quiet voice. The jinx broke: The dust-figure exploded again, and it was impossible to make out the newcomer through the dense gray cloud it left behind. Harry pointed the wand into the middle of it. \"Don’t move!\" He had forgotten the portrait of Mrs. Black: At the sound of his yell, the curtains hiding her flew open and she began to scream, \"Mudbloods and filth dishonoring my house -\" Ron and Hermione came crashing down the stairs behind Harry, wands pointing, like his, at the unknown man now standing with his arms raised in the hall below. \"Hold your fire, it’s me, Remus!\" \"Oh, thank goodness,\" said Hermione weakly, pointing her wand at Mrs. Black instead; with a bang, the curtains swished shut again and silence fell. Ron too lowered his wand, but Harry did not. \"Show yourself!\" he called back. Lupin moved forward into the lamplight, hands still held high in a gesture of surrender. \"I am Remus John Lupin, werewolf, sometimes known as Moony, one of the four creators of the Marauder’s Map, married to Nymphadora, usually known as Tonks, and I taught you how to produce a Patronus, Harry, which takes the form of a stag.\" \"Oh, all right,\" said Harry, lowering his wand, \"but I had to check, didn’t I?\" \"Speaking as your ex-Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, I quite agree that you had to check. Ron, Hermione, you shouldn’t be so quick to lower your defenses.\" They ran down the stairs towards him. Wrapped in a thick black traveling cloak, he looked exhausted, but pleased to see them. \"No sign of Severus, then?\" he asked. \"No,\" said Harry. \"What’s going on? Is everyone okay?’ \"Yes,\" said Lupin, \"but we’re all being watched. There are a couple of Death Eaters in the square outside -\" \"We know -\" \"I had to Apparate very precisely onto the top step outside the front door to be sure that they would not see me. They can’t know you’re in here or I’m sure they’d have more people out there; they’re staking out everywhere that’s got any connection with you, Harry. Let’s go downstairs, there’s a lot to tell you, and I want to know what happened after you left the Burrow.\" They descended into the kitchen, where Hermione pointed her wand at the grate. A fire sprang up instantly: It gave the illusion of coziness to the stark stone walls and glistened off the long wooden table. Lupin pulled a few butterbeers from beneath his traveling cloak and they sat down. \"I’d have been here three days ago but I needed to shake off the Death Eater tailing me,\" said Lupin. \"So, you came straight here after the wedding?\" \"No,\" said Harry, \"only after we ran into a couple of Death Eaters in a café on Tottenham Court Road.\" Lupin slopped most of his butterbeer down his front. \"What?\" They explained what had happened; when they had finished, Lupin looked aghast. \"But how did they find you so quickly? It’s impossible to track anyone who Apparates, unless you grab hold of them as they disappear.\" \"And it doesn’t seem likely they were just strolling down Tottenham Court Road at the time, does it?\" said Harry. \"We wondered,\" said Hermione tentatively, \"whether Harry could still have the Trace on him?\" \"Impossible,\" said Lupin. Ron looked smug, and Harry felt hugely relieved. \"Apart from anything else, they’d know for sure Harry was here if he still had the Trace on him, wouldn’t they? But I can’t see how they could have tracked you to Tottenham Court Road, that’s worrying, really worrying.\" He looked disturbed, but as far as Harry was concerned, that question could wait. \"Tell us what happened after we left, we haven’t heard a thing since Ron’s dad told us the family was safe.\" \"Well, Kingsley saved us,\" said Lupin. \"Thanks to his warning most of the wedding guests were able to Disapparate before they arrived.\" \"Were they Death Eaters or Ministry people?\" interjected Hermione. \"A mixture; but to all intents and purposes they’re the same thing now,\" said Lupin. \"There were about a dozen of them, but they didn’t know you were there, Harry. Arthur heard a rumor that they tried to torture your whereabouts out of Scrimgeour before they killed him; if it’s true, he didn’t give you away.\" Harry looked at Ron and Hermione; their expressions reflected the mingled shock and gratitude he felt. He had never liked Scrimgeour much, but if what Lupin said was true, the man’s final act had been to try to protect Harry. \"The Death Eaters searched the Burrow from top to bottom,\" Lupin went on. \"They found the ghoul, but didn’t want to get too close - and then they interrogated those of us who remained for hours. They were trying to get information on you, Harry, but of course nobody apart from the Order knew that you had been there. \"At the same time that they were smashing up the wedding, more Death Eaters were forcing their way into every Order-connected house in the country. No deaths,\" he added quickly, forestalling the question, \"but they were rough. They burned down Dedalus Diggle’s house, but as you know he wasn’t there, and they used the Cruciarus Curse on Tonks’s family. Again, trying to find out where you went after you visited them. They’re all right - shaken, obviously, but otherwise okay.\" \"The Death Eaters got through all those protective charms?\" Harry asked, remembering how effective these had been on the night he had crashed in Tonks’s parents’ garden. \"What you’ve got to realize, Harry, is that the Death Eaters have got the full might of the Ministry on their side now,\" said Lupin. \"They’ve got the power to perform brutal spells without fear of identification or arrest. They managed to penetrate every defensive spell we’d cast against them, and once inside, they were completely open about why they’d come.\" \"And are they bothering to give an excuse for torturing Harry’s whereabouts out of people?\" asked Hermione, an edge to her voice. \"Well,\" Lupin said. He hesitated, then pulled out a folded copy of the Daily Prophet. \"Here,\" he said, pushing it across the table to Harry, \"you’ll know sooner or later anyway. That’s their pretext for going after you.\" Harry smoothed out the paper. A huge photograph of his own face filled the front page. He read the headline over it: WANTED FOR QUESTIONING ABOUT THE DEATH OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE Ron and Hermione gave roars of outrage, but Harry said nothing. He pushed the newspaper away; he did not want to read anymore: He knew what it would say. Nobody but those who had been on top of the tower when Dumbledore died knew who had really killed him and, as Rita Skeeter had already told the Wizarding world, Harry had been seen running from the place moments after Dumbledore had fallen. \"I’m sorry, Harry,\" Lupin said. \"So Death Eaters have taken over the Daily Prophet too?\" asked Hermione furiously. Lupin nodded. \"But surely people realize what’s going on?\" \"The coup has been smooth and virtually silent,\" said Lupin. \"The official version of Scrimgeour’s murder is that he resigned; he has been replaced by Pius Thicknesse, who is under the Imperius Curse.\" \"Why didn’t Voldemort declare himself Minister of Magic?\" asked Ron. Lupin laughed. \"He doesn’t need to, Ron. Effectively, he is the Minister, but why should he sit behind a desk at the Ministry? His puppet, Thicknesse, is taking care of everyday business, leaving Voldemort free to extend his power beyond the Ministry. \"Naturally many people have deduced what has happened: There has been such a dramatic change in Ministry policy in the last few days, and many are whispering that Voldemort must be behind it. However, that is the point: They whisper. They daren’t confide in each other, not knowing whom to trust; they are scared to speak out, in case their suspicions are true and their families are targeted. Yes, Voldemort is playing a very clever game. Declaring himself might have provoked open rebellion: Remaining masked has created confusion, uncertainty, and fear.\" \"And this dramatic change in Ministry policy,\" said Harry, \"involves warning the Wizarding world against me instead of Voldemort?\" \"That’s certainly a part of it,\" said Lupin, \"and it is a masterstroke. Now that Dumbledore is dead, you - the Boy Who Lived - were sure to be the symbol and rallying point for any resistance to Voldemort. But by suggesting that you had a hand in the old hat’s death, Voldemort has not only set a price upon your head, but sown doubt and fear amongst many who would have defended you. \"Meanwhile, the Ministry has started moving against Muggle-borns.\" Lupin pointed at the Daily Prophet. \"Look at page two.\" Hermione turned the pages with much the same expression of distaste she had when handling Secrets of the Darkest Art. \"Muggle-born Register!\" she read aloud. \"‘The Ministry of Magic is undertaking a survey of so-called \"Muggle-borns\" the better to understand how they came to possess magical secrets. \"‘Recent research undertaken by the Department of Mysteries reveals that magic can only be passed from person to person when Wizards reproduce. Where no proven Wizarding ancestry exists, therefore, the so-called Muggle-born is likely to have obtained magical power by theft or force. \"‘The Ministry is determined to root out such usurpers of magical power, and to this end has issued an invitation to every so-called Muggle-born to present themselves for interview by the newly appointed Muggle-born Registration Commission.’\" \"People won’t let this happen,\" said Ron. \"It is happening, Ron,\" said Lupin. \"Muggle-borns are being rounded up as we speak.\" \"But how are they supposed to have ‘stolen’ magic?\" said Ron. \"It’s mental, if you could steal magic there wouldn’t be any Squibs, would there?\" \"I know,\" said Lupin. \"Nevertheless, unless you can prove that you have at least one close Wizarding relative, you are now deemed to have obtained your magical power illegally and must suffer the punishment.\" Ron glanced at Hermione, then said, \"What if purebloods and halfbloods swear a Muggle-born’s part of their family? I’ll tell everyone Hermione’s my cousin -\" Hermione covered Ron’s hand with hers and squeezed it. \"Thank you, Ron, but I couldn’t let you -\" \"You won’t have a choice,\" said Ron fiercely, gripping her hand back. \"I’ll teach you my family tree so you can answer questions on it.\" Hermione gave a shaky laugh. \"Ron, as we’re on the run with Harry Potter, the most wanted person in the country, I don’t think it matters. If I was going back to school it would be different. What’s Voldemort planning for Hogwarts?\" she asked Lupin. \"Attendance is now compulsory for every young witch and wizard,\" he replied. \"That was announced yesterday. It’s a change, because it was never obligatory before. Of course, nearly every witch and wizard in Britain has been educated at Hogwarts, but their parents had the right to teach them at home or send them abroad if they preferred. This way, Voldemort will have the whole Wizarding population under his eye from a young age. And it’s also another way of weeding out Muggle-borns, because students must be given Blood Status - meaning that they have proven to the Ministry that they are of Wizard descent - before they are allowed to attend.\" Harry felt sickened and angry: At this moment, excited eleven-year-olds would be poring over stacks of newly purchased spell-books, unaware that they would never see Hogwarts, perhaps never see their families again either. \"It’s . . . it’s . . .\" he muttered, struggling to find words that did justice to the horror of his thoughts, but Lupin said quietly, \"I know.\" Lupin hesitated. I’ll understand if you can’t confirm this, Harry, but the Order is under the impression that Dumbledore left you a mission.\" \"He did,\" Harry replied, \"and Ron and Hermione are in on it and they’re coming with me.\" \"Can you confide in me what the mission is?\" Harry looked into the prematurely lined face, framed in thick but graying hair, and wished that he could return a different answer. \"I can’t, Remus, I’m sorry. If Dumbledore didn’t tell you I don’t think I can.\" \"I thought you’d say that,\" said Lupin, looking disappointed. \"But I might still be of some use to you. You know what I am and what I can do. I could come with you to provide protection. There would be no need to tell me exactly what you were up to.\" Harry hesitated. It was a very tempting offer, though how they would be able to keep their mission secret from Lupin if he were with them all the time he could not imagine. Hermione, however, looked puzzled. \"But what about Tonks?\" she asked. \"What about her?\" said Lupin. \"Well,\" said Hermione, frowning, \"you’re married! How does she feel about you going away with us?\" \"Tonks will be perfectly safe,\" said Lupin, \"She’ll be at her parents’ house.\" There was something strange in Lupin’s tone, it was almost cold. There was also something odd in the idea of Tonks remaining hidden at her parents’ house; she was, after all, a member of the Order and, as far as Harry knew, was likely to want to be in the thick of the action. \"Remus,\" said Hermione tentatively, \"is everything all right . . . you know . . . between you and - \" \"Everything is fine, thank you,\" said Lupin pointedly. Hermione turned pink. There was another pause, an awkward and embarrassed one, and then Lupin said, with an air of forcing himself to admit something unpleasant, \"Tonks is going to have a baby.\" \"Oh, how wonderful!\" squealed Hermione. \"Excellent!\" said Ron enthusiastically. \"Congratulations,\" said Harry. Lupin gave an artificial smile that was more like a grimace, then said, \"So . . . do you accept my offer? Will three become four? I cannot believe that Dumbledore would have disapproved, he appointed me your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, after all. And I must tell you that I believe we are facing magic many of us have never encountered or imagined.\" Ron and Hermione both looked at Harry. \"Just - just to be clear,\" he said. \"You want to leave Tonks at her parents’ house and come away with us?\" \"She’ll be perfectly safe there, they’ll look after her,\" said Lupin. He spoke with a finality bordering on indifference: \"Harry, I’m sure James would have wanted me to stick with you.\" \"Well,\" said Harry slowly, \"I’m not. I’m pretty sure my father would have wanted to know why you aren’t sticking with your own kid, actually.\" Lupin’s face drained of color. The temperature in the kitchen might have dropped ten degrees. Ron stared around the room as though he had been bidden to memorize it, while Hermione’s eyes swiveled backward and forward from Harry to Lupin. \"You don’t understand,\" said Lupin at last. \"Explain, then,\" said Harry. Lupin swallowed. \"I - I made a grave mistake in marrying Tonks. I did it against my better judgment and have regretted it very much every since.\" \"I see,\" said Harry, \"so you’re just going to dump her and the kid and run off with us?\" Lupin sprang to his feet: His chair toppled over backward, and he glared at them so fiercely that Harry saw, for the first time ever, she shadow of the wolf upon his human face. \"Don’t you understand what I’ve done to my wife and my unborn child? I should never have married her, I’ve made her an outcast!\" Lupin kicked aside the chair he had overturned. \"You have only ever seen me amongst the Order, or under Dumbledore’s protection at Hogwarts! You don’t know how most of the Wizarding world sees creatures like me! When they know of my affliction, they can barely talk to me! Don’t you see what I’ve done? Even her own family is disgusted by our marriage, what parents want their only daughter to marry a werewolf? And the child - the child - \" Lupin actually seized handfuls of his own hair; he looked quite deranged. \"My kind don’t usually breed! It will be like me, I am convinced of it - how can I forgive myself, when I knowingly risked passing on my own condition to an innocent child? And if, by some miracle, it is not like me, then it will be better off, a hundred times so, without a father of whom it must always be ashamed!\" \"Remus!\" whispered Hermione, tears in her eyes. \"Don’t say that - how could any child be ashamed of you?\" \"Oh, I don’t know, Hermione,\" said Harry. \"I’d be pretty ashamed of him.\" Harry did not know where his rage was coming from, but it had propelled him to his feet too. Lupin looked as though Harry had hit him. \"If the new regime thinks Muggle-borns are bad,\" Harry said, \"what will they do to a half-werewolf whose father’s in the Order? My father died trying to protect my mother and me, and you reckon he’d tell you to abandon your kid to go on an adventure with us?\" \"How - how dare you?\" said Lupin. \"This is not about a desire for - for danger or personal glory - how dare you suggest such a - \" \"I think you’re feeling a bit of a daredevil,\" Harry said, \"You fancy stepping into Sirius’s shoes -\" \"Harry, no!\" Hermione begged him, but he continued to glare into Lupin’s livid face. \"I’d never have believed this,\" Harry said. \"The man who taught me to fight dementors - a coward.\" Lupin drew his wand so fast that Harry had barely reached for his own; there was a loud bang and he felt himself flying backward as if punched; as he slammed into the kitchen wall and slid to the floor, he glimpsed the tail of Lupin’s cloak disappearing around the door. \"Remus, Remus, come back!\" Hermione cried, but Lupin did not respond. A moment later they heard the front door slam. \"Harry!\" wailed Hermione. \"How could you?\" \"It was easy,\" said Harry. He stood up, he could feel a lump swelling where his head had hit the wall. He was still so full of anger he was shaking. \"Don’t look at me like that!\" he snapped at Hermione. \"Don’t you start on her!\" snarled Ron. \"No - no - we mustn’t fight!\" said Hermione, launching herself between them. \"You shouldn’t have said that stuff to Lupin,\" Ron told Harry. \"He had it coming to him,\" said Harry. Broken images were racing each other through his mind: Sirius falling through the veil; Dumbledore suspended, broken, in midair; a flash of green light and his mother’s voice, begging for mercy . . . \"Parents,\" said Harry, \"shouldn’t leave their kids unless - unless they’ve got to.\" \"Harry -\" said Hermione, stretching out a consoling hand, but he shrugged it off and walked away, his eyes on the fire Hermione had conjured. He had once spoken to Lupin out of that fireplace, seeking reassurance about James, and Lupin had consoled him. Now Lupin’s tortured white face seemed to swim in the air before him. He felt a sickening surge of remorse. Neither Ron nor Hermione spoke, but Harry felt sure that they were looking at each other behind his back, communicating silently. He turned around and caught them turning hurriedly away form each other. \"I know I shouldn’t have called him a coward.\" \"No, you shouldn’t,\" said Ron at once. \"But he’s acting like one.\" \"All the same . . .\" said Hermione. \"I know,\" said Harry. \"But if it makes him go back to Tonks, it’ll be worth it, won’t it?\" He could not keep the plea out of his voice. Hermione looked sympathetic, Ron uncertain. Harry looked down at his feet, thinking of his father. Would James have backed Harry in what he had said to Lupin, or would he have been angry at how his son had treated his old friend? The silent kitchen seemed to hum with the shock of the recent scene and with Ron and Hermione’s unspoken reproaches. The Daily Prophet Lupin had brought was still lying on the table, Harry’s own face staring up at the ceiling from the front page. He walked over to it and sat down, opened the paper at random, and pretended to read. He could not take in the words; his mind was still too full of the encounter with Lupin. He was sure that Ron and Hermione had resumed their silent communications on the other side of the Prophet. He turned a page loudly, and Dumbledore’s name leapt out at him. It was a moment or two before he took in the meaning of the photograph, which showed a family group. Beneath the photograph were the words: The Dumbledore family, left to right: Albus; Percival, holding newborn Ariana; Kendra, and Aberforth. His attention caught, Harry examined the picture more carefully. Dumbledore’s father, Percival, was a good-looking man with eyes that seemed to twinkle even in this faded old photograph. The baby, Ariana, was a little longer than a loaf of bread and no more distinctive-looking. The mother, Kendra, had jet black hair pulled into a high bun. Her face had a carved quality about it. Harry thought of photos of Native Americans he’d seen as he studied her dark eyes, high cheekbones, and straight nose, formally composed above a high-necked silk gown. Albus and Aberforth wore matching lacy collared jackets and had identical, shoulder-length hairstyles. Albus looked several years older, but otherwise the two boys looked very alike, for this was before Albus’s nose had been broken and before he started wearing glasses. The family looked quite happy and normal, smiling serenely up out of the newspaper. Baby Ariana’s arm waved vaguely out of her shawl. Harry looked above the picture and saw the headline: EXCLUSIVE EXTRACT FROM UPCOMING BIOGRAPHY OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE by Rita Skeeter Thinking it could hardly make him feel any worse than he already did, Harry began to read: Proud and haughty, Kendra Dumbledore could not bear to remain in Mould-on-the-Wold after her husband Percival’s well-publicized arrest and imprisonment in Azkaban. She therefore decided to uproot the family and relocate to Godric’s Hollow, the village that was later to gain fame as the scene of Harry Potter’s strange escape from You-Know-Who. Like Mould-on-the-Wold, Godric’s Hollow was home to a number of Wizarding families, but as Kendra knew none of them, she would be spared the curiosity about her husband’s crime she had faced in her former village. By repeatedly rebuffing the friendly advances of her new Wizarding neighbors, she soon ensured that her family was left well alone. \"Slammed the door in my face when I went around to welcome her with a batch of homemade Cauldron Cakes,\" says Bathilda Bagshot. \"The first year they were there I only ever saw the two boys. Wouldn’t have known there was a daughter if I hadn’t been picking Plangentines by moonlight the winter after they moved in, and saw Kendra leading Ariana out into the back garden. Walked her round the lawn once, keeping a firm grip on her, then took her back inside. Didn’t know what to make of it.\" It seems that Kendra thought the move to Godric’s Hollow was the perfect opportunity to hide Ariana once and for all, something she had probably been planning for years. The timing was significant. Ariana was barely seven years old when she vanished from sight, and seven is the age by which most experts agree that magic will have revealed itself, if present. Nobody now alive remembers Ariana ever demonstrating even the slightest sign of magical ability. It seems clear, therefore, that Kendra made a decision to hide her daughter’s existence rather than suffer the shame of admitting that she had produced a Squib. Moving away from the friends and neighbors who knew Ariana would, of course, make imprisoning her all the easier. The tiny number of people who henceforth knew of Ariana’s existence could be counted upon to keep the secret, including her two brothers, who had deflected awkward questions with the answer their mother had taught them. \"My sister is too frail for school.\" Next week: Albus Dumbledore at Hogwarts - the Prizes and the Pretense. Harry had been wrong: What he had read had indeed made him feel worse. He looked back at the photograph of the apparently happy family. Was it true? How could he find out? He wanted to go to Godric’s Hollow, even if Bathilda was in no fit state to talk to him: he wanted to visit the place where he and Dumbledore had both lost loved ones. He was in the process of lowering the newspaper, to ask Ron’s and Hermione’s opinions, when a deafening crack echoed around the kitchen. For the first time in three days Harry had forgotten all about Kreacher. His immediate thought was that Lupin had burst back into the room, and for a split second, he did not take in the mass of struggling limbs that had appeared out of thin air right beside his chair. He hurried to his feet as Kreacher disentangled himself and, bowing low to Harry, croaked, \"Kreacher has returned with the thief Mundungus Fletcher, Master.\" Mundungus scrambled up and pulled out his wand; Hermione, however, was too quick for him. \"Expelliarmus!\" Mundungus’s wand soared into the air, and Hermione caught it. Wild-eyed, Mundungus dived for the stairs. Ron rugby-tackled him and Mundungus hit the stone floor with a muffled crunch. \"What?\" he bellowed, writhing in his attempts to free himself from Ron’s grip. \"Wha’ve I done? Setting a bleedin’ ‘house-elf on me, what are you playing at, wha’ve I done, lemme go, lemme go, of - \" \"You’re not in much of a position to make threats,\" said Harry. He threw aside the newspaper, crossed the kitchen in a few strides, and dropped to his knees beside Mundungus, who stopped struggling and looked terrified. Ron got up, panting, and watched as Harry pointed his wand deliberately at Mundungus’s nose. Mundungus stank of stale sweat and tobacco smoke. His hair was matted and his robes stained. \"Kreacher apologizes for the delay in bringing the thief, Master,\" croaked the elf. \"Fletcher knows how to avoid capture, has many hidey-holes and accomplices. Nevertheless, Kreacher cornered the thief in the end.\" \"You’ve done really well, Kreacher,\" said Harry, and the elf bowed low. \"Right, we’ve got a few questions for you,\" Harry told Mundungus, who shouted at once. \"I panicked, okay? I never wanted to come along, no offense, mate, but I never volunteered to die for you, an’ that was bleedin’ You-Know-Who come flying at me, anyone woulda got outta there. I said all along I didn’t wanna do it -\" \"For your information, none of the rest of us Disapparated,\" said Hermione. \"Well, you’re a bunch of bleedin’ ‘eroes then, aren’t you, but I never pretended I was up for killing meself -\" \"We’re not interested in why you ran out on Mad-Eye,\" said Harry, moving his wand a little closer to Mundungus’s baggy, bloodshot eyes. \"We already knew you were an unreliable bit of scum.\" \"Well then, why the ‘ell am I being ‘unted down by ‘ouse-elves? Or is this about them goblets again? I ain’t got none of ‘em left, or you could ‘ave ‘em -\" \"It’s not about the goblets either, although you’re getting warmer,\" said Harry. \"Shut up and listen.\" It felt wonderful to have something to do, someone of whom he could demand some small portion of truth. Harry’s wand was now so close to the bridge of Mundungus’s nose that Mundungus had gone cross-eyed trying to keep it in view. \"When you cleaned out this house of anything valuable,\" Harry began, but Mundungus interrupted him again. \"Sirius never cared about any of the junk -\" There was the sound of pattering fee, a blaze of shining copper, an echoing clang, and a shriek of agony; Kreacher had taken a run at Mundungus and hit him over the head with a saucepan. \"Call ‘im off, call ‘im off, ‘e should be locked up!\" screamed Mundungus, cowering as Kreacher raised the heavy-bottomed pan again. \"Kreacher, no!\" shouted Harry. Kreacher’s thin arms trembled with the weight of the pan, still held aloft. \"Perhaps just one more, Master Harry, for luck?\" Ron laughed. \"We need him conscious, Kreacher, but if he needs persuading, you can do the honors,\" said Harry. \"Thank you very much, Master,\" said Kreacher with a bow, and he retreated a short distance, his great pale eyes still fixed upon Mundungus with loathing. \"When you stripped this house of all the valuables you could find,\" Harry began again, \"you took a bunch of stuff from the kitchen cupboard. There was a locket there.\" Harry’s mouth was suddenly dry: He could sense Ron and Hermione’s tension and excitement too. \"What did you do with it?\" \"Why?\" asked Mundungus. \"Is it valuable?\" \"You’ve still got it!\" cried Hermione. \"No, he hasn’t,\" said Ron shrewdly. \"He’s wondering whether he should have asked more money for it.\" \"More?\" said Mundungus. \"That wouldn’t have been effing difficult . . .bleedin’ gave it away, di’n’ I? No choice.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"I was selling in Diagon Alley and she come up to me and asks if I’ve got a license for trading in magical artifacts. Bleedin’ snoop. She was gonna fine me, but she took a fancy to the locket an’ told me she’d take it and let me off that time, and to fink meself lucky.\" \"Who was this woman?\" asked Harry. \"I dunno, some Ministry hag.\" Mundungus considered for a moment, brow wrinkled. \"Little woman. Bow on top of ‘er head.\" He frowned and then added, \"Looked like a toad.\" Harry dropped his wand: It hit Mundungus on the nose and shot red sparks into his eyebrows, which ignited. \"Aquamenti!\" screamed Hermione, and a jet of water streamed from her wand, engulfing a spluttering and choking Mundungus. Harry looked up and saw his own shock reflected in Ron’s and Hermione’s faces. The scars on the back of his right hand seemed to be tingling again. \n",

            " THIRTYFOUR  PRIORI INCANTATEM Wormtail approached Harry, who scrambled to find his feet, to support his own weight before the ropes were untied. Wormtail raised his new silver hand, pulled out the wad of material gagging Harry, and then, with one swipe, cut through the bonds tying Harry to the gravestone. There was a split second, perhaps, when Harry might have considered running for it, but his injured leg shook under him as he stood on the overgrown grave, as the Death Eaters closed ranks, forming a tighter circle around him and Voldemort, so that the gaps where the missing Death Eaters should have stood were filled. Wormtail walked out of the circle to the place where Cedric's body lay and returned with Harry's wand, which he thrust roughly into Harry's hand without looking at him. Then Wormtail resumed his place in the circle of watching Death Eaters. \"You have been taught how to duel. Harry Potter?\" said Voldemort softly, his red eyes glinting through the darkness. At these words Harry remembered, as though from a former life, the dueling club at Hogwarts he had attended briefly two years ago. ... All he had learned there was the Disarming Spell, \"Expelliarmus\". . . and what use would it be to deprive Voldemort of his wand, even if he could, when he was surrounded by Death Eaters, outnumbered by at least thirty to one? He had never learned anything that could possibly fit him for this. He knew he was facing the thing against which Moody had always warned . . . the unblockable Avada Kedavra curse  and Voldemort was right  his mother was not here to die for him this time. ... He was quite unprotected. . . . \"We bow to each other. Harry,\" said Voldemort, bending a little, but keeping his snakelike face upturned to Harry. \"Come, the niceties must be observed. . . . Dumbledore would like you to show manners. . . . Bow to death, Harry. ...\" The Death Eaters were laughing again. Voldemorts lipless mouth was smiling. Harry did not bow. He was not going to let Voldemort play with him before killing him ... he was not going to give him that satisfaction. . . . \"I said, bow,\" Voldemort said, raising his wand  and Harry felt his spine curve as though a huge, invisible hand were bending him ruthlessly forward, and the Death Eaters laughed harder than ever. \"Very good,\" said Voldemort softly, and as he raised his wand the pressure bearing down upon Harry lifted too. \"And now you face me, like a man . . . straightbacked and proud, the way your father died. . . . \"And now  we duel.\" Voldemort raised his wand, and before Harry could do anything to defend himself, before he could even move, he had been hit again by the Cruciatus Curse. The pain was so intense, so allconsuming, that he no longer knew where he was. . . . Whitehot knives were piercing every inch of his skin, his head was surely going to burst with pain, he was screaming more loudly than he'd ever screamed in his life  And then it stopped. Harry rolled over and scrambled to his feet; he was shaking as uncontrollably as Wormtail had done when his hand had been cut off; he staggered sideways into the wall of watching Death Eaters, and they pushed him away, back toward Voldemort. \"A little break,\" said Voldemort, the slitlike nostrils dilating with excitement, \"a little pause . . . That hurt, didn't it. Harry? You don't want me to do that again, do you?\" Harry didn't answer. He was going to die like Cedric, those pitiless red eyes were telling him so ... he was going to die, and there was nothing he could do about it... but he wasn't going to play along. He wasn't going to obey Voldemort... he wasn't going to beg. . . . \"I asked you whether you want me to do that again,\" said Voldemort softly. \"Answer me! Imperial\" And Harry felt, for the third time in his life, the sensation that his mind had been wiped of all thought. . . . Ah, it was bliss, not to think, it was as though he were floating, dreaming ...just answer no ... say no ... just answer no. .. . I will not, said a stronger voice, in the back of his head, I won't answer. . . . Just answer no. . . . I won't do it, I won't say it. ... Just answer no. . . . \"I WON'T!\" And these words burst from Harry's mouth; they echoed through the graveyard, and the dream state was lifted as suddenly as though cold water had been thrown over him  back rushed the aches that the Cruciatus Curse had left all over his body  back rushed the realization of where he was, and what he was facing. . . . \"You won't?\" said Voldemort quietly, and the Death Eaters were not laughing now. \"You won't say no? Harry, obedience is a virtue I need to teach you before you die. . . . Perhaps another little dose of pain?\" Voldemort raised his wand, but this time Harry was ready; with the reflexes born of his Quidditch training, he flung himself sideways onto the ground; he rolled behind the marble headstone of Voldemort s father, and he heard it crack as the curse missed him. \"We are not playing hideandseek, Harry,\" said Voldemort's soft, cold voice, drawing nearer, as the Death Eaters laughed. \"You cannot hide from me. Does this mean you are tired of our duel? Does this mean that you would prefer me to finish it now, Harry? Come out, Harry . . . come out and play, then ... it will be quick ... it might even be painless ... I would not know... I have never died. . . .\" Harry crouched behind the headstone and knew the end had come. There was no hope ... no help to be had. And as he heard Voldemort draw nearer still, he knew one thing only, and it was beyond fear or reason: He was not going to die crouching here like a child playing hideandseek; he was not going to die kneeling at Voldemort s feet... he was going to die upright like his father, and he was going to die trying to defend himself, even if no defense was possible. . . . Before Voldemort could stick his snakelike face around the headstone. Harry stood up ... he gripped his wand tightly in his hand, thrust it out in front of him, and threw himself around the headstone, facing Voldemort. Voldemort was ready. As Harry shouted, \"Expelliarmus!\" Voldemort cried, \"Avada Kedavra!\" A jet of green light issued from Voldemorts wand just as a jet of red light blasted from Harry's  they met in midair  and suddenly Harry's wand was vibrating as though an electric charge were surging through it; his hand seized up around it; he couldn't have released it if he'd wanted to  and a narrow beam of light connected the two wands, neither red nor green, but bright, deep gold. Harry, following the beam with his astonished gaze, saw that Voldemort's long white fingers too were gripping a wand that was shaking and vibrating. And then  nothing could have prepared Harry for this  he felt his feet lift from the ground. He and Voldemort were both being raised into the air, their wands still connected by that thread of shimmering golden light. They glided away from the tombstone of Voldemort's father and then came to rest on a patch of ground that was clear and free of graves. . . . The Death Eaters were shouting; they were asking Voldemort for instructions; they were closing in, reforming the circle around Harry and Voldemort, the snake slithering at their heels, some of them drawing their wands  The golden thread connecting Harry and Voldemort splintered; though the wands remained connected, a thousand more beams arced high over Harry and Voldemort, crisscrossing all around them, until they were enclosed in a golden, domeshaped web, a cage of light, beyond which the Death Eaters circled like jackals, their cries strangely muffled now. . . . \"Do nothing!\" Voldemort shrieked to the Death Eaters, and Harry saw his red eyes wide with astonishment at what was happening, saw him fighting to break the thread of light still connecting his wand with Harry's; Harry held onto his wand more tightly, with both hands, and the golden thread remained unbroken. \"Do nothing unless I command you!\" Voldemort shouted to the Death Eaters. And then an unearthly and beautiful sound filled the air. ... It was coming from every thread of the lightspun web vibrating around Harry and Voldemort. It was a sound Harry recognized, though he had heard it only once before in his life: phoenix song. It was the sound of hope to Harry. . . the most beautiful and welcome thing he had ever heard in his life. . . . He felt as though the song were inside him instead of just around him. ... It was the sound he connected with Dumbledore, and it was almost as though a friend were speaking in his ear. . . . Don't break the connection. I know. Harry told the music, I know I mustn't. . . but no sooner had he thought it, than the thing became much harder to do. His wand began to vibrate more powerfully than ever . . . and now the beam between him and Voldemort changed too ... it was as though large beads of light were sliding up and down the thread connecting the wands  Harry felt his wand give a shudder under his hand as the light beads began to slide slowly and steadily his way. . . . The direction of the beams movement was now toward him, from Voldemort, and he felt his wand shudder angrily. . . . As the closest bead of light moved nearer to Harrys wand tip, the wood beneath his fingers grew so hot he feared it would burst into flame. The closer that bead moved, the harder Harry's wand vibrated; he was sure his wand would not survive contact with it; it felt as though it was about to shatter under his fingers  He concentrated every last particle of his mind upon forcing the bead back toward Voldemort, his ears full of phoenix song, his eyes furious, fixed . . . and slowly, very slowly, the beads quivered to a halt, and then, just as slowly, they began to move the other way . . . and it was Voldemort's wand that was vibrating extrahard now . . . Voldemort who looked astonished, and almost fearful. . . . One of the beads of light was quivering, inches from the tip of Voldemorts wand. Harry didn't understand why he was doing it, didn't know what it might achieve . . . but he now concentrated as he had never done in his life on forcing that bead of light right back into Voldemort s wand . . . and slowly . . . very slowly ... it moved along the golden thread ... it trembled for a moment. . . and then it connected. . . . At once, Voldemorts wand began to emit echoing screams of pain . . . then  Voldemort's red eyes widened with shock  a dense, smoky hand flew out of the tip of it and vanished . . . the ghost of the hand he had made Wormtail. . . more shouts of pain . . . and then something much larger began to blossom from Voldemorts wand tip, a great, grayish something, that looked as though it were made of the solidest, densest smoke. ... It was a head . . . now a chest and arms . . . the torso of Cedric Diggory. If ever Harry might have released his wand from shock, it would have been then, but instinct kept him clutching his wand tightly, so that the thread of golden light remained unbroken, even though the thick gray ghost of Cedric Diggory (was it a ghost? it looked so solid) emerged in its entirety from the end of Voldemort s wand, as though it were squeezing itself out of a very narrow tunnel. . . and this shade of Cedric stood up, and looked up and down the golden thread of light, and spoke. \"Hold on. Harry,\" it said. Its voice was distant and echoing. Harry looked at Voldemort ... his wide red eyes were still shocked ... he had no more expected this than Harry had . . . and, very dimly. Harry heard the frightened yells of the Death Eaters, prowling around the edges of the golden dome. . More screams of pain from the wand . . . and then something else emerged from its tip ... the dense shadow of a second head, quickly followed by arms and torso ... an old man Harry had seen only in a dream was now pushing himself out of the end of the wand just as Cedric had done . . . and his ghost, or his shadow, or whatever it was, fell next to Cedric's, and surveyed Harry and Voldemort, and the golden web, and the connected wands, with mild surprise, leaning on his walking stick. . . . \"He was a real wizard, then?\" the old man said, his eyes on Voldemort. \"Killed me, that one did. . . . You fight him, boy. . . .\" But already, yet another head was emerging ... and this head, gray as a smoky statue, was a woman's. . . . Harry, both arms shaking now as he fought to keep his wand still, saw her drop to the ground and straighten up like the others, staring. . . . The shadow of Bertha Jorkins surveyed the battle before her with wide eyes. \"Don't let go, now!\" she cried, and her voice echoed like Cedrics as though from very far away. \"Don't let him get you, Harry  don't let go!\" She and the other two shadowy figures began to pace around the inner walls of the golden web, while the Death Eaters flitted around the outside of it... and Voldemort's dead victims whispered as they circled the duelers, whispered words of encouragement to Harry, and hissed words Harry couldn't hear to Voldemort. And now another head was emerging from the tip of Voldemorts wand . . . and Harry knew when he saw it who it would be ... he knew, as though he had expected it from the moment when Cedric had appeared from the wand . . . knew, because the man appearing was the one he'd thought of more than any other tonight. . . . The smoky shadow of a tall man with untidy hair fell to the ground as Bertha had done, straightened up, and looked at him . . . and Harry, his arms shaking madly now, looked back into the ghostly face of his father. \"Your mother's coming . . .\" he said quietly. \"She wants to see you ... it will be all right.. . hold on. . . .\" And she came. . . first her head, then her body... a young woman with long hair, the smoky, shadowy form of Lily Potter blossomed from the end of Voldemort's wand, fell to the ground, and straightened like her husband. She walked close to Harry, looking down at him, and she spoke in the same distant, echoing voice as the others, but quietly, so that Voldemort, his face now livid with fear as his victims prowled around him, could not hear. . .. \"When the connection is broken, we will linger for only moments . . . but we will give you time. . . you must get to the Portkey, it will return you to Hogwarts ... do you understand, Harry?\" \"Yes,\" Harry gasped, fighting now to keep a hold on his wand, which was slipping and sliding beneath his fingers. \"Harry . . .\" whispered the figure of Cedric, \"take my body back, will you? Take my body back to my parents, ...\" \"I will,\" said Harry, his face screwed up with the effort of holding the wand. \"Do it now,\" whispered his father's voice, \"be ready to run . . . do it now. ...\" \"NOW!\" Harry yelled; he didn't think he could have held on for another moment anyway  he pulled his wand upward with an almighty wrench, and the golden thread broke; the cage of light vanished, the phoenix song died  but the shadowy figures of Voldemort's victims did not disappear  they were closing in upon Voldemort, shielding Harry from his gaze  And Harry ran as he had never run in his life, knocking two stunned Death Eaters aside as he passed; he zigzagged behind headstones, feeling their curses following him, hearing them hit the headstones  he was dodging curses and graves, pelting toward Cedric's body, no longer aware of the pain in his leg, his whole being concentrated on what he had to do  \"Stun him!\" he heard Voldemort scream. Ten feet from Cedric, Harry dived behind a marble angel to avoid the jets of red light and saw the tip of its wing shatter as the spells hit it. Gripping his wand more tightly, he dashed out from behind the angel  \"Impedimenta!\" he bellowed, pointing his wand wildly over his shoulder at the Death Eaters running at him. From a muffled yell, he thought he had stopped at least one of them, but there was no time to stop and look; he jumped over the cup and dived as he heard more wand blasts behind him; more jets of light flew over his head as he fell, stretching out his hand to grab Cedric's arm... \"Stand aside! I will kill him! He is mine!\" shrieked Voldemort. Harry's hand had closed on Cedric's wrist; one tombstone stood between him and Voldemort, but Cedric was too heavy to carry, and the cup was out of reach  Voldemort's red eyes flamed in the darkness. Harry saw his mouth curl into a smile, saw him raise his wand. \"Accio!\" Harry yelled, pointing his wand at the Triwizard Cup. It flew into the air and soared toward him. Harry caught it by the handle  He heard Voldemort s scream of fury at the same moment that he felt the jerk behind his navel that meant the Portkey had worked  it was speeding him away in a whirl of wind and color, and Cedric along with him. . . . They were going back. \n",

            "-Six The Flaw in the Plan He was flying facedown on the grond again. The smell of the forest filled his nostrils. He could feel the cold hard ground beneath his cheek, and the hinge of his glasses which have been knocked sideways by the fall cutting into his temple. Every inch of him ached, and the place where Killing Curse had hit him felt like the bruise of an iron-clad punch. He did not stir, but he remained exactly where he had fallen, with his left arm bent out at an akward angle and his mouth gaping. He had expected to hear cheer of triumph and jubilation at his death, but instead hurried footsteps, whispers, and solicitous murmurs filled the air. \"My Lord... my Lord...\" It was Bellatrix's voice, and she spoke as if to a lover. Harry did not dare open his eyes, but allowed his other senses to explore his predicament. He knew that his wand was still stowed beneath his robes because he could feel it pressed between his chest and the ground. A slight cushioning effect in the area of his stomach told him that the Invisibility Cloak was also there, stuffed out of sight. \"My Lord...\" \"That will do,\" said Voldemort's voice. More footsteps. Several people were backing away from the same spot. Desperate to see what was happening and why, Harry opened his eyes by a milimeter. Voldemort seemed to be getting to his feet. Various Death Eaters were hurrying away from him, returning to the crowd lining the clearing. Bellatrix alone remained behind, kneeling beside Voldemort. Harry closed his eyes again and considered what he had seen. The Death Eaters have been buddled around Voldemort, who seem to have fallen to the ground. Something had happened when he had hit Harry with the Killing Curse. Had Voldemort too collapsed? It seemed like it. And both of them had briefly fallen unconcious and both of them had now returned. . . \"My Lord, let me --\" \"I do not require assitance,\" said Voldemort coldly, and though he could not see it, Harry pictured Bellatrix withdrawing a helpful hand. \"The boy . . . Is he dead?\" There was a complete silence in the clearing. Nobody approached Harry, but he felt their concentraded gaze; it seemed to press him harder into the ground, and he was terrified a finger or an eyelid might twitch. \"You,\" said Voldemort, and there was a bang and a small shrick of pain. \"Examine him. Tell me whether he is dead.\" Harry did not know who had been sent to verify. He could only lie there, with his heart thumping traitorously, and wait to be examined, but at the same time nothing, small comfort through it was, that Voldemort was wary of approaching him, that Voldemort suspected that all had not gone to plan . . . . Hands, softer than he had been expecting, touched Harry's face, and felt his heart. He could hear the woman's fast breathing, her pounding of life against his ribs. \"Is Draco alive? Is he in the castle?\" The whisper was barely audible, her lips were an inch from his car, her head bent so low that her long hair shielded his face from the onlookers. \"Yes,\" he breathed back. He felt the hand on his chest contract: her nails pierced him. Then it was withdrawn. She had sat up. \"He is dead!\" Narcissa Malfoy called to the watchers. And now they shouted, now they yelled in triumph and stamped their feet, and through his eyelids, Harry saw bursts of red and silver light shoot into the air in celebration. Still feigning death on the ground, he understood. Narcissa knew that the only way she would be permitted to enter Hogwarts, and find her son, was as part of the conquering army. She no longer cared whether Voldemort won. \"You see?\" screeched Voldemort over the tumult. \"Harry Potter is dead by my hand, and no man alive can threaten me now! Watch! Crucio!\" Harry had been expecting it, knew his body would not be allowed to remain unsullied upon the forest floor; it must be subjected to humiliation to prove Voldemort's victory. He was lifted into the air, and it took all his determination to remain limp, yet the pain he expected did not come. He was thrown once, twice, three times into the air. His glasses flew off and he felt his wand slide a little beneath his robes, but he kept himself floppy and lifeless, and when he fell no ground for the last time, the clearing echoed with jeers and shrieks of laughter. \"Now,\" said Voldemort, \"we go to the castle, and show them what has become of their hero. Who shall drag the body? No - Wait - \" There was a fresh outbreak of laughter, and after a few moments Harry felt the ground trembling beneath him. \"You carry him,\" Voldemort said. \"He will be nice and visible in your arms, will he not? Pick up your little friend, Hagrid. And the glasses - put on the glasses - he must be recognizable - \" Someone slammed Harry's glasses back onto his face with deliberate force, but the enormous hands that lifted him into the air were exceedingly gentle. Harry could feel Hagrid's arms trembling with the force of his heaving sobs; great tears splashed down upon him as Hagrid cradled Harry in his arms, and Harry did not dare, by movement or word, to intimate to Hagrid that all was not, yet, lost. \"Move,\" said Voldemort, and Hagrid stumbled forward, forcing his way through the close-growing trees, back through the forest. Branches caught at Harry's hair and robes, but he lay quiescent, his mouth lolling open, his eyes shut, and in the darkness, while the Death Eaters croed all around them, and while Hagrid sobbed blindly, nobody looked to see whether a pulse beat in the exposed neck of Harry Potter. . . . The two giants crashed along behind the Death Eaters; Harry could hear trees creaking and falling as they passed; they made so much din that birds toes shrieking into the sky, and even the jeers of the Death Eaters were drowned. The victorious procession marched on toward the open ground, and after a while Harry could tell, by the lightening of the darkness through his closed eyelids, that the trees were beginning to thin. \"BANE!\" Hagrid's unexpected bellow nearly forced Harry's eyes open. \"Happy now, are yeh, that yeh didn't fight, yeh cowardly bunch o' nags? Are yeh happy Harry Potter's - d-dead . . . ?\" Hagrid could not continue, but broke down in fresh tears. Harry wondered how many centaurs were watching their procession pass; he dared not open his eyes to look. Some of the Death Eaters called insults at the centaurs as they left them behind. A little later, Harry sensed, by a freshening of the air, that they had reached the edge of the forest. \"Stop.\" Harry thought that Hagrid must have been forced to obey Voldemort's command, because he lurched a little. And now a chill settled over them where they sood, and Harry heard the rasping breath of the dementors that patrolled the other trees. They would not affect him now. The fact of his own survival burned inside him, a talisman against them, as though his father's stag kept guardian in his heart. Someone passed close by Harry, and he knew that it was Voldemort himself because he spoke a moment later, his voice magically magnified so that it swelled through the ground, crashing upon Harry's eardrums. \"Harry Potter is dead. He was killed as he ran away, trying to save himself while you lay down your lives for him. We bring you his body as proof that your hero is gone. \"The battle is won. You have lost half of your fighters. My Death Eaters outnumber you, and the Boy Who Lived is finished. There must be no more war. Anyone who continues to resist, man, woman or child, will be slaughtered, as will every member of their family. Come out of the castle now, kneel before me, and you shall be spared. Your parents and children, your brothers and sisters will live and be forgiven, and you will join me in the new world we shall build togheter.\" There was silence in the grounds and from the castle. Voldemort was so close to him that Harry did not dare open his eyes again. \"Come,\" said Voldemort, and Harry heard him move ahead, and Hagrid was forced to follow. Now Harry opened his eyes a fraction, and saw Voldemort striding in front them, wearing the great snake Nagini around his shoulders, now free of her enchanted cage. But Harry had no possibility of extracting the wand concealed under his robes without being noticed by the Death Eaters, who marched on the either side of them through the slowly lightening darkness . . . . \"Harry,\" sobbed Hagrid. \"Oh, Harry . . . Harry . . .\" Harry shut his eyes tight again. He knew that they were approaching the castle and strained his ears to distinguish, above the gleeful voices of the Death Eaters and their tramping footsteps, signs of life from those within. \"Stop.\" The Death Eaters camte to a halt; Harry heard them spreading out in a line facing the opne front doors of the school. He could see, even though his closed lids, the teddish glow that meant light streamed upon him from the entrance hall. He waited. Any moment, the people for whom he had tried to die would see him, lying apparently dead, in Hagrid's arms. \"NO!\" The scream was the more terrible because he had never expected or dreamed that Professor McGonagall could make such a sound. He heard another women laughing nearby, and knew that Bellatrix gloried in McGonagall's despair. He squinted again for a single second and saw the open doorway filling with people, as the survivors of the battle came out onto the front steps to face their vanquishers and see the truth of Harry's death for themselves. He saw Voldemort standing a little in front of him, stroking Nagini's head with a single white finger. He closed his eyes again. \"No!\" \"No!\" \"Harry! HARRY!\" Ron's, Hermione's, and Ginny's voices were worse than McGonagall's; Harry wanted nothing more than to call back, yet he made himself lie silent, and their cries acted like a trigger; the crowd of survivors took up the cause, screaming and yelling abuse at the Death Eathers, until - \"SILENCE!\" cried Voldemort, and there was a bang and a flash of bright light, and silence was forced upn them all. \"It is over! Set him down, Hagrid, at my feet, where he belongs!\" Harry felt himself lowered onto the grass. \"You see? said Voldemort, and Harry felt him striding backward and forward right beside the place where he lay. \"Harry Potter is dead! Do you understand now, deluded ones? He was nothing, ever, but a boy who relied on others to sacrifice themselves for him!\" \"He beat you!\" yelled Ron, and the charm broke, and the defenders of Hogwarts were shouting and screaming again until a second, more powerful bang extinguished their voices once more. \"He was killed while trying to sneak out of the castle grounds,\" said Voldemort, and there was a relish in his voice for the lie. \"killed while trying to save himself - \" But Voldemort broke off: Harry heard a scuffle and a shout, then another bang, a flash of light, and grunt of pain; he opened his eyes an infinitesimal amount. Someone had broken free of the crowd and charged at Voldemort: Harry saw the figure hit the ground. Disarmed, Voldemort throwing the challenger's wand aside and laughing. \"And who is this?\" he said in his soft snake's hiss. \"Who has volunteered to demonstrate what happens to those who continue to fight when the battle is lost?\" Bellatrix gave a delighted laugh. \"It is Neville Longbottom, my Lord! The boy who has been giving the Carrows so much trouble! The son of the Aurors, remember?\" \"Ah, yes, I remember,\" said Voldemort, looking down at Neville, who was struggling back to his feet, unarmed and unproctected, standing in the no-man's-land between the survivors and the Death Eaters. \"But you are a pureblood, aren't you, my brave boy? Voldemort asked Neville, who stood facing him, his empty hands curled in fists. \"So what if I am?\" said Neville loudly. \"You show spirit and bravery, and you come of noble stock. You will make a very valuable Death Eater. We need your kind, Neville Longbottom.\" \"I'll join you when hell freezes over,\" said Neville. \"Dumbledore's Army!\" he shouted, and there was an answering cheer from the crowd, whom Voldemort's Silencing Charms seemed unable to hold. \"Very well,\" said Voldemort, and Harry heard more danger in the silkiness of his voice than in the most powerful curse. \"If that is your choice, Longbottom, we revert to the original plan. On your head,\" he said quietly, \"be it.\" Still watching through his lashes, Harry saw Voldemort wave his wand. Seconds later, out of one of the castle's shattered windows, something that looked like a misshapen bird flew through the half light and landed in Voldemort's hand. He shook the mildewed object by its pointed end and it dangled, emtpy and ragged: the Sorting Hat. \"There will be no more Sorting at Hogwarts School,\" said Voldemort. \"There will be no more Houses. The emblem, sheild and colors of my noble ancestor, Salazar Slythering, will suffice everyone. Won't they, Neville Longbottom?\" He pointed his wand at Neville, who grew rigid and still, then forced the hat onto Neville's head, so thta it slipped down below his eyes. There were movements from the watching crowd in front of the castle, and as one, the Death Eaters raised their wands, holding the fighters of Hogwarts at bay. \"Neville here is now going to demonstrate what happens to anyone foolish enough to continue to oppose me,\" said Voldemort, and with a flick of his wand, he caused the Sorting Hat to burst into flames. Screams split the dawn, and Neville was a flame, rooted to the spot, unable to move, and Harry could not bear it: He must act - And then many things happened at the same moment. They heard uproar from the distant boundary of the school as what sounded like hundreds of people came swarming over the out-of-sight walls and pelted toward the castle, uttering lowd war cries. At the same time, Grawp came lumbering around the side of the castel and yelled, \"HAGGER!\" His cry was answered by roars from Voldemort's giants: They ran at Grawp like bull elephants making the earth quake. Then came hooves and the twangs of bows, and arrows were suddenly falling amongst the Death Eaters, who broke ranks, shouting their surprise. Harry pulled the Invisibilty Cloak from inside his robes, swunt it over himself, and sprang to his feet, as Neville moved too. In one swift, fluid motin, Neville broke free of the Body-Bind Curse upon him; the flaming har fell off him and he drew from its depths something silver, with a glittering, rubied handle - The slash of the silver blade could not be heard over the roar of the oncoming crowd or the sounds of the clashing giants or of te stampending centaurs, and yet, it seemd to draw every eye. With a single stroke Neville sliced off the great snake's head, which spun high into the air, gleaming in the light flooding from the entrance hall, and Voldemort's mouth was open in a scream of fury that nobody could hear, and the snake's body thudded to the ground at his feet- Hidden beneath the Invisibilty Cloak, Harry cast a Shield Charm between Neville and Voldemort before the latter could raise his stamps of the battling giants, Hagrid's yell came loudets of all. \"HARRY!\" Hagrid shouted. \"HARRY - WHERE'S HARRY?\" Chaos reigned. The charging centaurs were scattering the Death Eaters, everyone was feeling the giants' stamping feet, and nearer and nearar thundered the reinforcements that had come from who knew where; Harry saw great winget creatues soaring the heads of Voldemort's giants, thestrals and Buckbeak the hippogriff scratching at their eyes while Grawp punched and pummeled them and now the wizards, defenders of Hogwarts and Death Eaters alike were being forced back into the castle. Harry was shooting jinxes and curses at any Death Eater he could see, and they crumpled, not knowing what or who had hit them, and their bodies were trampled by the retreating crowd. Still hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, Harry was buffered into the entrance hall: He was searching for Voldemort and saw him across the room, firing spells from his wand as he backed into the Great Hall, still screaming instructions to his followers as he sent curses flying left and right; Harry cast more Shield Charms, and Voldemort's would-be victims. Seamus Finnigan and Hannah Abbott, datted past him into the Great Hall, where they joined the fight already flourishing inside it. And now there were more, even more people storming up the front steps, and Harry saw Charlie Weasly overtaking Horace Slughorn, who was still wearing his emeral pijamas. They seemed to have returned at the head of what looked like the families and friends of every Hogwarts student who had remained to fight along with the shopkeeps and homeowners of Hogsmeade. The centaurs Bane, Ronan and Magorian burst into the hall with a great clatter of hooves, as behind Harry the door that led to the kitchens was blasted off its hinges. The house-elves of Hogwarts swarmed intot he entrance hall, screaming and waving carving knives and cleaver, and at their head, the locker of Regulus Black bouncing on his chest, was Kreacher, his bullfrog's voice audible even above this din: \"Fight! Fight! Fight for my Master, defender of house-elves! Fight the Dark Lord, in the name of brave Regulus! Fight!\" They were hacking and stabbing at the ankles and shim of Death Eaters their tiny faces alive with malice, and everywhere Harry looked Death Eaters were folding under sheer weight of numbers, overcome by spells, dragging arrows from wounds, stabbed in the leg by elves, or else simply attempting to escape, but swallowed by the oncoming horde. But it was not over yet: Harry sped between duelers, past atruggling prosoners, and into he Great Hall. Voldemort was in the center of the battle, and he was striking and smiting al within reach. Harry could not get a clear shot, but fought his way nearer, still invisible, and the Great Hall became more and more crowded as everyone who could walk forced their way inside. Harry saw Yaxley slammed tot he floor by George and Lee Jordan, saw Dolohov fall with a scream at Flitwick's hands, saw Walden Macnair thrown across the room by Hagrid, hit the stone wall opposite, and slide unconscious to the ground. He saw Ron and Neville bringing down Fenrir Greyback. Aberforth Stunning Rookwood, Arthur and Percy flooting Thicknesse, and Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy running through the crowd, not even attempting to fight, screaming for their son. Voldemort was now dueling McGonagall, Slughorn, Kingsley all at once, and there was a cold hatred in his face as they wove and ducked around him, unable to finish him - Bellatrix was still fighing too, fifty yards away from Voldemort, and like her master she dueled three at once: Hermione, Ginny and Luna, all battling their hardest, but Bellatrix was equal to them, and Harry's attention was diverted as a Killing Curse shot so close to Ginny that she missed death by an inch - He changed course, running at Bellatrix rather than Voldemort, but before he had gone a few steps he was knocked sideways. \"NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!\" Mrs. Weasley threw off her cloak as she ran, freeing her arms, Bellatrix spun on the spot, roaring with laughter at the sight of the new challenger. \"OUT OF MY WAY!\" shouted Mrs. Weasley to the three girls, and with a simple swipe of her wand she began to duel. Harry watched with terror and elation as Molly Weasley's wand slashed and twisted, and Bellatrix Lestrange's smile faltered and became a snarl. Jets of light flew from both wands, the floor around the withces' feet became bot and cracked; both woman were fighting to kill. \"No!\" Mrs. Weasley cried as a few students ran forward, trying to come to her aid. \"Get back! Get back! She is mine!\" Hundreds of people now lined the walls, watching the two fights, Voldemort and his three opponents, Bellatrix and Molly, and Harry stood, invisible, torn between both, wanting to attack and yet to protect, unable to be sure that he would not hit the innocent. \"What will happen to your children when I've killed you?\" taunted Bellatrix, as mad as her master, capering as Molly's curses danced around her. \"When Mummy's gone the same way as Freddie?\" \"You - will - never - touch - our - children - again!\" screamed Mrs. Weasley. Bellatrix laughed the same exhilarated laugh her cousin Sirius had given as he toppled backward through the veil, and suddenly Harry knew what was going to happen before it did. Molly's curse soared beneath Bellatrix's constreched arm and hit her squarely in the chest, directly over her heart. Bellatrix's glounting smile froze, her eyes seemd to bulge: For the tiniest space of time she knew what had happened, and then she toppled, and the watching crowd roared, and Voldemord screamed. Harry felt as though he turned into slow motin: he saw McGonagall, Kingsley and Slughorn blasted backward, flailing and writhing through the air, as Voldemort's fury at the fall of his last, best leutenant exploded with the force of a bomb, Voldemort raised his wand and directed it at Molly Weasley. \"Protego!\" roared Harry, and the Shield Charm expanded in the middle of the Hall, and Voldemort stared around for the source as Harry pulled off the Invisibility Cloak at last. The yell of shock, the cheers, the screams on every side of :\"Harry!\" \"HE'S ALIVE!\" were stifled at once. The crowd was afraid, and silence fell abruptly and completely as Voldemort and Harry looked at each other, and began, at the same moment, to circle each other. \"I don't want anyone else to help,\" Harry said loudly, and in the total silence his voice carried like a trumpet call. \"It's got to be like this. It's got to be me.\" Voldemort hissed. \"Potter doesn't mean that,\" he said, his red eyes wide. \"This isn't how he works, is it? Who are you going to use as a shield today, Potter?\" \"Nobody,\" said Harry simply. \"There are no more Horcruxes. It's just you and me. Neither can live while the other survives, and one of us is about to leave for good. . . .\" \"One of us?\" jeered Voldemort, and his wholy body was taut and his red eyes stared, a snake that was about to strike. \"You think it will be you, do you, the boy who has survived by accident, and because Dumbledore was pulling the strings?\" \"Accident, was it, when my mother died to save me?\" asked Harry. They were still moving sideways, both of them, in that perfect circle, maintaining the same distance from each other, and for Harry no face existed but Voldemort's. \"Accident, when I decided to fight in that graveyard? Accident, that I didn't defend myself tonight, and still survived, and returned to fight again?\" \"Accidents!\" screamed Voldemort, but still he did not strike, and the watching crowd was frozen as if Petrified, and of the hundreds in the Hall, nobody seemed to breathe but they two. \"Accident and chance and the fact that you crouched and sniveled behind the skirts of greater men and women, and permitted me to kill them for you!\" \"You won't be killing anyone else tonight,\" said Harry as they circled, and stared into each other's eyes, green into red. \"You won't be able to kill any of them ever again. Don't you get it? I was ready to die to stop you from hurting these people - \" \"But you did not!\" \" - I meant to, and that's what did it. I've done what my mother did. They're protected from you. Haven't you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding? You can't torture them. You can't touch them. You don't learn from your mistakes, Riddle, do you?\" \"You dare -\" \"Yes, I dare,\" said Harry. \"I know things you don't know, Tom Riddle. I know lots of important things that you don't. Want to hear some, before you make another big mistake?\" Voldemort did not speak, but powled in a circle, and Harry knew that he kept him temporarily mesmerized at bay, held back by the faintest possibility that Harry might indeed know a final secret. . . . \"Is it love again?\" said Voldemort, his snake's face jeering. \"Dumbledore favorite solution, love, which he claimed conqered death, though love did not stop him falling from the tower and breaking like and old waxwork? Love, which did not prevent me stamping out your Modblood mother like a cockroack, Potter - and nobody seems to love you enough to run forward this time and take my curse. So what will stop you dying now when I strike?\" \"Just one thing,\" said Harry, and still they circled each other, wrapped in each other, held apart by nothing but the last secret. \"If it is not love that will save you this time,\" said Voldemort, \"you must believe that you have magic that i do not, or else a weapon more powerful than mine?\" \"I believe both,\" said Harry, and he saw shock flit across the snakelike face, though it was instantly dispelled; Voldemort began to laugh, and the sound was more frightening than his screams; humorles and insane, it echoed around the silent Hall. \"You think you know more magic than I do?\" he said. \"Than I, than Lord Voldemort, who has performed magic that Dumbledore himself never dreamed of?\" \"Oh he dreamed of it,\" said Harry, \"but he knew more than you, knew enough not to do what you've done.\" \"You mean he was weak!\" screamed Voldemort. \"Too weak to dare, too weak to take what might have been his, what will be mine!\" \"No, he was cleverer than you,\" said Harry, \"a better wizard, a better man.\" \"I brought about the death of Albus Dumbledore!\" \"You thought you did,\" said Harry, \"but you were wrong.\" For the frist time, the watching crowd stirred as the hundreds of people around the walls drew breath as one. \"Dumbledore is dead!\" Voldemort hurled the words at Harry as in the marble tomb in the grounds of this castle, I have seen it, Potter, and he will not return!\" \"Yes, Dumbledore is dead,\" said Harry calmly, \"but you didn't have him killed. He chose his own manner of dying, chose it months before he died, arranged the whole thing with the man you thought was your servant.\" \"What chldish dream is this?\" said Voldemort, but still he did not strike, and his red eyes did not waver from Harry's. \"Severus Snape wasn't yours,\" said Harry. \"Snape was Dumbledore's. Dumbledore's from the moment you starting hunting down my mother. And you never realized it, because of the thing you can't understand. You never saw Snape cast a Patronus, did you, Riddle?\" Voldemort did not answer. They continued to circle each other like wolves about to tear each other apart. \"Snape's Patronus was a doe,\" said Harry, \"the same as my mother's, because he loved her for nearly all of his life, from the time when they were children. You should have realized,\" he said as he saw Voldemort's nostrils flare, \"he asked you to spare her life, didn't he?\" \"He desired her, that was all,\" sneered Voldemort, \"but when she had gone, he agreed that there were other women, and of purer blood, worhier of him - \" \"Of course he told you that,\" said Harry, \"but he was Dumbledore's spy from the moment you threatened her, and he's been working against you ever since! Dumbledore was already dying when Snape finished him!\" \"It matters not!\" shrieked Voldemort, who had followed every word with rapt attention, but now let out a cackle of mad laughter. \"It matters not whether Snape was mine or Dumbledore's, or what petty obstacles they tried to put in my path! I crushed them as I crushed your mother, Snape's supposed great love! Oh, but it all makes sense, Potter, and in ways that you do not understand! \"Dumbledore was trying to keep the Elder Wand from me! He intended that Snape should be the true master of the wand! But I got there ahead of you, little boy - I reached the wand before you could get your hands on it, I understood the truth before you caught up. I killed Severus Snape three hours ago, and the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny is truly mine! Dumbledore's last plan went wrong, Harry Potter!\" \"Yeah, it did.\" said Harry. \"You're right. But before you try to kill me, I'd advise you think what you've done . . . . Think, and try for some remorse, Riddle. . . .\" \"What is this?\" Of all the things that Harry had said to him, beyond any revelation or taunt, nothing had socked Voldemort like this. Harry saw is pupils contract to thin slits, saw the skin around his eyes whiten. \"It's your one last chance,\" said Harry, \"it's all you've got left. . . . I've seen what you'll be otherwise. . . . Be a man. . . try. . . Try for some remorse. . . .\" \"You dare --- ?\" said Voldemort again. \"Yes, I dare,\" said Harry, \"because Dumbledore’s last plan hasn’t backfired on me at all. It’s backfired on you, Riddle.\" Voldemort’s hand was trembling on the Elder Wand, and Harry gripped Draco’s very tightly. The moment, he knew, was seconds away. \"That wand still isn’t working properly for you because you murdered the wrong person. Severus Snape was never the true master of the Elder Wand. He never defeated Dumbledore.\" \"He killed --- \" \"Aren’t you listening? Snape never beat Dumbledore! Dumbledore’s death was planned between them! Dumbledore instended to die, undefeated, the wand’s last true master! If all had gone as planned, the wand’s power would have died with him, because it had never been won from him!\" \"But then, Potter, Dumbledore as good as gave me the wand!\" Voldemort’s voice shook with malicious pleasure. \"I stole the wand from its last master’s tomb! I removed it against the last master’s wishes! Its power is mine!\" \"You still don’t get it, Riddle, do you? Possessing the wand isn’t enough! Holding it, using it, doesn’t make it really yours. Didn’t you listen to Ollivander? The wand chooses the wizard . . . The Elder Wand recognized a new master before Dumbledore died, someone who never even laid a hand on it. The new master removed the wand from Dumbledore against his will, never realizing exactly what he had done, or that the world’s most dangerous wand had given him its allegiance . . .\" Voldemort’s chest rose and fell rapidly, and Harry could feel the curse coming, feel it building inside the wand pointed at his face. \"The true master of the Elder Wand was Draco Malfoy.\" Blank shock showed in Voldemort’s face for a moment, but then it was gone. \"But what does it matter?\" he said softly. \"Even if you are right, Potter, it makes no difference to you and me. You no longer have the phoenix wand: We duel on skill alone . . . and after I have killed you, I can attend to Draco Malfoy . . .\" \"But you’re too late,\" said Harry. \"You’ve missed your chance. I got there first. I overpowered Draco weeks ago. I took his wand from him.\" Harry twitched the hawthorn wand, and he felt the eyes of everyone in the Hall upon it. \"So it all comes down to this, doesn’t it?\" whispered Harry. \"Does the wand in your hand know its last master was Disarmed? Because if it does . . . I am the true master of the Elder Wand.\" A red-glow burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above them as an edge of dazzling sun appeared over the sill of the nearest window. The light hit both of their faces at the same time, so that Voldemort’s was suddenly a flaming blur. Harry heard the high voice shriek as he too yelled his best hope to the heavens, pointing Draco’s wand: \"Avada Kedavra!\" \"Expelliarmus!\" The bang was like a cannon blast, and the golden flames that erupted between them, at the dead center of the circle they had been treading, marked the point where the spells collided. Harry saw Voldemort’s green jet meet his own spell, saw the Elder Wand fly high, dark against the sunrise, spinning across the enchanted ceiling like the head of Nagini, spinning through the air toward the master it would not kill, who had come to take full possession of it at last. And Harry, with the unerring skill of the Seeker, caught the wand in his free hand as Voldemort fell backward, arms splayed, the slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upward. Tom Riddle hit the floor with a mundane finality, his body feeble and shrunken, the white hands empty, the snakelike face vacant and unknowing. Voldemort was dead, killed by his own rebounding curse, and Harry stood with two wands in his hand, staring down at his enemy’s shell. One shivering second of silence, the shock of the moment suspended: and then the tumult broke around Harry as the screams and the cheers and the roars of the watchers rent the air. The fierce new sun dazzled the windows as they thundered toward him, and the first to reach him were Ron and Hermione, and it was their arms that were wrapped around him, their incomprehensible shouts that deafened him. The Ginny, Neville, and Luna were there, and then all the Weasleys and Hagrid, and Kingsley and McGonagall and Flitwick and Sprout, and Harry could not hear a word that anyone was shouting, not tell whose hands were seizing him, pulling him, trying to hug some part of him, hundreds of them pressing in, all of them determined to touch the Boy Who Lived, the reason it was over at last --- The sun rose steadily over Hogwarts, and the Great Hall blazed with life and light. Harry was an indispensible part of the mingled outpourings of jubilation and mourning, of grief and celebration. They wanted him there with them, their leader and symbol, their savior and their guide, and that he had not slept, that he craved the company of only a few of them, seemed to occur to no one. He must speak to the bereaved, clasp their hands, witness their tears, receive their thanks, hear the news now creeping in from every quarter as the morning drew on; that the Imperiused up and down the country had come back to themselves, that Death Eaters were fleeing or else being captured, that the innocent of Azkaban were being released at that very moment, and that Kingsley Shacklebolt had been named temporary Minister of Magic. They moved Voldemort’s body and laid it in a chamber off the Hall, away form the bodies of Fred, Tonks, Lupin, Colin Creevey, and fifty others who had died fighting him. McGonagall had replaced the House tables, not nobody was sitting according to House anymore: All were jumbled together, teachers and pupils, ghosts and parents, centaurs and house-elves, and Firenze lay recovering in the corner, and Grawp peered in through a smashed window, and people were throwing food into his laughing mouth. After a while, exhausted and drained, Harry found himself sitting on a bench beside Luna. \"I’d want some peace and quiet, if it were me,\" she said. \"I’d love some,\" he replied. \"I’ll distract them all,\" she said. \"Use your cloak.\" And before he could say a word, she had cried, \"Oooh, look, a Blibbering Humdinger!\" and pointed out the window. Everyone who heard looked around, and Harry slid the Cloak up over himself, and got to his feet. Now he could move through the Hall without interference. He spotted Ginny two tables away; she was sitting with her head on her mother’s shoulder: There would be time to talk later, hours and days and maybe years in which to talk. He saw Neville, the sword of Gryffindor lying beside his plate as he ate, surrounded by a knot of fervent admirers. Along the aisle between the tables he walked, and he spotted the three Malfoys, huddled together as though unsure whether or not they were supposed to be there, but nobody was paying them any attention. Everywhere he looked, he saw families reunited, and finally, he saw the two whose company he craved most. \"It’s me,\" he muttered, crouching down between them. \"Will you come with me?\" They stood up at once, and together he, Ron and Hermione left the Great Hall. Great chunks were missing from the marble staircase, part of the balustrade gone, and rubble and bloodstains occurred ever few steps as their climbed. Somewhere in the distance they could hear Peeves zooming through the corridors singing a victory song of his own composition: We did it, we bashed them, wee Potter’s the one, And Voldy’s gone moldy, so now let’s have fun! \"Really gives a feeling for the scope and tragedy of the thing, doesn’t it?\" said Ron, pushing open a door to let Harry and Hermione through. Happiness would come, Harry though, but at the moment it was muffled by exhaustion, and the pain of losing Fred and Lupin and Tonks pierced him like a physical wound every few steps. Most of all he felt the most stupendous relief, and a longing to sleep. But first he owed an explanation to Ron and Hermione, who had stuck with him for so long, and who deserved the truth. Painstakingly he recounted what he had seem in the Pensieve and what had happened in the forest, and they had not even begun to express all their shock and amazement, when at last they arrived at the place to which they had been walking, though none of them had mentioned their destination. Since he had last seen it, the gargoyle guarding the entrance to the headmaster’s study had been knocked aside; it stood lopsided, looking a little punch-drunk, and Harry wondered whether it would be able to distinguish passwords anymore. \"Can we go up?\" he asked the gargoyle. \"Feel free,\" groaned the statue. They clambered over him and onto the spiral stone staircase that moved slowly upward like an escalator. Harry pushed open the door at the top. He had one, brief glimpse of the stone Pensieve on the desk where he had left it, and then an earsplitting noise made him cry out, thinking of curses and returning Death Eaters and the rebirth of Voldemort --- But it was applause. All around the walls, the headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts were giving him a standing ovation; they waved their hats and in some cases their wigs, they reached through their frames to grip each other’s hands; they danced up and down on their chairs in which they have been painted: Dilys Derwent sobbed unashamedly; Dexter Fortescue was waving his ear-trumpet; and Phineas Niggelus called, in his high, reedy voice, \"And let it be noted that Slytherin House played its part! Let our contribution not be forgotten!\" But Harry had eyes only for the man who stood in the largest portrait directly behind the headmaster’s chair. Tears were sliding down from behind the half-moon spectacles into the long silver beard, and the pride and the gratitude emanating from him filled Harry wit h the same balm as phoenix song. At last, Harry held up his hands, and the portraits fell respectfully silent, beaming and mopping their eyes and waiting eagerly for him to speak. He directed his words at Dumbledore, however, and chose them with enormous care. Exhausted and bleary-eyed though he was, he must make one last effort, seeking one last piece of advice. \"The thing that was hidden in the Snitch,\" he began, \"I dropped it in the forest. I don’t exactly here, but I’m not going to go looking for it again. Do you agree?\" \"My dear boy, I do,\" said Dumbledore, while his fellow pictures looked confused and curious. \"A wise and courageous decision, but no less than I would have expected of you. Does anyone know else know where it fell?\" \"No one,\" said Harry, and Dumbledore nodded his satisfaction. \"I’m going to keep Ignotus’s present, though,\" said Harry, and Dumbledore beamed. \"But of course, Harry, it is yours forever, until you pass it on!\" \"And then there’s this.\" Harry held up the Elder Wand, and Ron and Hermione looked at it with a reverence that, even in his befuddled and sleep-deprived state, Harry did not like to see. \"I don’t want it.\" said Harry. \"What?\" said Ron loudly. \"Are you mental?\" \"I know it’s powerful,\" said Harry wearily. \"But I was happier with mine. So . . .\" He rummaged in the pouch hung around his neck, and pulled out the two halves of holly tstill just connected by the finest threat of phoenix feather. Hermione had said that they could not be repaired, that the damage was too severe. All he knew was that if this did not work, nothing would. He laid the broken wand upon the headmaster’s desk, touched it with the very tip of the Elder Wand, and said, \"Reparo.\" As his wand resealed, red sparks flew out of its end. Harry knew that he had succeeded. He picked up the holly and phoenix wand and felt a sudden warmth in his fingers, as though wand and hand were rejoicing at their reunion. \"I’m putting the Elder Wand,\" he told Dumbledore, who was watching him with enormous affection and admiration, \"back where it came from. It can stay there. If I die a natural death like Ignotus, its power will be broken, won’t it? The previous master will never have been defeated. That’ll be the end of it. Dumbledore nodded. They smiled at each other. \"Are you sure?\" said Ron. There was the faintest trace of longing in his voice as he looked at the Elder Wand. \"I think Harry’s right,\" said Hermione quietly. \"That wand’s more trouble than it’s worth.\" said Harry. \"And quite honestly,\" he turned away from the painted portraits, thinking now only of the four-poster bed lying waiting for him in Gryffindor Tower, and wondering whether Kreacher might bring him a sandwich there, \"I’ve had enough trouble for a lifetime.\" Epilogue Nineteen Years Later Autumn seemed to arrive suddenly that year. The morning of the first of September was crisp as an apple, and as the little family bobbed across the rumbling road toward the great sooty station, the fumes of car exhausts and the breath of pedestrians sparkled like cobwebs in the cold air. Two large cages tattled on top of the laden trolleys the parents were pushing; the owls inside them hooted indignantly, and the redheaded girl trailed fearfully behind here brothers, clutching her father's arm. \"It won't be long, and you'll be going too,\" Harry told her. \"Two years,\" sniffed Lily. \"I want to go now!\" The commuters stared curiously at the owls as the family wove its way toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten, Albus's voice drifted back to Harry over the surrounding clamor; his sons had resumed the argument they had started in the car. \"I won't! I won't be a Slytherin!\" \"James, give it a rest!\" said Ginny. \"I only said he might be,\" said James, grinning at his younger brother. \"There's nothing wrong with that. He might be in Slytherin\" But James caught his mother's eye and fell silent. The five Potters approached the barrier. With a slightly cocky look over his shoulder at his younger brother, James took the trolley from his mother and broke into a run. A moment later, he had vanished. \"You'll write to me, won't you?\" Albus asked his parents immediately, capitalizing on the momentary absence of his brother. \"Every day, of you want us to,\" said Ginny. \"Not every day,\" said Albus quickly, \"James says most people only get letters from home about once a month.\" \"We wrote to James three times a week last year,\" said Ginny. \"And you don't want to believe everything he tells you about Hogwarts,\" Harry put in. \"He likes a laugh, your brother.\" Side by side, they pushed the second trolley forward, gathering speed. As they reached the barrier, Albus winced, but no collision came. Instead, the family emerged onto platform nine and three-quarters, which was obscured by thick white steam that was pouring from the scarlet Hogwarts Express. Indistinct figures were swarming through the mist, into which James had already disappeared. \"Where are they?\" asked Albus anxiously, peering at the hazy forms they passed as they made their way down the platform. \"We'll find them,\" said Ginny reassuringly. But the vapor was dense, and it was difficult to make out anybody's faces. Detached from their owners, voices sounded unnaturally loud, Harry thought he head Percy discoursing loudly on broomstick regulations, and was quite glad of the excuse not to stop and say hello. . . . \"I think that's them, Al,\" said Ginny suddenly. A group of four people emerged from the mist, standing alongside the very last carriage. Their faces only came into focus when Harry, Ginny, Lily, and Albus had drawn right up to them. \"Hi,\" said Albus, sounding immensely relieved. Roses, who was already wearing her brand-new Hogwarts robes, beamed at him. \"Parked all right, then?\" Ron asked Harry. \"I did. Hermione didn't believe I could pass a Muggle driving test, did you? She thought I'd have to Confound the examiner.\" \"No, I didn't,\" said Hermione, \"I had complete faith in you.\" \"As a matter of fact, I did Confund him,\" Ron whispered to Harry, as together they lifted Albus's trunk and owl onto the train. \"I only forgot to look in the wing mirror, and let's face it, I can use a Supersensory Charm for that.\" Back on the platform, they found Lily and Hugo, Rose's younger brother, having an animated discussion about which House they would be sorted into when they finally went to Hogwarts. \"If you're not in Gryffindor, we'll disinherit you,\" said Ron, \"but no pressure.\" \"Ron!\" Lily and Hugo laughed, but Albus and Rose looked solemn. \"He doesn't mean it,\" said Hermione and Ginny, but Ron was no longer paying attention. Catching Harry's eye, he nodded covertly to a point some fifty yards away. The steam had thinned for a moment, and three people stood in sharp relief against the shifting mist. \"Look who it is.\" Draco Malfoy was standing there with his wife and son, a dark coat buttoned up to his throat. His hair was receding somewhat, which emphasized the pointed chin. The new boy resembled Draco as much as Albus resembled Harry. Draco caught sight of Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny staring at him, nodded curtly, and turned away again. \"So that's little Scorpius,\" said Ron under his breath. \"Make sure you beat him in every test, Rosie. Thank God you inherited your mother's brains.\" \"Ron, for heaven's sake,\" said Hermione, half stern, half amused. \"Don't try to turn them against each other before they've even started school!\" \"You're right, sorry,\" said Ron, but unable to help himself, he added, \"Don't get too friendly with him, though, Rosie. Granddad Weasley would never forgive you if you married a pureblood.\" \"Hey!\" James had reappeared; he had divested himself of his trunk, owl, and trolley, and was evidently bursting with news. \"Teddy's back there,\" he said breathlessly, pointing back over his shoulder into the billowing clouds of steam. \"Just seen him! And guess what he's doing? Snogging Victoire!\" He gazed up at the adults, evidently disappointed by the lack of reaction. \"Our Teddy! Teddy Lupin! Snogging our Victoire! Our cousin! And I asked teddy what he was doing --\" \"You interrupted them?\" said Ginny. \"You are so like Ron --\" \"-- and he said he'd come to see her off! And then he told me to go away. He's snogging her!\" James added as though worried he had not made himself clear. \"Oh, it would be lovely if they got married!\" whispered Lily ecstatically. \"Teddy would really be part of the family then!\" \"He already comes round for dinner about four times a week,\" said Harry \"Why don't we just invite him to live with is and have done with it?\" \"Yeah!\" said James enthusiastically. \"I don't mind sharing with Al--Teddy could have my room!\" \"No,\" said Harry firmly, \"you and Al will share a room only when I want the house demolished.\" He checked the battered old watch that had once been Fabian Prewett's. \"It's nearly eleven, you'd better get on board.\" \"Don't forget to give Neville our love!\" Ginny told James as she hugged him. \"Mum! I can't give a professor love!\" \"But you know Neville--\" James rolled his eyes. \"Outside, yeah, but at school he's Professor Longbottom, isn't he? I can't walk into Herbology and give him love. . . .\" Shaking his head at his mother's foolishness, he vented his feelings by aiming a kick at Albus. \"See you later, Al. Watch out for the thestrals.\" \"I thought they were invisible? You said they were invisible!\" but James merely laughed, permitted his mother to kiss him, gave his father a fleeting hug, then leapt onto the rapidly filling train. They saw him wave, then sprint away up the corridor to find his friends. \"Thestrals are nothing to worry about,\" Harry told Albus. \"They're gentle things, there's nothing scare about them. Anyway, you won't be going up to school in the carriages, you'll be going in the boats.\" Ginny kissed Albus good-bye. \"See you at Christmas.\" \"Bye, Al,\" said Harry as his son hugged him. \"Don't forget Hagrid's invited you to tea next Friday. Don't mess with Peeves. Don't duel anyone till you're learned how. And don't let James wind you up.\" \"What if I'm in Slytherin?\" The whisper was for his father alone, and Harry knew that only the moment of departure could have forced Albus to reveal how great and sincere that fear was. Harry crouched down so that Albus's face was slightly above his own. Alone of Harry's three children, Albus had inherited Lily's eyes. \"Ablus Severus,\" Harry said quietly, so that nobody but Ginny could hear, and she was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to rose, who was now on the train, \"you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.\" \"But just say--\" \"--then Slytherin House will have gained an excellent student, won't it? It doesn't matter to us, Al. But if it matter to you, you'll be able to choose Gryffindor over Slytherin. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.\" \"Really?\" \"It did for me,\" said Harry. He had never told any of his children that before, and he saw the wonder in Albus's face when he said it. But how the doorsr were slamming all along the scarlet train, and the blurred outlines of parents swarming forward for final kisses, last-minute reminders, Albus jumped into the carriage and ginny closed the door behind him. Students were hanging from the windows nearest them. A great number of faces, both on the train and off, seemed to be turned toward Harry. \"Why are they all staring?\" demanded Albus as he and rose craned around to look at the other students. \"Don't let it worry you,\" said Ron. \"It's me, I'm extremely famous.\" Albus, Rose, Hugo, and Lily laughed. The train began to more, and Harry walked alongside it, watching his son's thin face, already ablaze with excitement. Harry kept smiling and waving, even though it was like a little bereavement, watching his son glide away from him. . . . The last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn air. The train rounded a corner. Harry's hand was still raised in farewell. \"He'll be alright,\" murmured Ginny. As Harry looked dat her, he lowered his hand absentmindedly and touched the lightning scar on his forehead. \"I know he will.\" The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well.\n",

            " The Seven Potters Harry ran back upstairs to his bedroom, arriving at the window just in time to see the Dursleys' car swinging out of the drive and off up the road. Dedalus’s top hat was visible between Aunt Petunia and Dudley in the backseat. The car turned right at the end of Privet Drive, its windows burned scarlet for a moment in the now setting sun, and then it was gone. Harry picked up Hedwig’s cage, his Firebolt, and his rucksack, gave his unnaturally tidy bedroom one last sweeping look, and then made his ungainly way back downstairs to the hall, where he deposited cage, broomstick, and bag near the foot of the stairs. The light was fading rapidly, the hall full of shadows in the evening light. It felt most strange to stand here in the silence and know that he was about to leave the house for the last time. Long ago, when he had been left alone while the Dursleys went out to enjoy themselves, the hours of solitude had been a rare treat. Pausing only to sneak something tasty from the fridge, he had rushed upstairs to play on Dudley’s computer, or put on the television and flicked through the channels to his heart’s content. It gave him an odd, empty feeling remembering those times; it was like remembering a younger brother whom he had lost. \"Don’t you want to take a last look at the place?\" he asked Hedwig, who was still sulking with her head under her wing. \"We’ll never be here again. Don’t you want to remember all the good times? I mean, look at this doormat. What memories ... Dudley sobbed on it after I saved him from the dementors ... Turns out he was grateful after all, can you believe it? ... And last summer, Dumbledore walked through that front door ... \" Harry lost the thread of his thoughts for a moment and Hedwig did nothing to help him retrieve it, but continued to sit with her head under her wing. Harry turned his back on the front door. \"And under here, Hedwig\" - Harry pulled open a door under the stairs - \"is where I used to sleep! You never knew me then - Blimey, it’s small, I’d forgotten ... \" Harry looked around at the stacked shoes and umbrellas remembering how he used to wake every morning looking up at the underside of the staircase, which was more often than not adorned with a spider or two. Those had been the days before he had known anything about his true identity; before he had found out how his parents had died or why such strange things often happened around him. But Harry could still remember the dreams that had dogged him, even in those days: confused dreams involving flashes of green light and once - Uncle Vernon had nearly crashed the car when Harry had recounted it - a flying motorbike ... There was a sudden, deafening roar from somewhere nearby. Harry straightened up with a jerk and smacked the top of his head on the low door frame. Pausing only to employ a few of Uncle Vernon’s choicest swear words, he staggered back into the kitchen, clutching his head and staring out of the window into the back garden. The darkness seemed to be rippling, the air itself quivering. Then, one by one, figures began to pop into sight as their Disillusionment Charms lifted. Dominating the scene was Hagrid, wearing a helmet and goggles and sitting astride an enormous motorbike with a black sidecar attached. All around him other people were dismounting from brooms and, in two cases, skeletal, black winged horses. Wrenching open the back door, Harry hurtled into their midst. There was a general cry of greeting as Hermione flung her arms around him, Ron clapped him on the back, and Hagrid said, \"All righ’, Harry? Ready fer the off?\" \"Definitely,\" said Harry, beaming around at them all. \"But I wasn’t expecting this many of you!\" \"Change of plan,\" growled Mad-Eye, who was holding two enormous bulging sacks, and whose magical eye was spinning from darkening sky to house to garden with dizzying rapidity. \"Let’s get undercover before we talk you through it.\" Harry led them all back into the kitchen where, laughing and chattering, they settled on chairs, sat themselves upon Aunt Petunia’s gleaming work surfaces, or leaned up against her spotless appliances; Ron, long and lanky; Hermione, her bushy hair tied back in a long plait; Fred and George, grinning identically; Bill, badly scarred and long-haired; Mr. Weasley, kind-faced, balding, his spectacles a little awry; Mad-Eye, battle-worn, one-legged, his bright blue magical eye whizzing in its socket; Tonks, whose short hair was her favorite shade of bright pink; Lupin, grayer, more lined; Fleur, slender and beautiful, with her long silvery blonde hair; Kingsley, bald and broad-shouldered; Hagrid, with his wild hair and beard, standing hunchbacked to avoid hitting his head on the ceiling; and Mundungus Fletcher, small, dirty, and hangdog, with his droopy beady hound’s eyes and matted hair. Harry’s heart seemed to expand and glow at the sight: He felt incredibly fond of all of them, even Mundungus, whom he had tried to strangle the last time they had met. \"Kingsley, I thought you were looking after the Muggle Prime Minister?\" he called across the room. \"He can get along without me for one night,\" said Kingsley, \"You’re more important.\" \"Harry, guess what?\" said Tonks from her perch on top of the washing machine, and she wiggled her left hand at him; a ring glistened there. \"You got married?\" Harry yelped, looking from her to Lupin. \"I’m sorry you couldn’t be there, Harry, it was very quiet.\" \"That’s brilliant, congrat -\" \"All right, all right, we’ll have time for a cozy catch-up later,\" roared Moody over the hubbub, and silence fell in the kitchen. Moody dropped his sacks at his feet and turned to Harry. \"As Dedalus probably told you, we had to abandon Plan A. Pius Thicknesse has gone over, which gives us a big problem. He’s made it an imprisonable offense to connect this house to the Floo Network, place a Portkey here, or Apparate in or out. All done in the name of your protection, to prevent You-Know-Who getting in at you. Absolutely pointless, seeing as your mother’s charm does that already. What he’s really done is to stop you getting out of here safely.\" \"Second problem: You’re underage, which means you’ve still got the Trace on you.\" \"I don’t -\" \"The Trace, the Trace!\" said Mad-Eye impatiently. \"The charm that detects magical activity around under-seventeens, the way the Ministry finds out about underage magic! If you, or anyone around you, casts a spell to get you out of here, Thicknesse is going to know about it, and so will the Death Eaters.\" \"We can’t wait for the Trace to break, because the moment you turn seventeen you’ll lose all the protection your mother gave you. In short, Pius Thicknesse thinks he’s got you cornered good and proper.\" Harry could not help but agree with the unknown Thicknesse. \"So what are we going to do?\" \"We’re going to use the only means of transport left to us, the only ones the Trace can’t detect, because we don’t need to cast spells to use them: brooms, thestrals, and Hagrid’s motorbike.\" Harry could see flaws in this plan; however, he held his tongue to give Mad-Eye the chance to address them. \"Now, your mother’s charm will only break under two conditions: when you come of age, or\" - Moody gestured around the pristine kitchen - \"you no longer call this place home. You and your aunt and uncle are going your separate ways tonight, in the full understanding that you’re never going to live together again, correct?\" Harry nodded. \"So this time, when you leave, there’ll be no going back, and the charm will break the moment you get outside its range. We’re choosing to break it early, because the alternative is waiting for You-Know-Who to come and seize you the moment you turn seventeen. \"The one thing we’ve got on our side is that You-Know-Who doesn’t know we’re moving you tonight. We’ve leaked a fake trail to the Ministry: They think you’re not leaving until the thirtieth. However, this is You-Know-Who we’re dealing with, so we can’t rely on him getting the date wrong; he’s bound to have a couple of Death Eaters patrolling the skies in this general area, just in case. So, we’ve given a dozen different houses every protection we can throw at them. They all look like they could be the place we’re going to hide you, they’ve all got some connection with the Order: my house, Kingsley’s place, Molly’s Auntie Muriel’s - you get the idea.\" \"Yeah,\" said Harry, not entirely truthfully, because he could still spot a gaping hole in the plan. \"You’ll be going to Tonks’s parents. Once you’re within the boundaries of the protective enchantments we’ve put on their house you’ll be able to use a Portkey to the Burrow. Any questions?\" \"Er - yes,\" said Harry. \"Maybe they won’t know which of the twelve secure houses I’m heading for at first, but won’t it be sort of obvious once\" - he performed a quick headcount - \"fourteen of us fly off toward Tonks’s parents?\" \"Ah,\" said Moody, \"I forgot to mention the key point. Fourteen of us won’t be flying to Tonks’s parents. There will be seven Harry Potters moving through the skies tonight, each of them with a companion, each pair heading for a different safe house.\" From inside his cloak Moody now withdrew a flask of what looked like mud. There was no need for him to say another word; Harry understood the rest of the plan immediately. \"No!\" he said loudly, his voice ringing through the kitchen. \"No way!\" \"I told them you’d take it like this,\" said Hermione with a hint of complacency. \"If you think I’m going to let six people risk their lives -- !\" \"-because it’s the first time for all of us,\" said Ron. \"This is different, pretending to be me -\" \"Well, none of us really fancy it, Harry,\" said Fred earnestly. \"Imagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as specky, scrawny gits forever.\" Harry did not smile. \"You can’t do it if I don’t cooperate, you need me to give you some hair.\" \"Well, that’s the plan scuppered,\" said George. \"Obviously there’s no chance at all of us getting a bit of your hair unless you cooperate.\" \"Yeah, thirteen of us against one bloke who’s not allowed to use magic; we’ve got no chance,\" said Fred. \"Funny,\" said Harry, \"really amusing.\" \"If it has to come to force, then it will,\" growled Moody, his magical eye now quivering a little in its socket as he glared at Harry. \"Everyone here’s overage, Potter, and they’re all prepared to take the risk.\" Mundungus shrugged and grimaced; the magical eye swerved sideways to glance at him out of the side of Moody’s head. \"Let’s have no more arguments. Time’s wearing on. I want a few of your hairs, boy, now.\" \"But this is mad, there’s no need -\" \"No need!\" snarled Moody. \"With You-Know-Who out there and half the Ministry on his side? Potter, if we’re lucky he’ll have swallowed the fake bait and he’ll be planning to ambush you on the thirtieth, but he’d be mad not to have a Death Eater or two keeping an eye out, it’s what I’d do. They might not be able to get at you or this house while your mother’s charm holds, but it’s about to break and they know the rough position of the place. Our only chance is to use decoys. Even You-Know-Who can’t split himself into seven.\" Harry caught Hermione’s eye and looked away at once. \"So, Potter - some of your hair, if you please.\" Harry glanced at Ron, who grimaced at him in a just-do-it sort of way. \"Now!\" barked Moody. With all of their eyes upon him, Harry reached up to the top of his head, grabbed a hank of hair, and pulled. \"Good,\" said Moody, limping forward as he pulled the stopper out of the flask of potion. \"Straight in here, if you please.\" Harry dropped the hair into the mudlike liquid. The moment it made contact with its surface, the potion began to froth and smoke, then, all at once, it turned a clear, bright gold. \"Ooh, you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle, Harry,\" said Hermione, before catching sight of Ron’s raised eyebrows, blushing slightly, and saying, \"Oh, you know what I mean - Goyle’s potion tasted like bogies.\" \"Right then, fake Potters line up over here, please,\" said Moody. Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Fleur lined up in front of Aunt Petunia’s gleaming sink. \"We’re one short,\" said Lupin. \"Here,\" said Hagrid gruffly, and he lifted Mundungus by the scruff of the neck and dropped him down beside Fleur, who wrinkled her nose pointedly and moved along to stand between Fred and George instead. \"I’m a soldier, I’d sooner be a protector,\" said Mundungus. \"Shut it,\" growled Moody. \"As I’ve already told you, you spineless worm, any Death Eaters we run into will be aiming to capture Potter, not kill him. Dumbledore always said You-Know-Who would want to finish Potter in person. It’ll be the protectors who have got the most to worry about, the Death Eaters’ll want to kill them.\" Mundungus did not look particularly reassured, but Moody was already pulling half a dozen eggcup-sized glasses from inside his cloak, which he handed out, before pouring a little Polyjuice Potion into each one. \"Altogether, then ... \" Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, Fleur, and Mundungus drank. All of them gasped and grimaced as the potion hit their throats; At once, their features began to bubble and distort like hot wax. Hermione and Mundungus were shooting upward; Ron, Fred, and George were shrinking; their hair was darkening, Hermione’s and Fleur’s appearing to shoot backward into their skulls. Moody, quite unconcerned, was now loosening the ties of the large sacks he had brought with him. When he straightened up again, there were six Harry Potters gasping and panting in front of him. Fred and George turned to each other and said together, \"Wow - we’re identical!\" \"I dunno, though, I think I’m still better-looking,\" said Fred, examining his reflection in the kettle. \"Bah,\" said Fleur, checking herself in the microwave door, \"Bill, don’t look at me - I’m ‘ideous.\" \"Those whose clothes are a bit roomy, I’ve got smaller here,\" said Moody, indicating the first sack, \"and vice versa. Don’t forget the glasses, there’s six pairs in the side pocket. And when you’re dressed, there’s luggage in the other sack.\" The real Harry thought that this might just be the most bizarre thing he had ever seen, and he had seen some extremely odd things. He watched as his six doppelgangers rummaged in the sacks, pulling out sets of clothes, putting on glasses, stuffing their own things away. He felt like asking them to show a little more respect for privacy as they all began stripping off with impunity, clearly more at ease with displaying his body than they would have been with their own. \"I knew Ginny was lying about that tattoo,\" said Ron, looking down at his bare chest. \"Harry, your eyesight really is awful,\" said Hermione, as she put on glasses. Once dressed, the fake Harrys took rucksacks and owl cages, each containing a stuffed snowy owl, from the second sack. \"Good,\" said Moody, as at last seven dressed, bespectacled, and luggage-laden Harrys faced him. \"The pairs will be as follows: Mundungus will be traveling with me, by broom -\" \"Why’m I with you?\" grunted the Harry nearest the back door. \"Because you’re the one that needs watching,\" growled Moody, and sure enough, his magical eye did not waver from Mundungus as he continued, \"Arthur and Fred -\" \"I’m George,\" said the twin at whom Moody was pointing. \"Can’t you even tell us apart when we’re Harry?\" \"Sorry, George -\" \"I’m only yanking your wand, I’m Fred really -\" \"Enough messing around!\" snarled Moody. \"The other one - George or Fred or whoever you are - you’re with Remus. Miss Delacour -\" \"I’m taking Fleur on a thestral,\" said Bill. \"She’s not that fond of brooms.\" Fleur walked over to stand beside him, giving him a soppy, slavish look that Harry hoped with all his heart would never appear on his face again. \"Miss Granger with Kingsley, again by thestral -\" Hermione looked reassured as she answered Kingsley’s smile; Harry knew that Hermione too lacked confidence on a broomstick. \"Which leaves you and me, Ron!\" said Tonks brightly, knocking over a mug tree as she waved at him. Ron did not look quite as pleased as Hermione. \"An’ you’re with me, Harry. That all righ’?\" said Hagrid, looking a little anxious. \"We’ll be on the bike, brooms an’ thestrals can’t take me weight, see. Not a lot o’ room on the seat with me on it, though, so you’ll be in the sidecar.\" \"That’s great,\" said Harry, not altogether truthfully. \"We think the Death Eaters will expect you to be on a broom,\" said Moody, who seemed to guess how Harry was feeling. \"Snape’s had plenty of time to tell them everything about you he’s never mentioned before, so if we do run into any Death Eaters, we’re betting they’ll choose one of the Potters who looks at home on a broomstick. All right then,\" he went on, tying up the sack with the fake Potters’ clothes in it and leading the way back to the door, \"I make it three minutes until we’re supposed to leave. No point locking the back door, it won’t keep the Death Eaters out when they come looking. Come on ...\" Harry hurried to gather his rucksack, Firebolt, and Hedwig’s cage and followed the group to the dark back garden. On every side broomsticks were leaping into hands; Hermione had already been helped up onto a great black thestral by Kingsley, Fleur onto the other by Bill. Hagrid was standing ready beside the motorbike, goggles on. \"Is this it? Is this Sirius’s bike?\" \"The very same,\" said Hagrid, beaming down at Harry. \"An’ the last time yeh was on it, Harry, I could fit yeh in one hand!\" Harry could not help but feel a little humiliated as he got into the sidecar. It placed him several feet below everybody else: Ron smirked at the sight of him sitting there like a child in a bumper car. Harry stuffed his rucksack and broomstick down by his feet and rammed Hedwig’s cage between his knees. He was extremely uncomfortable. \"Arthur’s done a bit o’ tinkerin’,\" said Hagrid, quite oblivious to Harry’s discomfort. He settled himself astride the motorcycle, which creaked slightly and sank inches into the ground. \"It’s got a few tricks up its sleeves now. Tha’ one was my idea.\" He pointed a thick finger at a purple button near the speedometer. \"Please be careful, Hagrid.\" said Mr. Weasley, who was standing beside them, holding his broomstick. \"I'm still not sure that was advisable and it's certainly only to be used in emergencies.\" \"All right, then.\" said Moody. \"Everyone ready, please. I want us all to leave at exactly the same time or the whole point of the diversion's lost.\" Everybody motioned their heads. \"Hold tight now, Ron,\" said Tonks, and Harry saw Ron throw a forcing, guilty look at Lupin before placing his hands on each side of her waist. Hagrid kicked the motorbike into life: It roared like a dragon, and the sidecar began to vibrate. \"Good luck, everyone,\" shouted Moody. \"See you all in about an hour at the Burrow. On the count of three. One ... two .. THREE.\" There was a great roar from the motorbike, and Harry felt the sidecar give a nasty lurch. He was rising through the air fast, his eyes watering slightly, hair whipped back off his face. Around him brooms were soaring upward too; the long black tail of a thestral flicked past. His legs, jammed into the sidecar by Hedwig’s cage and his rucksack, were already sore and starting to go numb. So great was his discomfort that he almost forgot to take a last glimpse of number four Privet Drive. By the time he looked over the edge of the sidecar he could no longer tell which one it was. And then, out of nowhere, out of nothing, they were surrounded. At least thirty hooded figures, suspended in midair, formed a vast circle in the middle of which the Order members had risen, oblivious - Screams, a blaze of green light on every side: Hagrid gave a yell and the motorbike rolled over. Harry lost any sense of where they were. Streetlights above him, yells around him, he was clinging to the sidecar for dear life. Hedwig's cage, the Firebolt, and his rucksack slipped from beneath his knees - \"No - HELP!\" The broomstick spun too, but he just managed to seize the strap of his rucksack and the top of the cage as the motorbike swung the right way up again. A second's relief, and then another burst of green light. The owl screeched and fell to the floor of the cage. \"No - NO!\" The motorbike zoomed forward; Harry glimpsed hooded Death Eaters scattering as Hagrid blasted through their circle. \"Hedwig - Hedwig -\" But the owl lay motionless and pathetic as a toy on the floor of her cage. He could not take it in, and his terror for the others was paramount. He glanced over his shoulder and saw a mass of people moving, flares of green light, two pairs of people on brooms soaring off into the distance, but he could not tell who they were - \"Hagrid, we've got to go back, we've got to go back!\" he yelled over the thunderous roar of the engine, pulling out his wand, ramming Hedwig's cage into the floor, refusing to believe that she was dead. \"Hagrid, TURN AROUND!\" \"My job's ter get you there safe, Harry!\" bellow Hagrid, and he opened the throttle. \"Stop - STOP!\" Harry shouted, but as he looked back again two jets of green light flew past his left ear: Four Death Eaters had broken away from the circle and were pursuing them, aiming for Hagrid's broad back. Hagrid swerved, but the Death Eaters were keeping up with the bike; more curses shot after them, and Harry had to sink low into the sidecar to avoid them. Wriggling around he cried, \"Stupefy!\" and a red bolt of light shot from his own wand, cleaving a gap between the four pursuing Death Eaters as they scattered to avoid it. \"Hold on, Harry, this'll do for 'em!\" roared Hagrid, and Harry looked up just in time to see Hagrid slamming a thick finger into a green button near the fuel gauge. A wall, a solid black wall, erupted out of the exhaust pipe. Craning his neck, Harry saw it expand into being in midair. Three of the Death Eaters swerved and avoided it, but the fourth was not so lucky; He vanished from view and then dropped like a boulder from behind it, his broomstick broken into pieces. One of his fellows slowed up to save him, but they and the airborne wall were swallowed by darkness as Hagrid leaned low over the handlebars and sped up. More Killing Curses flew past Harry's head from the two remaining Death Eaters' wands; they were aiming for Hagrid. Harry responded with further Stunning Spells: Red and green collided in midair in a shower of multicolored sparks, and Harry thought wildly of fireworks, and the Muggles below who would have no idea what was happening - \"Here we go again, Harry, hold on!\" yelled Hagrid, and he jabbed at a second button. This time a great net burst from the bike's exhaust, but the Death Eaters were ready for it. Not only did they swerve to avoid it, but the companion who had slowed to save their unconscious friend had caught up. He bloomed suddenly out of the darkness and now three of them were pursuing the motorbike, all shooting curses after it. \"This'll do it, Harry, hold on tight!\" yelled Hagrid, and Harry saw him slam his whole hand onto the purple button beside the speedometer. With an unmistakable bellowing roar, dragon fire burst from the exhaust, white-hot and blue, and the motorbike shot forward like a bullet with a sound of wrenching metal. Harry saw the Death Eaters swerve out of sight to avoid the deadly trail of flame, and at the same time felt the sidecar sway ominously: Its metal connections to the bike had splintered with the force of acceleration. \"It's all righ', Harry!\" bellowed Hagrid, now thrown flat onto the back by the surge of speed; nobody was steering now, and the sidecar was starting to twist violently in the bike's slipstream. \"I'm on it, Harry, don' worry!\" Hagrid yelled, and from inside his jacket pocket he pulled his flowery pink umbrella. \"Hagrid! No! Let me!\" \"REPARO!\" There was a deafening bang and the sidecar broke away from the bike completely. Harry sped forward, propelled by the impetus of the bike's flight, then the sidecar began to lose height - In desperation Harry pointed his wand at the sidecar and shouted, \"Wingardium Leviosa!\" The sidecar rose like a cork, unsteerable but at least still airborne. He had but a split second's relief, however, as more curses streaked past him: The three Death Eaters were closing in. \"I'm comin', Harry!\" Hagrid yelled from out of the darkness, but Harry could feel the sidecar beginning to sink again: Crouching as low as he could, he pointed at the middle of the oncoming figures and yelled, \"Impedimenta!\" The jinx hit the middle Death Eater in the chest; For a moment the man was absurdly spread-eagled in midair as though he had hit an invisible barrier: One of his fellows almost collided with him - Then the sidecar began to fall in earnest, and the remaining Death Eater shot a curse so close to Harry that he had to duck below the rim of the car, knocking out a tooth on the edge of his seat - \"I'm comin', Harry, I'm comin'!\" A huge hand seized the back of Harry's robes and hoisted him out of the plummeting sidecar; Harry pulled his rucksack with him as he dragged himself onto the motorbike's seat and found himself back-to-back with Hagrid. As they soared upward, away from the two remaining Death Eaters, Harry spat blood out of his mouth, pointed his wand at the falling sidecar, and yelled, \"Confringo!\" He knew a dreadful, gut-wrenching pang for Hedwig as it exploded; the Death Eater nearest it was blasted off his broom and fell from sight; his companion fell back and vanished. \"Harry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,\" moaned Hagrid, \"I shouldn'ta tried ter repair it meself - yeh've got no room -\" \"It's not a problem, just keep flying!\" Harry shouted back, as two more Death Eaters emerged out of the darkness, drawing closer. As the curses came shooting across the intervening space again, Hagrid swerved and zigzagged: Harry knew that Hagrid did not dare use the dragon-fire button again, with Harry seated so insecurely. Harry sent Stunning Spell after Stunning Spell back at their pursuers, barely holding them off. He shot another blocking jinx at them: The closest Death Eater swerved to avoid it and his hood slipped, and by the red light of his next Stunning Spell, Harry saw the strangely blank face of Stanley Shunpike - Stan - \"Expelliarmus!\" Harry yelled. \"That's him, it's him, it's the real one!\" The hooded Death Eater's shout reached Harry even above the thunder of the motorbike's engine: Next moment, both pursuers had fallen back and disappeared from view. \"Harry, what's happened?\" bellowed Hagrid. \"Where've they gone?\" \"I don't know!\" But Harry was afraid: The hooded Death Eater had shouted, \"It's the real one!\"; how had he known? He gazed around at the apparently empty darkness and felt its menace. Where were they? He clambered around on the seat to face forward and seized hold of the back of Hagrid's jacket. \"Hagrid, do the dragon-fire thing again, let's get out of here!\" \"Hold on tight, then, Harry!\" There was a deafening, screeching roar again and the white-blue fire shot from the exhaust: Harry felt himself slipping backwards off what little of the seat he had. Hagrid flung backward upon him, barely maintaining his grip on the handlebars - \"I think we've lost 'em Harry, I think we've done it!\" yelled Hagrid. But Harry was not convinced; Fear lapped at him as he looked left and right for pursuers he was sure would come. . . . Why had they fallen back? One of them had still had a wand. . . . It's him. . . it's the real one. . . . They had said it right after he had tried to Disarm Stan. . . . \"We're nearly there, Harry, we've nearly made it!\" shouted Hagrid. Harry felt the bike drop a little, though the lights down on the ground still seemed remote as stars. Then the scar on his forehead burned like fire: as a Death Eater appeared on either side of the bike, two Killing Curses missed Harry by millimeters, cast from behind - And then Harry saw him. Voldemort was flying like smoke on the wind, without broomstick or thestral to hold him, his snake-like face gleaming out of the blackness, his white fingers raising his wand again - Hagrid let out a bellow of fear and steered the motorbike into a vertical dive. Clinging on for dear life, Harry sent Stunning Spells flying at random into the whirling night. He saw a body fly past him and knew he had hit one of them, but then he heard a bang and saw sparks from the engine; the motorbike spiraled through the air, completely out of control - Green jets of light shot past them again. Harry had no idea which way was up, which down: His scar was still burning; he expected to die at any second. A hooded figure on a broomstick was feet from him, he saw it raise its arm - \"NO!\" With a shout of fury Hagrid launched himself off the bike at the Death Eater; to his horror, Harry saw both Hagrid and the Death Eater, falling out of sight, their combined weight too much for the broomstick - Barely gripping the plummeting bike with his knees, Harry heard Voldemort scream, \"Mine!\" It was over: He could not see or hear where Voldemort was; he glimpsed another Death Eater swooping out of the way and heard, \"Avada -\" As the pain from Harry's scar forced his eyes shut, his wand acted of its own accord. He felt it drag his hand around like some great magnet, saw a spurt of golden fire through his half-closed eyelids, heard a crack and a scream of fury. The remaining Death Eater yelled; Voldemort screamed, \"NO!\" Somehow, Harry found his nose an inch from the dragon-fire button. He punched it with his wand-free hand and the bike shot more flames into the air, hurtling straight toward the ground. \"Hagrid!\" Harry called, holding on to the bike for dear life. \"Hagrid - Accio Hagrid!\" The motorbike sped up, sucked towards the earth. Face level with the handlebars, Harry could see nothing but distant lights growing nearer and nearer: He was going to crash and there was nothing he could do about it. Behind him came another scream, \"Your wand, Selwyn, give me your wand!\" He felt Voldemort before he saw him. Looking sideways, he stared into the red eyes and was sure they would be the last thing he ever saw: Voldemort preparing to curse him once more - And then Voldemort vanished. Harry looked down and saw Hagrid spread-eagled on the ground below him. He pulled hard at the handlebars to avoid hitting him, groped for the brake, but with an earsplitting, ground trembling crash, he smashed into a muddy pond. \n",

            "-Two The Deathly Hallows Harry fell, panting, onto grass and scrambled up at once. They seemed to have landed in the corner of a field at dusk; Hermione was already running in a circle around them, waving her wand. \"Protego Totalum...Salvio Hexia...\" \"That treacherous old bleeder.\" Ron panted, emerging from beneath the Invisibility Cloak and throwing it to Harry. \"Hermione you’re a genius, a total genius. I can’t believe we got out of that.\" \"Cave Inimicum...Didn’t I say it was an Frumpent horn, didn’t I tell him? And now his house has been blown apart!\" \"Serves him right,\" said Ron, examining his torn jeans and the cuts to his legs, \"What’d you reckon they’ll do to him?\" \"Oh I hope they don’t kill him!\" groaned Hermione, \"That’s why I wanted the Death Eaters to get a glimpse of Harry before we left, so they knew Xenophilius hadn’t been lying!\" \"Why hide me though?\" asked Ron. \"You’re supposed to be in bed with spattergrolt, Ron! They’ve kidnapped Luna because her father supported Harry! What would happen to your family if they knew you’re with him?\" \"But what about your mum and dad?\" \"They’re in Australia,\" said Hermione, \"They should be all right. They don’t know anything.\" \"You’re a genius,\" Ron repeated, looking awed. Yeah, you are, Hermione,\" agreed Harry fervently. \"I don’t know what we’d do without you.\" She beamed, but became solemn at once. \"What about Luna?\" \"Well, if they’re telling the truth and she’s still Alive ---\" began Ron. \"Don’t say that, don’t say it!\" squealed Hermione. \"She must be alive, she must!\" \"Then she’ll be in Azkaban, I expect,\" said Ron. \"Whether she survives the place, though...Loads don’t...\" \"She will,\" said Harry. He could not bear to contemplate the alternative. \"She’s tough, Luna, much tougher than you’d think. She’s probably teaching all the inmates about Wrackspurts and Nargles.\" \"I hope you’re right,\" said Hermione. She passed a hand over her eyes. \"I’d feel so sorry for Xenophilius if ---\" \"---if he hadn’t just tried to sell us to the Death Eaters, yeah,\" said Ron. They put up the tent and retreated inside it, where Ron made them tea. After their narrow escape, the chilly, musty old place felt like home: safe, familiar, and friendly. \"Oh, why did we go there?\" groaned Hermione after a few minutes’ silence. \"Harry, you were right, it was Godric’s Hollow all over again, a complete waste of time! The Deathly Hallows...such rubbish...although actually,\" a sudden thought seemed to have struck her, \"he might have made it all up, mightn’t he? He probably doesn’t believe in the Deathly Hallows at all, he just wanted to keep us talking until the Death Eaters arrived!\" \"I don’t think so,\" said Ron. \"It’s a damn sight harder making stuff up when you’re under stress than you’d think. I found that out when the Snatchers caught me. It was much easier pretending to be Stan, because I knew a bit about him, than inventing a whole new person. Old Lovegood was under loads of pressure, trying to make sure we stayed put. I reckon he told us the truth, or what he thinks is the truth, just to keep us talking.\" \"Well, I don’t suppose it matters,\" sighed Hermione. \"Even if he was being honest, I never heard such a lot of nonsense in all my life.\" \"Hang on, though,\" said Ron. \"The Chamber of Secrets was supposed to be a myth, wasn’t it?\" \"But the Deathly Hallows can’t exist, Ron!\" \"You keep saying that, but one of them can,\" said Ron. \"Harry’s Invisibility Cloak ---\" \"The Tale of the Three Brothers’ is a story,\" said Hermione firmly. \"A story about how humans are frightened of death. If surviving was as simple as hiding under the Invisibility Cloak, we’d have everything we need already!\" \"I don’t know. We could do with an unbeatable wand,\" said Harry, turning the blackthorn wand he so disliked over in his fingers. \"There’s no such thing, Harry!\" \"You said there have been loads of wands --- the Deathstick and whatever they were called ---\" \"All right, even if you want to kid yourself the Elder Wand’s real, what about the Resurrection Stone?\" Her fingers sketched quotation marks around the name, and her tone dripped sarcasm. \"No magic can raise the dead, and that’s that!\" \"When my wand connected with You-Know-Who’s, it made my mum and dad appear...and Cedric...\" \"But they weren’t really back from the dead, were they?\" said Hermione. \"Those kind of ---of pale imitations aren’t the same as truly bringing someone back to life.\" \"But she, the girl in the tale, didn’t really come back, did she? The story says that once people are dead, they belong with the dead. But the second brother still got to see her and talk to her, didn’t he? He even lived with her for a while...\" He saw concern and something less easily definable in Hermione’s expression. Then, as she glanced at Ron, Harry realized that it was fear: He had scared her with his talk of living with dead people. \"So that Peverell bloke who’s buried in Godric’s Hollow,\" he said hastily, trying to sound robustly sane, \"you don’t know anything about him, then?\" \"No,\" she replied, looking relieved at the change of subject. \"I looked him up after I saw the mark on his grave; if he’d been anyone famous or done anything important, I’m sure he’d be in one of our books. The only place I’ve managed to find the name ‘Peverell’ Is Nature’s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. I borrowed it from Kreacher,\" she explained as Ron raised his eyebrows. \"It lists the pure-blood families that are now extinct in the male line. Apparently the Peverells were one of the earliest families to vanish.\" \"Extinct in the male line?\" repeated Ron. \"It means the name died out,\" said Hermione, \"centuries ago, in the case of the Peverells. They could still have descendents, though, they’d just be called something different.\" And then it came to Harry in one shining piece, the memory that had stirred at the sound of the name \"Peverell\": a filthy old man brandishing an ugly ring in the face of a Ministry official, and he cried aloud, \"Marvolo Gaunt!\" \"Sorry said Ron and Hermione together. \"Marvolo Gaunt! You-Know-Who’s grandfather! In the Pensieve! With Dumbledore! Marvolo Gaunt said he was descended from the Peverells!\" Ron and Hermione looked bewildered. \"The ring, the ring that became the Horcrux, Marvolo Gaunt said it had the Peverell coat of arms on it! I saw him waving it in the bloke from the Ministry’s face, he nearly shoved it up his nose!\" \"The Peverell coat of arms?\" said Hermione sharply. \"Could you see what it looked like?\" \"Not really,\" said Harry, trying to remember. \"There was nothing fancy on there, as far as I could see; maybe a few scratches. I only ever saw it really close up after it had been cracked open.\" Harry saw Hermione’s comprehension in the sudden widening of her eyes. Ron was looking from one to the other, astonished. \"Blimey...You reckon it was this sign again? The sign of the Hallows? \"Why not said Harry excitedly, \"Marvolo Gaunt was an ignorant old git who lived like a pig, all he cared about was his ancestry. If that ring had been passed down through the centuries, he might not have known what it really was. There were no books in that house, and trust me, he wasn’t the type to read fairy tales to his kids. He’d have loved to think the scratches on the stone were a coat of arms, because as far as he was concerned, having pure blood made you practically royal.\" \"Yes...and that’s all very interesting,\" said Hermione cautiously, \"but Harry, if you’re thinking what I think you’re think ---\" \"Well, why not? Why not? said Harry, abandoning caution. \"It was a stone, wasn’t it?\" He looked at Ron for support. \"What if it was the Resurrection Stone?\" Ron’s mouth fell open. \"Blimey --- but would it still work if Dumbledore broke --- ?\" \"Work? Work? Ron, it never worked! There’s no such thing as a Resurrection Stone!\" Hermione leapt to her feet, looking exasperated and angry. Harry you’re trying to fit everything into the Hallows story ---\" \"Fit everything in?\" he repeated. \"Hermione, it fits of its own accord! I know the sign of the Deathly Hallows was on that stone! Gaunt said he was descended from the Peverells!\" \"A minute ago you told us you never saw the mark on the stone properly!\" \"Where’d you reckon the ring is now?\" Ron asked Harry. \"What did Dumbledore do with it after he broke it open?\" \"But Harry’s imagination was racing ahead, far beyond Ron and Hermione’s... Three objects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make the possessor master of Death...Master...Conqueror...Vanquisher...The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death... And he saw himself, possessor of the Hallows, facing Voldemort, whose Horcruxes were no match...Neither can live while the other survives...Was this the answer? Hallows versus Horcruxes? Was there a way after all, to ensure that he was the one who triumphed? If he were the master of the Deathly Hallows, would he be safe? \"Harry?\" But he scarcely heard Hermione: He had pulled out his Invisibility Cloak and was running it through his fingers, the cloth supple as water, light as air. He had never seen anything to equal it in his nearly seven years in the Wizarding world. The Cloak was exactly what Xenophilius had described: A cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible, and endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable concealment, no matter what spells are cast at it... And then, with a gasp, he remembered- \"Dumbledore had my Cloak the night my parents died!\" His voice shook and he could feel the color in his face, but he did not care. \"My mum told Sirius that Dumbledore borrowed the Cloak! This is why! He wanted to examine it, because he thought it was the third Hallow! Ignotus Peverell is buried in Godric’s Hollow...\" Harry was walking blindly around the tent, feeling as though great new vistas of truth were opening all around him. \"He’s my ancestor. I’m descended from the third brother! It all makes sense!\" \"He felt armed in certainty, in his belief in the Hallows, as if the mere idea of possessing them was giving him protection, and he felt joyous as he turned back to the other two. \"Harry,\" said Hermione again, but he was busy undoing the pouch around his neck, his fingers shaking hard. \"Read it,\" he told her, pushing his mother’s letter into her hand. \"Read it! Dumbledore had the Cloak, Hermione! Why else would he want it? He didn’t need a Cloak, he could perform a Disillusionment Charm so powerful that he made himself completely invisible without one!\" Something fell to the floor and rolled, glittering, under a chair: He had dislodged the Snitch when he pulled out the letter. He stooped to pick it up, and then the newly tapped spring of fabulous discoveries threw him another gift, and shock and wonder erupted inside him so that he shouted out. \"IT’S IN HERE! He left me the ring - it’s in the Snitch!\" \"You --- you reckon?\" He could not understand why Ron looked taken aback. It was so obvious, so clear to Harry. Everything fit, everything...His Cloak was the third Hallow, and when he discovered how to open the Snitch he would have the second, and then all he needed to do was find the first Hallow, the Elder Wand, and then --- But it was as though a curtain fell on a lit stage: All his excitement, all his hope and happiness were extinguished at a stroke, and he stood alone in the darkness, and the glorious spell was broken. \"That’s what he’s after.\" The change in his voice made Ron and Hermione look even more scared. \"You-Know-Who’s after the Elder Wand.\" He turned his back on their strained, incredulous faces. He knew it was the truth. It all made sense, Voldemort was not seeking a new wand; he was seeking an old wand, a very old wand indeed. Harry walked to the entrance of the tent, forgetting about Ron and Hermione as he looked out into the night, thinking... Voldemort had been raised in a Muggle orphanage. Nobody could have told him The Tales of Beedle the Bard when he was a child, any more than Harry had heard them. Hardly any wizards believed in the Deathly Hallows. Was it likely that Voldemort knew about them? Harry gazed into the darkness...If Voldemort had known about the Deathly Hallows, surely he would have sought them, done anything to possess them: three objects that made the possessor master of Death? If he had known about the Deathly Hallows, he might not have needed Horcruxes in the first place. Didn’t the simple fact that he had taken a Hallow, and turned it into a Horcrux, demonstrate that he did not know this last great Wizarding secret? Which meant that Voldemort sought the Elder Wand without realizing its full power, without understanding that it was one of three...for the wand was the Hallow that could not be hidden, whose existence was best known...The bloody trail of the Elder Wand is splattered across the pages of Wizarding history... Harry watched the cloudy sky, curves of smoke-gray and silver sliding over the face of the white moon. He felt lightheaded with amazement at his discoveries. He turned back into the tent. It was a shock to see Ron and Hermione standing exactly where he had left them, Hermione still holding Lily’s letter, Ron at her side looking slightly anxious. Didn’t they realize how far they had traveled in the last few minutes? \"This is it?\" Harry said, trying to bring them inside the glow of his own astonished certainty, \"This explains everything. The Deathly Hallows are real and I’ve got one --- maybe two ---\" He held up the Snitch. \"--- and You-Know-Who’s chasing the third, but he doesn’t realize...he just thinks it’s a powerful wand ---\" \"Harry,\" said Hermione, moving across to him and handing him back Lily’s letter, \"I’m sorry, but I think you’ve got this wrong, all wrong.\" \"But don’t you see? It all fits ---\" \"Not, it doesn’t,\" she said. \"It doesn’t. Harry, you’re just getting carried away. Please,\" she said as she started to speak, \"please just answer me this: If the Deathly Hallows really existed, and Dumbledore knew about them, knew that the person who possessed all of them would be master of Death --- Harry, why wouldn’t he have told you? Why?\" He had his answer ready. \"But you said it, Hermione! You’ve got to find out about them for yourself! It’s a Quest!\" \"But I only said that to try and persuade you to come to the Lovegoods’!\" cried Hermione in exasperation. \"I didn’t really believe it!\" Harry took no notice. \"Dumbledore usually let me find out stuff for myself. He let me try my strength, take risks. This feels like the kind of thing he’d do.\" \"Harry, this isn’t a game, this isn’t practice! This is the real thing, and Dumbledore left you very clear instructions: Find and destroy the Horcruxes! That symbol doesn’t mean anything, forget the Deathly Hallows, we can’t afford to get sidetracked ---\" Harry was barely listening to her. He was turning the Snitch over and over in his hands, half expecting it to break open, to reveal the Resurrection Stone, to prove to Hermione that he was right, that the Deathly Hallows were real. She appealed to Ron. \"You don’t believe in this, do you?\" Harry looked up, Ron hesitated. \"I dunno...I mean...bits of it sort of fit together,\" said Ron awkwardly, \"But when you look at the whole thing...\" He took a deep breath. \"I think we’re supposed to get rid of Horcruxes, Harry. That’s what Dumbledore told us to do. Maybe...maybe we should forget about this Hallows business.\" \"Thank you, Ron,\" said Hermione. \"I’ll take first watch.\" And she strode past Harry and sat down in the tent entrance bringing the action to a fierce full stop. But Harry hardly slept that night. The idea of the Deathly Hallows had taken possession of him, and he could not rest while agitating thoughts whirled through his mind: the wand, the stone, and the Cloak, if he could just possess them all... I open at the close...But what was the close? Why couldn’t he have the stone now? If only he had the stone, he could ask Dumbledore these questions in person...and Harry murmured words to the Snitch in the darkness, trying everything, even Parseltongue, but the golden ball would not open... And the wand, the Elder Wand, where was that hidden? Where was Voldemort searching now? Harry wished his scar would burn and show him Voldemort’s thoughts, because for the first time ever, he and Voldemort were united in wanting the very same thing...Hermione would not like that idea, of course...But then, she did not believe....Xenophilius had been right, in a way...Limited, Narrow, Close-minded. The truth was that she was scared of the idea of the Deathly Hallows, especially of the Resurrection Stone...and Harry pressed his mouth again to the Snitch, kissing it, nearly swallowing it, but the cold medal did not yield... It was nearly dawn when he remembered Luna, alone in a cell in Azkaban, surrounded by dementors, and he suddenly felt ashamed of himself. He had forgotten all about her in his feverish contemplation of the Hallows. If only they could rescue her, but dementors in those numbers would be virtually unassailable. Now he came to think about it, he had not tried casting a Patronus with the blackthorn wand...He must try that in the morning... If only there was a way of getting a better wand... And desire for the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, unbeatable, invincible, swallowed him once more... They packed up the tent next morning and moved on through a dreary shower of rain. The downpour pursued them to the coast, where they pitched the tent that night, and persisted through the whole week, through sodden landscapes that Harry found bleak and depressing. He could think only of the Deathly Hallows. It was as though a flame had been lit inside him that nothing, not Hermione’s flat disbelief nor Ron’s persistent doubts, could extinguish. And yet the fiercer the longing for the Hallows burned inside him, the less joyful it made him. He blamed Ron and Hermione: Their determined indifference was as bad as the relentless rain for dampening his spirits, but neither could erode his certainty, which remained absolute. Harry’s belief in and longing for the Hallows consumed him so much that he felt isolated from the other two and their obsession with the Horcruxes. \"Obsession?\" said Hermione in a low fierce voice, when Harry was careless enough to use the word one evening, after Hermione had told him off for his lack of interest in locating more Horcruxes. \"We’re not the one with an obsession, Harry! We’re the ones trying to do what Dumbledore wanted us to do!\" But he was impervious to the veiled criticism. Dumbledore had left the sign of the Hallows for Hermione to decipher, and he had also, Harry remained convinced of it, left the Resurrection Stone hidden in the golden Snitch. Neither can live while the other survives...master of Death...Why didn’t Ron and Hermione understand? \"’The last enemy shall be destroyed is death,’\" Harry quoted calmly. \"I thought it was You-Know-Who we were supposed to be fighting?\" Hermione retorted, and Harry gave up on her. Even the mystery of the silver doe, which the other two insisted on discussing, seemed less important to Harry now, a vaguely interesting sideshow. The only other thing that mattered to him was that his scar had begun to prickle again, although he did all he could to hide this fact from the other two. He sought solitude whenever it happened, but was disappointed by what he saw. The visions he and Voldemort were sharing had changed in quality; they had become blurred, shifting as though they were moving in and out of focus. Harry was just able to make out the indistinct features of an object that looked like a skull, and something like a mountain that was more shadow than substance. Used to images sharp as reality, Harry was disconcerted by the change. He was worried that the connection between himself and Voldemort had been damaged, a connection that he both feared and, whatever he had told Hermione, prized. Somehow Harry connected these unsatisfying, vague images with the destruction of his wand, as if it was the blackthorn wand’s fault that he could no longer see into Voldemort’s mind as well as before. As the weeks crept on, Harry could not help but notice, even through his new self-absorption, that Ron seemed to be taking charge. Perhaps because he was determined to make up for having walked out on them, perhaps because Harry’s descent into listlessness galvanized his dormant leadership qualities, Ron was the one now encouraging and exhorting the other two into action. \"Three Horcruxes left,\" he kept saying. \"We need a plan of action, come on! Where haven’t we looked? Let’s go through it again. The orphanage...\" Diagon Alley, Hogwarts, the Riddle House, Borgin and Burkes, Albania, every place that they knew Tom Riddle had ever lived or worked, visited or murdered, Ron and Hermione raked over them again, Harry joining in only to stop Hermione pestering him. He would have been happy to sit alone in silence, trying to read Voldemort’s thoughts, to find out more about the Elder Wand, but Ron insisted on journeying to ever more unlikely places simply, Harry was aware, to keep them moving. \"You never know,\" was Ron’s constant refrain. \"Upper Flagley is a Wizarding village, he might’ve wanted to live there. Let’s go and have a poke around.\" These frequent forays into Wizarding territory brought them within occasional sight of Snatchers. \"Some of them are supposed to be as bad as Death Eaters,\" said Ron. \"The lot that got me were a bit pathetic, but Bill recons some of them are really dangerous. They said on Potterwatch ---\" \"On what?\" said Harry. \"Potterwatch, didn’t I tell you that’s what it was called? The program I keep trying to get on the radio, the only one that tells the truth about what’s going on! Nearly all of the programs are following You-Know-Who’s line, all except Potterwatch, I really want you to hear it, but it’s tricky tuning in...\" Ron spent evening after evening using his wand to beat out various rhythms on top of the wireless while the dials whirled. Occasionally they would catch snatches of advice on how to treat dragonpox, and once a few bars of \"A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love.\" While he taped, Ron continued to try to hit on the correct password, muttering strings of random words under his breath. \"They’re normally something to do with the Order,\" he told them. \"Bill had a real knack for guessing them. I’m bound to get one in the end...\" \"But not until March did luck favor Ron at last. Harry was sitting in the tent entrance, on guard duty, staring idly at a clump of grape hyacinths that had forced their way through the chilly ground, when Ron shouted excitedly from inside the tent. \"I’ve got it, I’ve got it! Password was ‘Albus’! Get in here, Harry.\" Roused for the first time in days from his contemplation of the Deathly Hallows, Harry hurried back inside the tent to find Ron and Hermione kneeling on the floor beside the little radio. Hermione, who had been polishing the sword of Gryffindor just for something to do, was sitting open-mouthed, staring at the tiny speaker, from which a most familiar voice was issuing. \"...apologize for our temporary absence from the airwaves, which was due to a number of house calls in our area by those charming Death Eaters.\" \"But that’s Lee Jordan!\" said Hermione. \"I know!\" beamed Ron. \"Cool, eh?\" \"...now found ourselves another secure location,\" Lee was saying, and I’m pleased to tell you that two of our regular contributors have joined me here this evening. Evening, boys!\" \"Hi.\" \"Evening, River.\" \"’River’\" that’s Lee,\" Ron explained. \"They’ve all got code names, but you can usually tell ---\" \"Shh!\" said Hermione. \"But before we hear from Royal and Romulus,\" Lee went on, \"let’s take a moment to report those deaths that the Wizarding Wireless Network News and Daily Prophet don’t think important enough to mention. It is with great regret that we inform our listeners of the murders of Ted Tonks and Dirk Cresswell.\" Harry felt a sick, swooping in his belly. He, Ron, and Hermione gazed at one another in horror. \"A goblin by the name of Gornuk was also killed. It is believed that Muggle-born Dean Thomas and a second goblin, both believed to have been traveling with Tonks, Cresswell, and Gornuk, may have escaped. If Dean is listening, or if anyone has any knowledge of his whereabouts, his parents and sisters are desperate for news. \"Meanwhile, in Gaddley, a Muggle family of five has been found dead in their home. Muggle authorities are attributing their deaths to a gas leak, but members of the Order of the Phoenix inform me that it was the Killing Curse --- more evidence, as if it were needed, of the fact that Muggle slaughter is becoming little more than a recreational sport under the new regime. \"Finally, we regret to inform our listeners that the remains of Bathilda Bagshot have been discovered in Godric’s Hollow. The evidence is that she died several months ago. The Order of the Phoenix informs us that her body showed unmistakable signs of injuries inflicted by Dark Magic. \"Listeners, I’d like to invite you now to join us in a minute’s silence in memory of Ted Tonks, Dirk Cresswell, Bathilda Bagshot, Gornuk, and the unnamed, but no less regretted, Muggles murdered by the Death Eaters.\" Silence fell, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione did not speak. Half of Harry yearned to hear more, half of him was afraid of what might come next. It was the first time he had felt fully connected to the outside world for a long time. \"Thank you,\" said Lee’s voice. \"And now we can return to regular contributor Royal, for an update on how the new Wizarding order is affecting the Muggle world.\" \"Thanks, River,\" said an unmistakable voice, deep, measured, reassuring. \"Kingsley!\" burst out Ron. \"We know!\" said Hermione, hushing him. \"Muggles remain ignorant of the source of their suffering as they continue to sustain heavy casualties,\" said Kingsley. \"However, we continue to hear truly inspirational stories of wizards and witches risking their own safety to protect Muggle friends and neighbors, often without the Muggles’ knowledge. I’d like to appeal to all our listeners to emulate their example, perhaps by casting a protective charm over any Muggle dwellings in your street. Many lives could be saved if such simple measures are taken.\" \"And what would you say, Royal, to those listeners who reply that in these dangerous times, it should be ‘Wizards first’? asked Lee. \"I’d say that it’s one short step from ‘Wizards first’ to ‘Purebloods first,’ and then to ‘Death Eaters,’\" replied Kingsley. \"We’re all human, aren’t we? Every human life is worth the same, and worth saving.\" \"Excellently put, Royal, and you’ve got my vote for Minister of Magic if we ever get out of this mess,\" said Lee. \"And now, over to Romulus for our popular feature ‘Pals of Potter.’\" \"Thanks, River,\" said another very familiar voice. Ron started to speak, but Hermione forestalled him in a whisper. \"We know it’s Lupin!\" \"Romulus, do you maintain, as you have every time you’ve appeared on our program, that Harry Potter is still alive?\" \"I do,\" said Lupin firmly. \"There is no doubt at all in my mind that his death would be proclaimed as widely as possible by the Death Eaters if it had happened, because it would strike a deadly blow at the morale of those resisting the new regime. ‘The Boy Who Lived’ remains a symbol of everything for which we are fighting: the triumph of good, the power of innocence, the need to keep resisting.\" A mixture of gratitude and shame welled up in Harry. Had Lupin forgiven him, then, for the terrible things he had said when they had last met? \"And what would you say to Harry if you knew he was listening, Romulus?\" \"I’d tell him we’re all with him in spirit,\" said Lupin, then hesitated slightly, \"And I’d tell him to follow his instincts, which are good and nearly always right.\" Harry looked at Hermione, whose eyes were full of tears. \"Nearly always right,\" she repeated. \"Oh, didn’t I tell you?\" said Ron in surprise. \"Bill told me Lupin’s living with Tonks again! And apparently she’s getting pretty big too...\" \"...and our usual update on those friends of Harry Potter’s who are suffering for their allegiance?\" Lee was saying. \"Well, as regular listeners will know, several of the more outspoken supporters of Harry Potter have now been imprisoned, including Xenophilius Lovegood, erstwhile editor of The Quibbler,\" said Lupin. \"At least he’s still alive!\" muttered Ron. \"We have also heard within the last few hours that Rubeus Hagrid\" - all three of them gasped, and so nearly missed the rest of the sentence -- \"well-known gamekeeper at Hogwarts School, has narrowly escaped arrest within the grounds of Hogwarts, where he is rumored to have hosted a ‘Support Harry Potter’ party in his house. However, Hagrid was not taken into custody, and is, we believe, on the run.\" \"I suppose it helps, when escaping from Death Eaters, if you’ve got a sixteen-foot-high half brother?\" asked Lee. \"It would tend to give you an edge,\" agreed Lupin gravely. \"May I just add that while we here at Potterwatch applaud Hagrid’s spirit, we would urge even the most devoted of Harry’s supporters against following Hagrid’s lead. ‘Support Harry Potter’ parties are unwise in the present climate.\" \"Indeed they are, Romulus,\" said Lee, \"so we suggest that you continue to show your devotion to the man with the lightning scar by listening to Potterwatch! And now let’s move to news concerning the wizard who is proving just as elusive as Harry Potter. We like to refer to him as the Chief Death Eater, and here to give his views on some of the more insane rumors circulating about him, I’d like to introduce a new correspondent. Rodent?\" \"’Rodent’?\" said yet another familiar voice, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione cried out together: \"Fred!\" \"No - is it George?\" \"It’s Fred, I think,\" said Ron, leaning in closer, as whichever twin it was said, \"I’m not being ‘Rodent,’ no way, I told you I wanted to be ‘Rapier’!\" \"Oh, all right then, ‘Rapier,’ could you please give us your take on the various stories we’ve been hearing about the Chief Death Eater?\" \"Yes, River, I can,\" said Fred. \"As our listeners will know, unless they’ve taken refuge at the bottom of a garden pond or somewhere similar, You-Know-Who’s strategy of remaining in the shadows is creating a nice little climate of panic. Mind you, if all the alleged sightings of him are genuine, we must have a good nineteen You-Know-Whos running around the place.\" \"Which suits him, of course,\" said Kingsley. \"The air of mystery is creating more terror than actually showing himself.\" \"Agreed,\" said Fred. \"So, people, let’s try and calm down a bit. Things are bad enough without inventing stuff as well. For instance, this new idea that You-Know-Who can kill people with a single glance from his eyes. That’s a basilisk, listeners. One simple test: Check whether the thing that’s glaring at you has got legs. If it has, it’s safe to look into its eyes, although if it really is You-Know-Who, that’s still likely to be the last thing you ever do.\" For the first time in weeks and weeks, Harry was laughing: He could feel the weight of tension leaving him. \"And the rumors that he keeps being sighted abroad?\" asked Lee. \"Well, who wouldn’t want a nice little holiday after all the hard work he’s been putting in?\" asked Fred. \"Point is, people, don’t get lulled into a false sense of security, thinking he’s out of the country. Maybe he is, maybe he isn’t, but the fact remains he can move faster than Severus Snape confronted with shampoo when he wants to, so don’t count on him being a long way away if you’re planning to take any risks. I never thought I’d hear myself say it, but safety first!\" \"Thank you very much for those wise words, Rapier,\" said Lee. \"Listeners, that brings us to the end of another Potterwatch. We don’t know when it will be possible to broadcast again, but you can be sure we shall be back. Keep twiddling those dials: The next password will be ‘Mad-Eye.’ Keep each other safe: Keep faith. Good night.\" The radio’s dial twirled and the lights behind the tuning panel went out. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were still beaming. Hearing familiar, friendly voices was an extraordinary tonic; Harry had become so used to their isolation he had nearly forgotten that other people were resisting Voldemort. It was like waking from a long sleep. \"Good, eh?\" said Ron happily. \"Brilliant,\" said Harry. \"It’s so brave of them,\" sighed Hermione admiringly. \"If they were found ...\" \"Well, they keep on the move, don’t they?\" said Ron. \"Like us.\" \"But did you hear what Fred said?\" asked Harry excitedly; now the broadcast was over, his thoughts turned around toward his all consuming obsession. \"He’s abroad! He’s still looking for the Wand, I knew it!\" \"Harry-\" \"Come on, Hermione, why are you so determined not to admit it? Vol -\" \"HARRY, NO!\" \"-demort’s after the Elder Wand!\" \"The name’s Taboo!\" Ron bellowed, leaping to his feet as a loud crack sounded outside the tent. \"I told you, Harry, I told you, we can’t say it anymore - we’ve got to put the protection back around us - quickly - it’s how they find -\" But Ron stopped talking, and Harry knew why. The Sneakoscope on the table had lit up and begun to spin; they could hear voices coming nearer and nearer: rough, excited voices. Ron pulled the Deluminator out of his pocket and clicked it: Their lamps went out. \"Come out of there with your hands up!\" came a rasping voice through the darkness. \"We know you’re in there! You’ve got half a dozen wands pointing at you and we don’t care who we curse!\" \n",

            "-Two The Elder Wand The world had ended, so why had the battle not ceased, the castle fallen silent in horror, and every combatant laid down their arms? Harry's mind was in free fall, spinning out of control, unable to grasp the impossibility, because Fred Weasley could not be dead, the evidence of all his senses must be lying-- And then a body fell past the hole blown into the side of the school and curses flew in at them from the darkness, hitting the wall behind their heads. \"Get down!\" Harry shouted, as more curses flew through the night: He and Ron had both grabbed Hermione and pulled her to the floor, but Percy lay across Fred's body, shielding it from further harrm, and when Harry shouted \"Percy, come on, we've got to move!\" he shook his head. \"Percy!\" Harry saw tear tracks streaking the grime coating ron's face as he sezied his elder brother's shoulders and pulled, but Percy would not budge. \"Percy, you can't do anything for him! We're going to--\" Hermione screamed, and Harry, turning, did not need to ask why. A monstrous spider the size of a small car was trying to climb through the huge hole in the wall. one of Aragog's descendants had joined the fight. Ron and Harry shouted together; their spells collided and the monster was blown backward, its legs jerking horribly, and vanished into the darkness. \"It brought friends!\" Harry called to the others, glancing over the edge of the castle through the hole in the wall the curses had blasted. More giant spiders were climbing the side of the building, liberated from the Forbidden Forest, into which the Death Eaters must have penetrated. Harry fired Stunning Spells down upon them, knocking the lead monster into its fellows, so that they rolled back down the building and out of sight. Then more curses came soaring over Harry's head, so close he felt the force of them blow his hair. \"Let's move, NOW!\" Pushing Hermione ahead of him with ron, Harry stooped to seize Fred's body under the armpit. Percy, realizing what Harry was trying to do, stopped clinging to the body and helped: together, crouching low to avoid the curses flying at them from the grounds, they hauled Fred out of the way. \"Here,\" said Harry, and they placed him in a niche where a suit of armor had stood earlier. He could not bear to look at Fred a second longer than he had to, and after making sure that the body was well- hidden, he took off after ron and Hermione. Malfoy and Goyle had vanished but at the end of the corridor, which was now full of dust and falling masonry, glass long gone from windows, he saw many people running backward and forward, whether friends or foes he could not tell. Rounding the corner, Percy let out a bull-like roar: \"ROOKWOOD!\" and sprinted off in the direction of a tall man, who was pursuing a couple of students. \"Harry, in here!\" Hermione screamed. She had pulled Ron behind a tapestry. They seemed to be wrestling together, and for one mad second Harry thought that they were embracing again; then hhe saw that Hermione was trying to restrain Ron, to stop him running after Percy. \"Listen to me--LISTEN RON!\" \"I wanna help--I wanna kill Death Eaters--\" His face was contorted, smeared with dust and smoke, and he was shaking with rage and grief. \"ron, we're the only ones who can end it! Please--ron--we need the snake, we've got to kill the snake!\" said Hermione. But Harry knew how Ron felt: Pursuing another Horcrux could not bring the satisfaction of revenge; he too wanted to fight, to punish them, the people who had killed Fred, and he wanted to find the other Weasleys, and above all make sure, make quite sure, that Ginny was not--but he could not permit that idea to form in his mind-- \"We will fight!\" Hermione said. \"We'll have to, to reach the snake! But let's not lose sight now of what we're supposed to be d-doing! We're the only ones who can end it!\" She was crying too, and she wiped her face on her torn and singed sleeve as she spoke, but she took great heaving breaths to calm herself as, still keeping a tight hold on ron, she turned to Harry. \"You need to find out where Voldemort is, because he'll have the snake with him, won't he? Do it, Harry--look inside him!\" Why was it so easy? Because his scar had been burning for hours, yearning to show him Voldemort's thoughts? He closed his eyes on her command, and at once, the screams and bangs and all the discordant sounds of the battle were drowned until they became distant, as though he stood far, far away from them... He was standing in the middle of a desolate but strangely familiar room, with peeling paper on the walls and all the windows boarded up except for one. The sounds of the assault on the castle were muffled and distant. The single unblocked window revealed distant bursts of light where the castle stood, but inside the room was dark except for a solitary oil lamp. He was rolling his wand between his figners, watching it, his thoughts on the room in the castle, the secret room only he had ever found, the room, like the chamber, that you had to be clever and cunning and inquisitive to discover...He was confident that the boy would not find the diadem...although Dumbledore's puppet had come much farther than he ever expected...too far... \"My Lord,\" said a voice, desperate and cracked. He turned: there was Lucius Malfoy sitting in the darkest corner, ragged and still bearing the marks of the punishment he had received after the boy's last escape. One of his eyes remained closed and puffy. \"My Lord...please...my son...\" \"If your son is dead, Lucius, it is not my fault. He did not come and join me, like the rest of the Slytherins. Perhaps he has decided to befriend Harry Potter?\" \"No--never,\" whispered Malfoy. \"You must hope not.\" \"Aren't--aren't you afraid, my Lord that Potter might die at another hand but yours?\" asked Malfoy, his voice shaking. \"Wouldn't it be...forgive me...more prudent to call off this battle, enter the castle, and seek him y-yourself?\" \"Do not pretend Lucius. You wish the battle to cease so that you can discover what has happened to your son. And i do not need to seek Potter. Before the night is out, Potter will have come to find me.\" Voldemort dropped his gaze once more to the wand in his fingers. It troubled him...and those things that troubled Lord Voldemort needed to be rearranged... \"Go and fetch Snape.\" \"Snape, m-my Lord?\" \"Snape. Now. I need him. There is a --service--I require from him. Go.\" Frightened, stumbling a little through the gloom, Lucius left the room. Vodlemort continued to stand there, twirling the wand between his fingers, staring at it. \"It is the only way, Nagini,\" he whispered, and he looked around, and there was the great thick snake, now suspended in midair, twisting gracefully within the enchanted, protected space he had made for her, a starry, transparent sphere somewhere between a glittering cage and a tank. With a gasp, Harry pulled back and opened his yees at the same moment his ears were assaulted with the screeches and cries, the smashes and bangs of battle. \"He's in the Shrieking Shack. The snake's with him, it's got some sort of magical protection around it. He's just sent Lucius Malfoy to find Snape.\" \"voldemort's sitting in the shrieking Shack?\" said Hermione, outraged. \"He's not--he's not even FIGHTING?\" \"He doesn't think he needs to fight,\" said Harry. \"He thinks I'm going to go to him.\" \"But why?\" \"He knows I'm after Horcruxes--he's keeping Nagini close beside him- -obviously I'm going to have to go to him to get near the thing--\" \"Right,\" said Ron, squaring his shoulders. \"So you can't go, that's what he wants, what he's expecting. You stay here and look after Hermione, and I'll go and get it--\" Harry cut across Ron. \"You two stay here, I'll go under the Cloak and I'll be back as soon as I--\" \"No,\" said Hermione,, \"it makes much more sense if I take the Cloak and--\" \"Don't even think about it,\" Ron snarled at her. before Hermione could get farther than \"Ron, I'm just as capable -- \" the tapestry at the top of the staircase on which they stood was ripped open. \"POTTER!\" Two masked Death Eaters stood there, but even before their wands were fully raised, Hermione shouted \"Glisseo!\" The stairs beneath their feet flatteneed into a chute and she, Harry, and Ron hurtled down it, unable to control their speed but so fast that the Death Eaters' Stunning Spells flew far over their heads. They shot through the concealing tapestry at the bottom and spun onto the floor, hitting the opposite wall. \"Duro!\" cried Hermione, pointing her wand at the tapestry, and there were two loud, sickening crunches as the tapestry turned to stone and the Death Eaters pursuing them crumpled against it. \"Get back!\" shouted Ron, and he, Harry, and Hermione hurled themselves against a door as a herd of galloping desks thundered past, shepherdd by a sprinting Professor McGonagall. She appeared not to notice them. Her hair had come down and there was a gash on her cheek. As she turned the corner, they heard her scream, \"CHARGE!\" \"Harry, you get the Cloak on,\" said Hermione. \"Never mind us--\" But he threw it over all three of them; large though they were he doubted anyone would see their disembodied feet through the dust that clogged the air, the falling stone, the shimmer of spells. they ran down the next staircase and found themselves in a corridor full of duelers. The portraits on either side of the fighters were crammed with figures screaming advice and encouragement, while Death Eaters, both masked and unmasked, dueled students and teachers. Dean had won himself a wand, for he was face-to-face with Dolohov, Parvati with Travers. Harry, ron and Hermione raised their wands at once, ready to strike, but the duelers were weaving and darting so much that there was a strong likelihood of hurting on of their own side if they cast curses. Even as they stood braced, looking for the opportunity to act, there came a great \"Wheeeeee!\" and looking up, Harry saw Peeves zoomign over them, dropping Snargaluff pods down onto the Death Eaters, whose heads were suddenly engulfed in wriggling green tubers like fat worms. \"ARGH!\" A fistful of tubers had hit the Cloak over Ron's head; the damp green roots were suspended improbably in midair as Ron tried to shake them loose. \"Someone's invisible there!\" shouted a masked Death Eater, pointing. Dean made the most of the Death Eater's momentary distraction, knocking him out with a stunning Spell; Dolohov attempted to retaliate, and Parvati shot a Body Bind Curse at him. \"LET'S GO!\" Harry yelled, and he, Ron, and Hermione gathered the Cloak tightly around themselves and pelted, heads down, through the midst of the fighters, slipping a little in pools of Snargaluff juice, toward the top of the marble staircase into the entrance hall. \"I'm Draco Malfoy, I'm Draco, I'm on your side!\" Draco was on the upper landing, pleading with anoter masked Death Eater. Harry Stunned the Death Eater as they passed. Malfoy looked around, beaming, for his savior, and Ron punched him from under the Cloak. Malfoy fell backward on top of the Death Eater, his mouth bleeding, utterly bemused. \"And that's the second time we've saved your life tonight, you two- faced bastard!\" Ron yelled. There were more duelers all over the stairs and in the hall. Death Eaters everywhere Harry looked: Yaxley, close to the front doors, in combat with Flitwick, a masked Death Eater dueling Kingsley right beside them. Students ran in every direction; some carrying or dragging injured friends. Harry directed a Stunnning Spell toward the masked Death Eater; it missed but nearly hit Neville, who had emerged from nowhere brandishing armfuls of Venomous Tentacula, which looped itself happily around the nearest Death Eater and began reeling him in. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sped won the marble staircase: glass shattered on the left, and the Slytherin hourglass that had recorded House points spilled its emeralds everywhere, so that people slipped and staggered as they ran. Two bodies fell from the balcony overhead as they reached the ground a gray blur that Harry took for an animal sped four-legged across the hall to sink its teeth into one of the fallen. \"NO!\" shrieked Hermione, and with a deafening blast from her wand, Fenrir Greyback was thrown backward from the feebly struggling body of Lavender Brown. He hit the marble banisters and struggled to return to his feet. Then, with a bright white flash and a crack, a crystal ball fell on top of his head, and he crumpled to the ground and did not move. \"I have more!\" shrieked Professor Trelawney from over the banisters. \"More for any who want them! Here--\" And with a move likea tennis serve, she heaved another enormous crystal sphere from her bag, waved her wand through the air, and caused the ball to speed across the hall and smash through a window. At the same moment, the heavy wooden front doors burst open, and more of the gigantic spiders forced their way into the front hall. Screams of terror rent the air: the fighters scattered, Death Eaters and Hogwartians alike, and red and green jets of light flew into the midst of the oncoming monsters, which shuddered and reared, more terrifying than ever. \"How do we get out?\" yelled ron over all the screaming, but before either Harry or Hermione could answer they were bowled aside; Hagrid had come thundering down the stairs, brandishing his flowery pink umbrella. \"Don't hurt 'em, don't hurt 'em!\" he yelled. \"HAGRID, NO!\" Harry forgot everything else: he sprinted out from under the cloak, running bent double to avoid the curses illuminating the whole hall. \"HAGRID, COME BACK!\" But he was not even halfway to Hagrid when he saw it happen: Hagrid vanished amongst the spiders, and with a great scurrying, a foul swarming movement, they retreated under the onslaught of spells, Hagrid buried in their midst. \"HAGRID!\" Harry heard someone calling his own name, whether friend or foe he did not care: He was springint down the front steps into the dark grounds, and the spiders were swarming away with their prey, and he could see nothing of Hagrid at all. \"HAGRID!\" He thought he could make out an enormous arm waving from the mdist of the spider swarm, but as he made to chase after them, his way was impeded by a monumental foot, which swung down out of the darkness and made the ground on which he stood shudder. He looked up: A giant stood before him, twenty feet high, its head ihidden in shadow, nothing but its treelike, hairy shins illuminated by light from the castle doors. With one brutal, fluid movement, it smashed a massive fist through an upper window, and glass rained down upon Harryk, forcing him back under the shelter of the doorway. \"Oh my--!\" shrieked Hermione, as she and ron caught up with Harry and gazed upward at the giant now trying to seize people through the window above. \"DON'T!\" ron yelled, grabbing Hermione's hand as she raised her wand. \"Stun him and he'll crush half the castle--\" \"HAGGER?\" Grawp came lurching around the corner of the castle; only dnow did Harry realzie that Grawp was, indeed, an undersized giant. The gargantuan monster trying to crush people on the upper floors turned around and let out a rorar. The stone steps tremebled as he stomped toward his smaller kin, and Grawp's lopsided mouth fell open, showing yellow, half brick-sized teeth; and then they launched themselves at each other with the savagery of lions. \"RUN!\" Harry roared; the ngiht was full of hideous yells and blows as the giants wrestled, and he seized Hermione's hand and tore down the steps into the grounds, Ron bringing up the rear. Harry had not lost hope of finding and saving Hagrid; he ran so fast that they were halfway toward the forest before they were brought up short again. The air around them had frozen: Harry's breath caught and solidified in his chest. Shapes moved out in the darkness, swirling figures of concentrated blackness, moving in a great wave towards the castles, their faces hooded and their breath rattling... ron and Hermione closed in beside him as the sounds of fighting behind them grew suddenly muted, deadened, because a silence only dementors could bring was falling thickly through the night, and Fred was gone, and Hagrid was suurely dying or already dead... \"come on, Harry!\" said Hermione's voice from a very long way away. \"Patronuses, Harry, come on!\" he raised his wand, but a dull hopelessness was spreading throughout him: How many more lay dead that he did not yet know about? He felt as though his soul had already half left his body.... \"HARRY, COME ON!\" screamed Hermione. A hundred dementors were advancing, gliding toward them, sucking their way closer to Harry's despair, which was like a promise of a feast... He saw Ron's silver terrier burst into the air, flicker feebly, and expire; he saw Hermione's otter twist in midair and fade, and his own wand trembled in his hand, and he almost welcomed the oncoming oblivion, the promise of nothing, of no feeling... And then a silver hare, a boar, and fox soared past Harry, Ron, and Hermione's heads: the dementors fell back before the creatures' approach. Three more people had arrived out of the darkness to stand beside them, their wands outstretched, continuing to cast Patronuses: Luna, Ernie, and Seamus. \"That's right,\" said Luna encouragingly, as if they were back in the Room of Requirement and this was simply spell practice for the D.A., \"That's right, Harry...come on think of something happy...\" 'something happy?\" he said, his voice cracked. \"We're all still here,\" she whispered, \"we;re still fighting. Come on, now....\" There was a silver spark, then a wavering light, and then, with the greatest effort it had ever cost him the stag burst from the end of Harry's wand. It cantered forward, and now the dementors scattered in earnest, and immediately the night was mild again, but the sounds of the surrounding battle were loud in his ears. \"Can't thank you enough,\" said ron shakily, turning to Luna, Ernie, and Seamus \"you just saved--\" With a roar and an earth-quaking tremor, another giant came lurching out of the darkness from the direction of the forest, brandishing a club taller than any of them. \"RUN!\" Harry shouted again, but the others needed no telling; They all scattered, and not a second too soon, for the next moment the creature's vast foot had fallen exactly where they had been standing. Harry looked round: ron and Hermione were following him, but the other three had vanished back into the battle. \"Let's get out of range!\" yelled Ron as the giant swung its club again and its bellows echoed through the night, across the grounds wehere bursts of red and green light continued to illuminate the darkness. \"The Whomping willow,\" said Harry, \"go!\" Somehow he walled it all up in his mind, crammed it into a small space into which he could not look now: thoughts of Fred and Hagrid, and his terror for all the people he loved, scattered in and outside the castle, must all wait, because they had to run, had to reach the snake and Voldemort, because that was, as Hermione said, the only way to end it-- He sprinted, half-believing he could outdistance death itself, ignoring the jets of light flying in the darkness all around him, and the sound of hte lake crashing like the sea, and the creaking of the Forbidden Forest though the night was windless; through grounds that seemed themselves to have risen in rebellion, he ran faster than he had ever moved in his life, and it was he who saw the great tree first, the Willow that protected the secret at its roots with whiplike, slashing branches. Panting and gasping, Harry slowed down, skirting the willow's swiping branches, peering through the darkness toward its tick trunk, trying to see the single knot in the bark of the old tree that would paralyze it. Ron and Hermione caught up, Hermione so out of breath that she could not speak. \"How--how're we going to get in?\" panted ron. \"I can--see the palce- -if we jsut had--Crookshanks again--\" \"Crookshanks?\" wheezed Hermione, bent double, clutching her chest. \"Are you a wizard, or what?\" \"Oh--right--yeah--\" Ron looked around, then directed his wand at a twig on the ground and said \"Winguardium Leviosa!\" The twig flew up from the gruond, spun through the air as if caught by a gust of wind, then zoomed directly at the trunk through the Willow's ominously swaying branches. It jabbed at a place near the roots, and at once, the writhing tree became still. \"Perfect!\" panted Hermione. \"Wait.\" For one teetering second, while the crashes and booms of the battle filled the air, Harry hesitated. Voldemort wanted him to do this, wanted him to come...Was he leading Ron and Hermione into a trap? But the reality seemed to close upon him, cruel and plain: the only way forward was to kill the snake, and the snake was where Voldemort was, and voldemort was at the end of this tunnel... \"Harry, we're coming, just get in there!\" said Ron, pushing him forward. Harry wriggled into the earthy passage hidden in the tree's roots. It was a much tighter squeeze than it had been the last time they had entered it. The tunnel was low-ceilinged: they had had to double up to move throuhgh it nearly four years previously; now there was nothing for it but to crawl. Harry went first, his wand illuminated, expecting at any moment to meet barriers, but none came. They moved in silence, Harry's gaze fixed upon the swinging beam of the wand held in his fist. At last, the tunnel began to slope upward and Harry saw a sliver of light ahead. Hermione tugged at his ankle. \"The Cloak!\" she whispered. \"Put the Cloak on!\" He groped behind him and she forced the bundle of slippery cloth into his free hand. With difficulty he dragged it over himself, murmered, \"Nox,\" extinguishing his wandlight, and continued on his hands and knees, as silently as possible, all his senses straining, expecting every second to be discovered, to hear a cold clear voice, see a flash of green light. and then he heard voices coming from the room directly ahead of them, only slightly muffled by the fact that the opening at the endo fht etuunnel had been blocked up by what looked like an old crate. Hardly daring to breathe, Harry edged right up tot he opening and peered through a tiny gap left between crate and wall. The room beyond was dimly lit, but he could see Nagini, swirlign and coiling like a serpent underwater, safe in her enchanted, starry sphere, which floated unsupported in midair. He could see the edge of a table, and a long-fingered white hand toying with a wand. Then Snape spoke, and Harry's heart lurched: Snape was inches away from where he crouched, hidden. \"...my Lord, their resistance is crumbling--\" \"--and it is doing so without your help,\" said Voldemort in his high, clear voice. \"Skilled wizard though you are, Severus, I do not think you will make much difference now. We are almost there...almost.\" \"Let me find the boy. Let me bring you Potter. I know I can find him, my Lord. Please.\" Snape strode past the gap, and Harry drew back a little, keeping his eyes fixed upon Nagini, wondering whether there was any spell that might penetrate the protection surrounding her, but he could not think of anything. One failed attempt, and he would give away his position... Voldemort stood up. Harry could see him now, see the red eyes, the flattened, serpentine face, the pallor of him gleaming slightly in the semidarkness. \"I have a problem, Severus,\" said Voldemort softly. \"My Lord?\" said Snape. Voldemort raised the Elder Wand, holding it as delicately and precisely as a conductor's baton. \"Why doesn't it work for me, Severus?\" In the silence Harry imagined he could hear the snake hissing slightly as it coiled and uncoiled--or was it Voldemort's sibilant sigh lingering on the air? \"My--my lord?\" said Snape blankly. \"I do not understand. You--you have performed extraordinary magic with that wand.\" \"No,\" said Voldemort. \"I have performed my usual magic. I am extraordinary, but this wand...no. It has not revealed the wonders it has promised. I feel no difference between this wand and the one I procured from Ollivander all those years ago.\" Voldemort's tone was musing, calm, but Harry's scar had begun to throb and pulse: Pain was building in his forehead, and he could feel that controlled sense of fury building inside Voldemort. \"No difference,\" said Voldemort again. Snape did not speak. Harry could not see his face. He wondered whether Snape sensed danger, was trying to find the right words to reassure his master. Voldemort started to move around the room: Harry lost sight of him for seconds as he prowled, speaking in that same measured voice, while the pain and fury mounted in Harry. \"I have thought long and hard, Severus...do you know why I have called you back from battle?\" And for a moment Harry saw Snape's profile. His eyes were fixed upon the coiling snake in its enchanted cage. \"No, my Lord, but I beg you will let me return. Let me find Potter.\" \"You sound like Lucius. Neither of you understands Potter as I do. He does not need finding. Potter will come to me. I knew his weakness you see, his one great flaw. He will hate watching the others struck down around him, knwoing that it is for him that it happens. He will want to stop it at any cost. He will come.\" \"But my Lord, he might be killed accidentally by someone other than yourself--\"\\ \"My instructions to the Death Eaters have been perfectly clear. Capture Potter. Kill his friends--the more, the better--but do not kill him. \"But it is of you that I wished to speak, Severus, not Harry Potter. You have been very valuable to me. Very valuable.\" \"My Lord knows I seek only to serve him. But--let me go and find the boy, my Lord. Let me bring him to you. I know I can--\" \"I have told you, no!\" said Voldemort, and Harry caught the lgint of red in his eyes as he turned again, and the swishing of his cloak was like the slithering of a snake, and he felt Voldemort's impatience in his burning scar. \"My concern at the moment, Severus, is what will happen when I finally meet the boy!\" \"My Lord, there can be no question, surely--?\" \"--but there is a question, Severus. There is.\" Voldemort halted, and Harry could see him plainly again as he slid the Elder Wand through his white fingers, staring at Snape. \"Why did both the wands I have used fail when directed at Harry Potter?\" \"I--I cannot answer that, my Lord.\" \"Can't you?\" The stab of rage felt like a spike driven through Harry's head: he forced his own fist into his mouth to stop himself from crying out in pain. He closed his eyes, and suddenly he was Voldemort, looking into Snape's pale face. \"My wand of yew did everything of which I asked it, Severus, except to kill Harry Potter. Twice it failed. Ollivander told me under torture of the twin cores, told me to take another's wand. I did so, but Lucius's wand shattered upon meeting Potter's.\" \"I--I have no explanation, my Lord.\" Snape was not looking at Voldemort now. His dark eyes were still fixed upon the coiling serpent in its protective sphere. \"I sought a third wand, Severus. the Elder Wand, the Wand of Destiny, the Deathstick. I took it from its previous master. I took it from the grfave of Albus Dumbledore.\" And now Snape looked at Voldemort, and Snape's face was like a death mask. it was marble white and so still that when he spoke, it was a shock to see that anyone lived behind the blank eyes. \"My Lord--let me go to the boy--\" \"all this long night when I am on the brink of victory, I have sat here,\" said Voldemort, his voice barely louder than a whisper, \"wondering, wondering, why the Elder Wand refuses to be what it ought to be, refuses to perform as legend says it must perform for its rightful owner...and I think I have the answer.\" Snape did not speak. \"Perhaps you already know it? You are a clever man, after all, Severus. You have been a good and faithful servant, and I regret what must happen.\" \"My Lord--\" \"The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I am not its true master. The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner. You killed Albus Dumbledore. While you live, Severus, the Elder Wand cannot truly be mine.\" \"My Lord!\" Snape protested, raising his wand. \"It cannot be any other way,\" said Voldemort. \"I must master the wand, Severus. Master the wand, and I master Potter at last.\" And Voldemort swiped the air with the Elder Wand. It did nothing to Sanpe, who for a split second seemed to think he had been reprieved: but then Voldemort's intention became clear. The snake's cage was rolling through the air, and before Snape could do anything more than yell, it had encased him, head and shoulders, and Voldemort spoke in Parseltongue. \"Kill.\" There was a terrible scream. Harry saw Snape's face losing the little color it had left; it whitened as his black eyes widened, as the snake's fangs pierced his neck, as he failed to push the enchanted cage off himself, as his knees gave way and he fell to the floor. \"I regret it,\" said Voldemort coldly. He turned away; there was no sadness in him, no remorse. It was time to leave this shack and take charge, with a wand that would now do his full bidding. He pointed it at the starry cage holding the snake, which drifted upward, off snape, who fell sideways onto the floor, blood gushing from the wounds in his neck. Voldemort swept from the room without a backward glance, and the great serpent floated after him in its huge protective sphere. Back in the tunnel and his own mind, Harry opened his eyes; He had drawn blood biting down on his knuckles in an effort not to shout out. Now he was looking through the tiny crack between crate and wall, watching a foot in a black boot trembling on the floor. \"Harry!\" breathed Hermione behind him, but he had already pointed his wand at the crate blocking his view. It lifted an inch into the air and drifted sideways silently. As quietly as he could, he pulled himself up into the room. He did not know why he was doing it, why he was approaching the dying man: he did not know what he felt as he saw Snape's white face, adn the fingers trying to staunch the bloody wound at his neck. Harry took off the invisibility cloak and looked down upon the man he hated, whose widening black eyes found Harry as he cried to speak. Harry bent over him, and Snape seized the front of his robes and pulled him close. A terrible rasping, gurgling noise issued from Snape's throat. \"Take...it...Take...it...\" Something more than blood was leaking from Snape. Silvery blue, neither gas nor liquid, it gushed form his mouth and his ears and his eyes, and Harry knew what it was, but did not know what to do-- A flask, conjured from thin air, was thrust into his shaking hand by Hermione. Harry lfited the silvery substance into it with his wand. When the falsk was full to the brim, and Snape looked as though there was no blood left in him, his grip on Harry's robes slackened. \"Look...at....me...\" he whispered. The green eyes found the black, but after a second, something in the depths of the dark pari seemed to vanish, leaving them fixed, blank, and empty. The hand holding Harry thudded to the floor, and Snape moved no more. \n",

            "-Eight The Missing Mirror Harry's feet touched the road. He saw the achingly familiar Hogsmeade High Street: dark shop fronts, and the mist line of black mountains beyond the village and the curve in the road ahead that led off toward Hogwarts, and light spilling from the windows of the Three Broomsticks, and with a lurch of the hear, he remembered with piercing accuracy, how he had landed here nearly a year before, supporting a desperately weak Dumbledore, all this in a second, upon landing -- and then, even as he relaxed his grip upon Ron's and Hermione's arms, it happened. The air was rent by a scream that sounded like Voldemort's when he had realized the cup had been stolen: It tore at every nerve in Harry's body, and he knew that their appearance had caused it. Even as he looked at the other two beneath the Cloak, the door of the Three Broomsticks burst open and a dozen cloaked and hooded Death Eaters dashed into the streets, their wands aloft. Harry seized Ron's wrist as he raised his wand; there were too many of them to run. Even attempting it would have give away their position. One of the Death Eaters raised his wand, and the scream stopped, still echoing around the distant mountains. \"Accio Cloak!\" roared one of the Death Eaters Harry seized his folds, but it made no attempt to escape. The Summoning Charm had not worked on it. \"Not under your wrapper, then, Potter?\" yelled the Death Eater who had tried the charm and then to his fellows. \"Spread now. He's here.\" Six of the Death Eaters ran toward them: Harry, Ron and Hermione backed as quickly as possible down the nearest side street, and the Death Eaters missed them by inches. They waited in the darkness, listening to the footsteps running up and down, beams of light flying along the street from the Death Eaters' searching wands. \"Let's just leave!\" Hermione whispered. \"Disapparate now!\" \"Great idea,\" said Ron, but before Harry could reply, a Death Eater shouted, \"We know you are here, Potter, and there's no getting away! We'll find you!\" \"They were ready for us,\" whispered Harry. \"They set up that spell to tell them we'd come. I reckon they’ve done something to keep us here, trap us - \" \"What about dementors?\" called another Death Eater. \"Let'em have free rein, they'd find him quick enough!\" \"The Dark Lord wants Potter dead by no hands but his - \" \" 'an dementors won't kill him! The Dark Lord wants Potter's life, nor his soul. He'll be easier to kill if he's been Kissed first!\" There were noises of agreement. Dread filled Harry: To repel dementors they would have to produce Patronuses which would give them away immediately. \"We're going to have to try to Disapparate, Harry!\" Hermione whispered. Even as she said it, he felt the unnatural cold being spread over the street. Light was sucked from the environment right up to the stars, which vanished. In the pitch blackness, he felt Hermione take hold of his arm and together, they turned on the spot. The air through which they needed to move, seemed to have become solid: They could not Disapparate; the Death Eaters had cast their charms well. The cold was biting deeper and deeper into Harry's flesh. He, Ron and Hermione retreated down the side street, groping their way along the wall trying not to make a sound. Then, around the corner, gliding noiselessly, came dementors, ten or more of them, visible because they were of a denser darkness than their surroundings, with their black cloaks and their scabbed and rotting hands. Could they sense fear in the vicinity? Harry was sure of it: They seemed to be coming more quickly now, taking those dragging, rattling breaths he detested, tasting despair in the air, closing in - He raised his wand: He could not, would not suffer the Dementor's Kiss, whatever happened afterward. It was of Ron and Hermione that he thought as he whispered \"Expecto Patronum!\" The silver stag burst from his wand and charged: The Dementors scattered and there was a triumphant yell from somewhere out of sight \"It's him, down there, down there, I saw his Patronus, it was a stag!\" The Dementors have retreated, the stars were popping out again and the footsteps of the Death Eaters were becoming louder; but before Harry in his panic could decide what to do, there was a grinding of bolts nearby, a door opened on the left-side of the narrow street, and a rough voice said: \"Potter, in here, quick!\" He obeyed without hesitation, the three of them hurried through the open doorway. \"Upstairs, keep the Cloak on, keep quiet!\" muttered a tall figure, passing them on his way into the street and slammed the door behind him. Harry had had no idea where they were, but now he saw, by the stuttering light of a single candle, the grubby, sawdust bar of the Hog's Head Inn. They ran behind the counter and through a second doorway, which led to a trickery wooden staircase, that they climbed as fast as they could. The stairs opened into a sitting room with a durable carpet and a small fireplace, above which hung a single large oil painting of a blonde girl who gazed out at the room with a kind of a vacant sweetness. Shouts reached from the streets below. Still wearing the Invisibility Cloak on, they hurried toward the grimy window and looked down. Their savior, whom Harry now recognized as the Hog's Head's barman, was the only person not wearing a hood. \"So what?\" he was bellowing into one of the hooded faces. \"So what? You send dementors down my street, I'll send a Patronus back at'em! I'm not having'em near me, I've told you that. I'm not having it!\" \"That wasn't your Patronus,\" said a Death Eater. \"That was a stag. It was Potter's!\" \"Stag!\" roared the barman, and he pulled out a wand. \"Stag! You idiot - Expecto Patronum!\" Something huge and horned erupted from the wand. Head down, it charged toward the High Street, and out of sight. \"That's not what I saw\" said the Death Eater, though was less certainly \"Curfew's been broken, you heard the noise,\" one of his companions told the barman. \"Someone was out on the streets against regulations - \" \"If I want to put my cat out, I will, and be damned to your curfew!\" \"You set off the Caterwauling Charm?\" \"What if I did? Going to cart me off to Azkaban? Kill me for sticking my nose out my own front door? Do it, then, if you want to! But I hope for your sakes you haven't pressed your little Dark Marks, and summoned him. He's not going to like being called here, for me and my old cat, is he, now?\" \"Don't worry about us.\" said one of the Death Eaters, \"worry about yourself, breaking curfew!\" \"And where will you lot traffic potions and poisons when my pub's closed down? What will happen to your little sidelines then?\" \"Are you threatening - ?\" \"I keep my mouth shut, it's why you come here, isn't it?\" \"I still say I saw a stag Patronus!\" shouted the first Death Eater. \"Stag?\" roared the barman. \"It's a goat, idiot!\" \"All right, we made a mistake,\" said the second Death Eater. \"Break curfew again and we won't be so lenient!\" The Death Eaters strode back towards the High Street. Hermione moaned with relief, wove out from under the Cloak, and sat down on a wobble-legged chair. Harry drew the curtains then pulled the Cloak off himself and Ron. They could hear the barman down below, rebolting the door of the bar, then climbing the stairs. Harry's attention was caught by something on the mantelpiece: a small, rectangular mirror, propped on top of it, right beneath the portrait of the girl. The barman entered the room. \"You bloody fools,\" he said gruffly, looking from one to the other of them. \"What were you thinking, coming here?\" \"Thank you,\" said Harry. \"You can't thank you enough. You saved our lives!\" The barman grunted. Harry approached him looking up into the face: trying to see past the long, stringy, wire-gray hair beard. He wore spectacles. Behind the dirty lenses, the eyes were a piercing, brilliant blue. \"It's your eye I've been seeing in the mirror.\" There was a silence in the room. Harry and the barman looked at each other. \"You sent Dobby.\" The barman nodded and looked around for the elf. \"Thought he'd be with you. Where've you left him? \"He's dead,\" said Harry, \"Bellatrix Lestrange killed him.\" The barman face was impassive. After a few moments he said, \"I'm sorry to hear it, I liked that elf.\" He turned away, lightning lamps with prods of his wand, not looking at any of them. \"You're Aberforth,\" said Harry to the man's back. He neither confirmed or denied it, but bent to light the fire. \"How did you get this?\" Harry asked, walking across to Sirius's mirror, the twin of the one he had broken nearly two years before. \"Bought it from Dung 'bout a year ago,\" said Aberforth. \"Albus told me what it was. Been trying to keep an eye out for you.\" Ron gasped. \"The silver doe,\" he said excitedly, \"Was that you too?\" \"What are you talking about?\" asked Aberforth. \"Someone sent a doe Patronus to us!\" \"Brains like that, you could be a Death Eater, son. Haven't I just prove my Patronus is a goat?\" \"Oh,\" said Ron, \"Yeah... well, I'm hungry!\" he added defensively as his stomach gave an enormous rumble. \"I got food,\" said Aberforth, and he sloped out of the room, reappearing moments later with a large loaf of bread, some cheese, and a pewter jug of mead, which he set upon a small table in front of the fire. Ravenous, they ate and drank, and for a while there was sound of chewing. \"Right then,\" said Aberforth when the had eaten their fill and Harry and Ron sat slumped dozily in their chairs. \"We need to think of the best way to get you out of here. Can't be done by night, you heard what happens if anyone moves outdoors during darkness: Caterwauling Charm's set off, they'll be onto you like bowtruckles on doxy eggs. I don't reckon I'll be able to pass of a stag as a goat a second time. Wait for daybreak when curfew lifts, then you can put your Cloak back on and set out on foot. Get right out of Hogsmeade, up into the mountains, and you'll be able to Disapparate there. Might see Hagrid. He's been hiding in a cave up there with Grawp ever since they tried to arrest him.\" \"We're not leaving,\" said Harry. \"We need to get into Hogwarts.\" \"Don't be stupid, boy,\" said Aberforth. \"We've got to,\" said Harry. \"What you've got to do,\" said Aberforth, leaning forward, \"is to get as far from here as from here as you can.\" \"You don't understand. There isn't much time. We've got to get into the castle. Dumbledore - I mean, your brother - wanted us - \" The firelight made the grimy lenses of Aberforth's glasses momentarily opaque, a bright flat white, and Harry remembered the blind eyes of the giant spider, Aragog. \"My brother Albus wanted a lot of things,\" said Aberforth, \"and people had a habit of getting hurt while he was carrying out his grand plans. You get away from this school, Potter, and out of the country if you can. Forget my brother and his clever schemes. He's gone where none of this can hurt him, and you don't owe him anything.\" \"You don't understand.\" said Harry again. \"Oh, don't I? said Aberforth quietly. \"You don't think I understood my own brother? Think you know Albus better than I did?\" \"I didn't mean that,\" said Harry, whose brain felt sluggish with exhaustion and from the surfeit of food and wine. \"It's... he left me a job.\" \"Did he now?\" said Aberforth. \"Nice job, I hope? Pleasant? Easy? Sort of thing you'd expect an unqualified wizard kid to be able to do without overstretching themselves?\" Ron gave a rather grim laugh. Hermione was looking strained. \"I-it's not easy, no,\" said Harry. \"But I've got to - \" \"Got to? Why got to? He's dead, isn't he?\" said Aberforth roughly. \"Let it go, boy, before you follow him! Save yourself!\" \"I can't.\" \"Why not?\" \"I - \" Harry felt overwhelmed; he could not explain, so he took the offensive instead. \"But you're fighting too, you're in the Order of the Phoenix - \" \"I was,\" said Aberforth. \"The Order of the Phoenix is finished. You-Know-Who's won, it's over, and anyone who's pretending different's kidding themselves. It'll never be safe for you here, Potter, he wants you too badly. So go abroad, go into hiding, save yourself. Best take these two with you.\" He jerked a thumb at Ron and Hermione. \"They'll be in danger long as they live now everyone knows they've been working with you.\" \"I can't leave,\" said Harry. \"I've got a job - \" \"Give it to someone else!\" \"I can't. It's got to be me, Dumbledore explained it all - \" \"Oh, did he now? And did he tell you everything, was he honest with you?\" Harry wanted him with all his heart to say \"Yes,\" but somehow the simple word would not rise to his lips, Aberforth seemed to know what he was thinking. \"I knew my brother, Potter. He learned secrecy at our mother's knee. Secrets and lies, that's how we grew up, and Albus... he was a natural.\" The old man's eyes traveled to the painting of the girl over the mantelpiece. It was, now Harry looked around properly, the only picture in the room. There was no photograph of Albus Dumbledore, nor of anyone else. \"Mr. Dumbledore\" said Hermione rather timidly. \"Is that your sister? Ariana? \"Yes.\" said Aberforth tersely. \"Been reading Rita Skeeter, have you, missy?\" Even by the rosy light of the fire it was clear that Hermione had turned red. \"Elphias Doge mentioned her to us,\" said Harry, trying to spare Hermione. \"That old berk,\" muttered Aberforth, taking another swig of mead. \"Thought the sun shone out of my brother's every office, he did. Well, so did plenty of people, you three included, by the looks of it.\" Harry kept quiet. He did not want to express the doubts and uncertainties about Dumbledore that had riddled him for months now. He had made his choice while he dug Dobby's grave, he had decided to continue along the winding, dangerous path indicated for him by Albus Dumbledore, to accept that he had not been told everything that he wanted to know, but simply to trust. He had no desire to doubt again; he did not want o hear anything that would deflect him from his purpose. He met Aberforth's gaze, which was so strikingly like his brothers': The bright blue eyes gave the same impression that they were X-raying the object of their scrutiny, and Harry thought that Aberforth knew what he was thinking and despised him for it. \"Professor Dumbledore cared about Harry, very much,\" said Hermione in a low voice. \"Did he now?\" said Aberforth. \"Funny thing how many of the people my brother cared about very much ended up in a worse state than if he'd left 'em well alone.\" \"What do you mean?\" asked Hermione breathlessly. \"Never you mind,\" said Aberforth. \"But that's a really serious thing to say!\" said Hermione. \"Are you - are you talking about your sister?\" Aberforth glared at her: His lips moved as if he were chewing the words he was holding back. Then he burst into speech. \"When my sister was six years old, she was attacked, by three Muggle boys. They'd seen her doing magic, spying through the back garden hedge: She was a kid, she couldn't control it, no witch or wizard can at that age. What they saw, scared them, I expect. They forced their way through the hedge, and when she couldn't show them the trick, they got a bit carried away trying to stop the little freak doing it.\" Hermione's eyes were huge in the firelight; Ron looked slightly sick. Aberforth stood up, tall as Albus, and suddenly terrible in his anger and the intensity of his pain. \"It destroyed her, what they did: She was never right again. She wouldn't use magic, but she couldn't get rid of it; it turned inward and drove her mad, it exploded out of her when she couldn't control it, and at times she was strange and dangerous. But mostly she was sweet and scared and harmless. \"And my father went after the bastards that did it,\" said Aberforth, \"and attacked them. And they locked him up in Azkaban for it. He never said why he'd done it, because the Ministry had known what Ariana had become, she'd have been locked up in St. Mungo's for good. They'd have seen her as a serious threat to the International Statute of Secrecy, unbalanced like she was, with magic exploding out of her at moments when she couldn't keep it in any longer. \"We had to keep her safe and quiet. We moved house, put it about she was ill, and my mother looked after her, and tried to keep her calm and happy. \"I was her favourite,\" he said, and as he said it, a grubby schoolboy seemed to look out through Aberforth's wrinkles and wrangled beard. \"Not Albus, he was always up in his bedroom when he was home, reading his books and counting his prizes, keeping up with his correspondence with \"the most notable magical names of the day,\" Aberforth succored. \"He didn't want to be bothered with her. She liked me best. I could get her to eat when she wouldn't do it for my mother, I could calm her down, when she was in one of her rages, and when she was quiet, she used to help me feed the goats. \"Then, when she was fourteen... See, I wasn't there.\" said Aberforth. \"If I'd been there, I could have calmed her down. She had one of her rages, and my mother wasn't as young as she was, and . . . it was an accident. Ariana couldn't control it. But my mother was killed.\" Harry felt a horrible mixture of pity and repulsion; he did not want to hear any more, but Aberforth kept talking, and Harry wondered how long it had been since he had spoken about this; whether, in fact, he had ever spoken about it. \"So that put paid to Albus's trip round the world with little Doge. The pair of 'em came home for my mother's funeral and then Doge went off on his own, and Albus settled down as head of the family. Ha!\" Aberforth spat into the fire. \"I'd have looked after her, I told him so, I didn't care about school, I'd have stayed home and done it. He told me I had to finish my education and he'd take over from my mother. Bit of a comedown for Mr. Brilliant, there's no prizes for looking after your half-mad sister, stopping her blowing up the house every other day. But he did all right for a few weeks . . . till he came.\" And now a positively dangerous look crept over Aberforth’s face. \"Grindelwald. And at last, my brother had an equal to talk to someone just as bright and talented he was. And looking after Ariana took a backseat then, while they were hatching all their plans for a new Wizarding order and looking for Hallows, and whatever else it was they were so interested in. Grand plans for the benefit of all Wizardkind, and if one young girl neglected, what did that matter, when Albus was working for the greater good? \"But after a few weeks of it, I'd had enough, I had. It was nearly time for me to go hack to Hogwarts, so I told 'em, both of 'em, face-to-face, like I am to you, now,\" and Aberforth looked downward Harry, and it took a little imagination to see him as a teenager, wiry and angry, confronting his elder brother. \"I told him, you'd better give it up now. You can't move her, she's in no fit state, you can't take her with you, wherever it is you're planning to go, when you're making your clever speeches, trying to whip yourselves up a following. He didn't like that.\" said Aberforth, and his eyes were briefly occluded by the fireflight on the lenses of his glasses: They turned white and blind again. \"Grindelwald didn't like that at all. He got angry. He told me what a stupid little boy I was, trying to stand in the way of him and my brilliant brother . . . Didn't I understand, my poor sister wouldn't have to be hidden once they'd changed the world, and led the wizards out of hiding, and taught the Muggles their place? \"And there was an argument . . . and I pulled my wand, and he pulled out his, and I had the Cruciatus Curse used on me by my brother's best friend - and Albus was trying to stop him, and then all three of us were dueling, and the flashing lights and the bangs set her off, she couldn't stand it - \" The color was draining from Aberforth's face as though he had suffered a mortal wound. \" - and I think she wanted to help, but she didn't really know what she was doing, and I don't know which of us did it, it could have been any of us - and she was dead.\" His voice broke on the last word and he dropped down into the nearest chair. Hermione's face was wet with tears, and Ron was almost as pale as Aberforth. Harry felt nothing but revulsion: He wished he had not heard it, wished he could wash is mind clean of it. \"I'm so . . . I'm so sorry,\" Hermione whispered. \"Gone,\" croaked Aberforth. \"Gone forever.\" He wiped his nose on hiss cuff and cleared his throat. \" 'Course, Grindelwald scarpered. He had a bit of a track record already, back in his own country, and he didn't want Ariana set to his account too. And Albus was free, wasn't he? Free of the burden of his sister, free to become the greatest wizard of the - \" \"He was never free,\" said Harry. \"I beg your pardon?\" said Aberforth. \"Never,\" said Harry. \"The night that your brother died, he drank a potion that drove him out of his mind. He started screaming, pleading with someone who wasn't there. 'Don't hurt them, please . . . hurt me instead.' \" Ron and Hermione were staring at Harry. He had never gone into details about what had happened on the island on the lake: The events that had taken place after he and Dumbledore had returned to Hogwarts had eclipsed it so thoroughly. \"He thought he was back there with you and Grindelwald, I know he did,\" said Harry, remembering Dumbledore whispering, pleading. \"He thought he was watching Grindelwald hurting you and Ariana . . . It was torture to him, if you'd seen him then, you wouldn't say he was free.\" Aberforth seemed lost in contemplation of his own knotted and veined hands. After a long pause he said. \"How can you be sure, Potter, that my brother wasn't more interested in the greater good than in you? How can you be sure you aren't dispensable, just like my little sister?\" A shard of ice seemed to pierce Harry's heart. \"I don't believe it. Dumbledore loved Harry,\" said Hermione. \"Why didn't he tell him to hide, then? shot back Aberforth. \"Why didn't he say to him, 'Take care of yourself, here's how to survive' ?\" \"Because,\" said Harry before Hermione could answer, \"sometimes you've got to think about more than your own safety! Sometimes you've got to think about the greater good! This is war!\" \"You're seventeen, boy!\" \"I'm of age, and I'm going to keep fighting even if you've given up!\" \"Who says I've given up?\" \"The Order of the Phoenix is finished,\" Harry repeated, \"You-Know-Who's won, it's over, and anyone who's pretending different's kidding themselves.\" \"I don't say I like it, but it's the truth!\" \"No, it isn't.\" said Harry. \"Your brother knew how to finish You-Know-Who and he passed the knowledge on to me. I'm going to keep going until I succeed - or I die. Don't think I don't know how this might end. I've known it for years.\" He waited for Aberforth to jeer or to argue, but he did not. He merely moved. \"We need to get into Hogwarts,\" said Harry again. \"If you can't help us, we'll wait till daybreak, leave you in peace, and try to find a way in ourselves. If you can help us - well, now would be a great time to mention it.\" Aberforth remained fixed in his chair, gazing at Harry with the eye, that were so extraordinarily like his brother's. At last he cleared his throat, got to his feet, walked around the little table, and approached the portrait of Ariana. \"You know what to do,\" he said. She smiled, turned, and walked away, not as people in portraits usually did, one of the sides of their frames, but along what seemed to be a long tunnel painted behind her. They watched her slight figure retreating until finally she was swallowed by the darkness. \"Er - what - ?\" began Ron. \"There's only one way in now,\" said Aberforth. \"You must know they've got all the old secret passageways covered at both ends, dementors all around the boundary walls, regular patrols inside the school from what my sources tell me. The place has never been so heavily guarded. How you expect to do anything once you get inside it, with Snape in charge and the Carrows as his deputies. . . well, that's your lookout, isn't it? You say you're prepared to die.\" \"But what . . . ?\" said Hermione, frowning at Ariana's picture. A tiny white dot reappeared at the end of the painted tunnel, and now Ariana was walking back toward them, growing bigger and bigger as she came. But there was somebody else with her now, someone taller than she was, who was limping along, looking excited. His hair was longer than Harry had ever seen. He appeared and torn. Larger and larger the two figures grew, until only their heads and shoulders filled the portrait. Then the whole thing swang forward on the wall like a little door, and the entrance to a real tunnel was revealed. And our of it, his hair overgrown, his face cut, his robes ripped, clambered the real Neville Longbottom, who gave a roar of delight, leapt down from the mantelpiece and yelled. \"I knew you'd come! I knew it, Harry!\" \n",

            ": The Lightning-Struck Tower Once back under the starry sky, Harry heaved Dumbledore on to the top of the nearest boulder and then to his feet. Sodden and shivering, Dumbledore's weight still upon him, Harry con- centrated harder than he had ever done upon his destination: Hogsmeade. Closing his eyes, gripping Dumbledore's arm as tightly as he could, he stepped forwards into that feeling of horrible compression. He knew it had worked before he opened his eyes: the smell of salt, the sea breeze had gone. He and Dumbledore were shivering and dripping in the middle of the dark High Street in Hogsmeade. For one horrible moment Harry's imagination showed him more Inferi creeping towards him around the sides of shops, but he blinked and saw that noth-ing was stirring; all was still, the darkness complete but for a few streetlamps and lit upper windows. 'We did it, Professor!' Harry whispered with difficulty; he suddenly realised that he had a searing stitch in his chest. 'We did it! We got the Horcrux!' Dumbledore staggered against him. For a moment, Harry thought that his inexpert Apparition had thrown Dumbledore off-balance; then he saw his face, paler and damper than ever in the distant light of a streetlamp. 'Sir, are you all right?' 'I've been better,' said Dumbledore weakly, though the corners of his mouth twitched. That potion ... was no health drink ...\" And to Harry's horror, Dumbledore sank on to the ground. 'Sir - it's OK, sir, you're going to be all right, don't worry -' He looked around desperately for help, but there was nobody to be seen and all he could think was that he must somehow get Dumbledore quickly to the hospital wing. 'We need to get you up to the school, sir ... Madam Pomfrey ...' 'No,' said Dumbledore. 'It is ... Professor Snape whom I need ... but I do not think ... I can walk very far just yet ...' 'Right - sir, listen - I'm going to knock on a door, find a place you can stay - then I can run and get Madam -' 'Severus,' said Dumbledore clearly. 'I need Severus ...' 'All right then, Snape - but I'm going to have to leave you for a moment so I can -' Before Harry could make a move, however, he heard run- ning footsteps. His heart leapt: somebody had seen, somebody knew they needed help - and looking around he saw Madam Rosmerta scurrying down the dark street towards them on high-heeled, fluffy slippers, wearing a silk dressing-gown embroidered with dragons. 'I saw you Apparate as I was pulling my bedroom curtains! Thank goodness, thank goodness, I couldn't think what to - but what's wrong with Albus?' She came to a halt, panting, and stared down, wide-eyed, at Dumbledore. 'He's hurt,' said Harry. 'Madam Rosmerta, can he come into the Three Broomsticks while I go up to the school and get help for him?' 'You can't go up there alone! Don't you realise - haven't you seen -?' 'If you help me support him,' said Harry, not listening to her, 'I think we can get him inside -' 'What has happened?' asked Dumbledore. 'Rosmerta, what's wrong?' The - the Dark Mark, Albus.' And she pointed into the sky, in the direction of Hogwarts. Dread flooded Harry at the sound of the words ... he turned and looked. There it was, hanging in the sky above the school: the blaz- ing green skull with a serpent tongue, the mark Death Eaters left behind whenever they had entered a building ... wherever they had murdered ... 'When did it appear?' asked Dumbledore, and his hand clenched painfully upon Harry's shoulder as he struggled to his feet. 'Must have been minutes ago, it wasn't there when I put the cat out, but when I got upstairs -' 'We need to return to the castle at once,' said Dumbledore. 'Rosmerta,' and though he staggered a little, he seemed wholly in command of the situation, 'we need transport - brooms -' 'I've got a couple behind the bar,' she said, looking very frightened. 'Shall I run and fetch -?' 'No, Harry can do it.' Harry raised his wand at once. 'Accio Rosmerta's brooms.' A second later they heard a loud bang as the front door of the pub burst open; two brooms had shot out into the street and were racing each other to Harry's side, where they stopped dead, quivering slightly, at waist height. 'Rosmerta, please send a message to the Ministry,' said Dumbledore, as he mounted the broom nearest him. 'It might be that nobody within Hogwarts has yet realised anything is wrong ... Harry, put on your Invisibility Cloak.' Harry pulled his Cloak out of his pocket and threw it over himself before mounting his broom; Madam Rosmerta was already tottering back towards her pub as Harry and Dumble-dore kicked off from the ground and rose up into the air. As they sped towards the castle, Harry glanced sideways at Dumbledore, ready to grab him should he fall, but the sight of the Dark Mark seemed to have acted upon Dumbledore like a stimulant: he was bent low over his broom, his eyes fixed upon the Mark, his long silver hair and beard flying behind him in the night air. And Harry, too, looked ahead at the skull, and fear swelled inside him like a venomous bubble, compressing his lungs, driving all other discomfort from his mind ... How long had they been away? Had Ron, Hermione and Ginny's luck run out by now? Was it one of them who had caused the Mark to be set over the school, or was it Neville, or Luna, or some other member of the DA? And if it was ... he was the one who had told them to patrol the corridors, he had asked them to leave the safety of their beds ... would he be responsible, again, for the death of a friend? As they flew over the dark, twisting lane down which they had walked earlier, Harry heard, over the whistling of the night air in his ears, Dumbledore muttering in some strange language again. He thought he understood why as he felt his broom shudder for a moment when they flew over the bound-ary wall into the grounds: Dumbledore was undoing the enchantments he himself had set around the castle, so that they could enter at speed. The Dark Mark was glittering directly above the Astronomy Tower, the highest of the castle. Did that mean the death had occurred there? Dumbledore had already crossed the crenellated ramparts and was dismounting; Harry landed next to him seconds later and looked around. The ramparts were deserted. The door to the spiral staircase that led back into the castle was closed. There was no sign of a struggle, of a fight to the death, of a body. 'What does it mean?' Harry asked Dumbledore, looking up at the green skull with its serpent's tongue glinting evilly above them. 'Is it the real Mark? Has someone definitely been - Professor?' In the dim green glow from the Mark Harry saw Dumble-dore clutching at his chest with his blackened hand. 'Go and wake Severus,' said Dumbledore faintly but clearly. Tell him what has happened and bring him to me. Do noth- ing else, speak to nobody else and do not remove your Cloak. I shall wait here.' 'But -' 'You swore to obey me, Harry - go!' Harry hurried over to the door leading to the spiral stair-case, but his hand had only just closed upon the iron ring of the door when he heard running footsteps on the other side. He looked round at Dumbledore, who gestured to him to retreat. Harry backed away, drawing his wand as he did so. The door burst open and somebody erupted through it and shouted: 'Expelliarmus!' Harry's body became instantly rigid and immobile, and he felt himself fall back against the Tower wall, propped like an unsteady statue, unable to move or speak. He could not understand how it had happened - Expelliarmus was not a Freezing Charm - Then, by the light of the Mark, he saw Dumbledore's wand flying in an arc over the edge of the ramparts and under-stood ... Dumbledore had wordlessly immobilised Harry, and the second he had taken to perform the spell had cost him the chance of defending himself. Standing against the ramparts, very white in the face, Dumbledore still showed no sign of panic or distress. He merely looked across at his disarmer and said, 'Good evening, Draco.' Malfoy stepped forwards, glancing around quickly to check that he and Dumbledore were alone. His eyes fell upon the second broom. 'Who else is here?' 'A question 1 might ask you. Or are you acting alone?' Harry saw Malfoy's pale eyes shift back to Dumbledore in the greenish glare of the Mark. 'No,' he said. 'I've got back-up. There are Death Eaters here in your school tonight.' 'Well, well,' said Dumbledore, as though Malfoy was show- ing him an ambitious homework project. 'Very good indeed. You found a way to let them in, did you?' 'Yeah,' said Malfoy, who was panting. 'Right under your nose and you never realised!' 'Ingenious,' said Dumbledore. 'Yet ... forgive me ... where are they now? You seem unsupported.' They met some of your guard. They're having a fight down below. They won't be long ... I came on ahead. I - I've got a job to do.' 'Well, then, you must get on and do it, my dear boy,' said Dumbledore softly. There was silence. Harry stood imprisoned within his own invisible, paralysed body, staring at the two of them, his ears straining to hear sounds of the Death Eaters' distant fight, and in front of him, Draco Malfoy did nothing but stare at Albus Dumbledore who, incredibly, smiled. 'Draco, Draco, you are not a killer.' 'How do you know?' said Malfoy at once. He seemed to realise how childish the words had sounded; Harry saw him flush in the Mark's greenish light. 'You don't know what I'm capable of,' said Malfoy more forcefully, 'you don't know what I've done!' 'Oh, yes, I do,' said Dumbledore mildly. 'You almost killed Katie Bell and Ronald Weasley. You have been trying, with increasing desperation, to kill me all year. Forgive me, Draco, but they have been feeble attempts ... so feeble, to be honest, that I wonder whether your heart has been really in it...' 'It has been in it!' said Malfoy vehemently. 'I've been work- ing on it all year, and tonight -' Somewhere in the depths of the castle below Harry heard a muffled yell. Malfoy stiffened and glanced over his shoulder. 'Somebody is putting up a good fight,' said Dumbledore conversationally. 'But you were saying ... yes, you have man-aged to introduce Death Eaters into my school which, I admit, I thought impossible ... how did you do it?' But Malfoy said nothing: he was still listening to whatever was happening below and seemed almost as paralysed as Harry was. 'Perhaps you ought to get on with the job alone,' suggested Dumbledore. 'What if your back-up has been thwarted by my guard? As you have perhaps realised, there are members of the Order of the Phoenix here tonight, too. And after all, you don't really need help ... I have no wand at the moment ... I cannot defend myself.' Malfoy merely stared at him. 'I see,' said Dumbledore kindly, when Malfoy neither moved nor spoke. 'You are afraid to act until they join you.'» 'I'm not afraid!' snarled Malfoy, though he still made no move to hurt Dumbledore. 'It's you who should be scared!' 'But why? I don't think you will kill me, Draco. Killing is not nearly as easy as the innocent believe ... so tell me, while we wait for your friends ... how did you smuggle them in here? It seems to have taken you a long time to work out how to do it.' Malfoy looked as though he was fighting down the urge to shout, or to vomit. He gulped and took several deep breaths, glaring at Dumbledore, his wand pointing directly at the latter's heart. Then, as though he could not help himself, he said, '1 had to mend that broken Vanishing Cabinet that no one's used for years. The one Montague got lost in last year.' 'Aaaah.' Dumbledore's sigh was half a groan. He closed his eyes for a moment. That was clever ... there is a pair, I take it?' 'The other's in Borgin and Burkes,' said Malfoy, 'and they make a kind of passage between them. Montague told me that when he was stuck in the Hogwarts one, he was trapped in limbo but sometimes he could hear what was going on at school, and sometimes what was going on in the shop, as if the Cabinet was travelling between them, but he couldn't make anyone hear him ... in the end he managed to Apparate out, even though he'd never passed his test. He nearly died doing it. Everyone thought it was a really good story, but I was the only one who realised what it meant - even Borgin didn't know - 1 was the one who realised there could be a way into Hogwarts through the Cabinets if I fixed the broken one.' 'Very good,' murmured Dumbledore. 'So the Death Eaters were able to pass from Borgin and Burkes into the school to help you ... a clever plan, a very clever plan ... and, as you say, right under my nose ...' 'Yeah,' said Malfoy who, bizarrely, seemed to draw courage and comfort from Dumbledore's praise. 'Yeah, it was!' 'But there were times,' Dumbledore went on, 'weren't there, when you were not sure you would succeed in mending the Cabinet? And you resorted to crude and badly judged meas-ures such as sending me a cursed necklace that was bound to reach the wrong hands ... poisoning mead there was only the slightest chance I might drink ...' 'Yeah, well, you still didn't realise who was behind that stuff, did you?' sneered Malfoy, as Dumbledore slid a little down the ramparts, the strength in his legs apparently fading, and Harry struggled fruitlessly, mutely, against the enchantment binding him. 'As a matter of fact, I did,' said Dumbledore. 'I was sure it was you.' 'Why didn't you stop me, then?' Malfoy demanded. 'I tried, Draco. Professor Snape has been keeping watch over you on my orders -' 'He hasn't been doing your orders, he promised my mother -' 'Of course that is what he would tell you, Draco, but -' 'He's a double-agent, you stupid old man, he isn't working for you, you just think he is!' 'We must agree to differ on that, Draco. It so happens that I trust Professor Snape -' 'Well, you're losing your grip, then!' sneered Malfoy. 'He's been offering me plenty of help - wanting all the glory for himself - wanting a bit of the action - \"What are you doing? Did you do the necklace, that was stupid, it could have blown everything -\" But I haven't told him what I've been doing in the Room of Requirement, he's going to wake up tomorrow and it'll all be over and he won't be the Dark Lord's favourite any more, he'll be nothing compared to me, nothing!' 'Very gratifying,' said Dumbledore mildly. 'We all like* appreciation for our own hard work, of course ... but you must have had an accomplice, all the same ... someone in Hogsmeade, someone who was able to slip Katie the - the - aaaah Dumbledore closed his eyes again and nodded, as though he was about to fall asleep. '... of course ... Rosmerta. How long has she been under the Imperius Curse?' 'Got there at last, have you?' Malfoy taunted. There was another yell from below, rather louder than the last. Malfoy looked nervously over his shoulder again, then back at Dumbledore, who went on, 'So poor Rosmerta was forced to lurk in her own bathroom and pass that necklace to any Hogwarts student who entered the room unaccompanied? And the poisoned mead ... well, naturally, Rosmerta was able to poison it for you before she sent the bottle to Slughorn, believing that it was to be my Christmas present ... yes, very neat ... very neat ... poor Mr Filch would not, of course, think to check a bottle of Rosmerta's ... tell me, how have you been communicating with Rosmerta? I thought we had all methods of communication in and out of the school monitored.' 'Enchanted coins,' said Malfoy, as though he was compelled to keep talking, though his wand hand was shaking badly. 'I had one and she had the other and 1 could send her messages -' 'Isn't that the secret method of communication the group that called themselves Dumbledore's Army used last year?' asked Dumbledore. His voice was light and conversational, but Harry saw him slip an inch lower down the wall as he said it. 'Yeah, I got the idea from them,' said Malfoy, with a twisted smile. 'I got the idea of poisoning the mead from the Mudblood Granger, as well, I heard her talking in the library about Filch not recognising potions ...' Hogsmeade, someone who was able to slip Katie the - the - aaaah Dumbledore closed his eyes again and nodded, as though he was about to fall asleep. '... of course ... Rosmerta. How long has she been under the Imperius Curse?' 'Got there at last, have you?' Malfoy taunted. There was another yell from below, rather louder than the last. Malfoy looked nervously over his shoulder again, then back at Dumbledore, who went on, 'So poor Rosmerta was forced to lurk in her own bathroom and pass that necklace to any Hogwarts student who entered the room unaccompanied?

His voice was light and conversational, but Harry saw him slip an inch lower down the wall as he said it. 'Yeah, I got the idea from them,' said Malfoy, with a twisted smile. 'I got the idea of poisoning the mead from the Mudblood Granger, as well, I heard her talking in the library about Filch not recognising potions ...' 'Please do not use that offensive word in front of me,' said Dumbledore. Malfoy gave a harsh laugh. 'You care about me saying \"Mudblood\" when I'm about to kill you?' 'Yes, I do,' said Dumbledore, and Harry saw his feet slide a little on the floor as he struggled to remain upright. 'But as for being about to kill me, Draco, you have had several long minutes now. We are quite alone. I am more defenceless than you can have dreamed of finding me, and still you have not acted ...' Malfoy's mouth contorted involuntarily, as though he had tasted something very bitter. 'Now, about tonight,' Dumbledore went on, 'I am a little puzzled about how it happened ... you knew that I had left the school? But of course,' he answered his own question, 'Rosmerta saw me leaving, she tipped you off using your ingenious coins, I'm sure ...' 'That's right,' said Malfoy. 'But she said you were just going for a drink, you'd be back ...' 'Well, I certainly did have a drink ... and I came back ... after a fashion,' mumbled Dumbledore. 'So you decided to spring a trap for me?' 'We decided to put the Dark Mark over the Tower and get you to hurry up here, to see who'd been killed,' said Malfoy. 'And it worked!' 'Well ... yes and no ...' said Dumbledore. 'But am I to take it, then, that nobody has been murdered?' 'Someone's dead,' said Malfoy and his voice seemed to go up an octave as he said it. 'One of your people ... I don't know who, it was dark ... I stepped over the body ... I was* supposed to be waiting up here when you got back, only your Phoenix lot got in the way ...' 'Yes, they do that,' said Dumbledore. There was a bang and shouts from below, louder than ever; it sounded as though people were fighting on the actual spiral staircase that led to where Dumbledore, Malfoy and Harry stood, and Harry's heart thundered unheard in his invisible chest ... someone was dead ... Malfoy had stepped over the body ... but who was it? There is little time, one way or another,' said Dumbledore. 'So let us discuss your options, Draco.' 'My options!' said Malfoy loudly. 'I'm standing here with a wand - I'm about to kill you -' 'My dear boy, let us have no more pretence about that. If you were going to kill me, you would have done it when you first Disarmed me, you would not have stopped for this pleasant chat about ways and means.' 'I haven't got any options!' said Malfoy, and he was sud- denly as white as Dumbledore. 'I've got to do it! He'll kill me! He'll kill my whole family!' 'I appreciate the difficulty of your position,' said Dumbledore. 'Why else do you think I have not confronted you before now? Because I knew that you would have been murdered if Lord Voldemort realised that I suspected you.' Malfoy winced at the sound of the name. 'I did not dare speak to you of the mission with which I knew you had been entrusted, in case he used Legilimency against you,' continued Dumbledore. 'But now at last we can speak plainly to each other ... no harm has been done, you have hurt nobody, though you are very lucky that your unintentional victims survived ... I can help you, Draco.' 'No, you can't,' said Malfoy, his wand hand shaking very badly indeed. 'Nobody can. He told me to do it or he'll kill me. I've got no choice.' 'Come over to the right side, Draco, and we can hide you more completely than you can possibly imagine. What is more, I can send members of the Order to your mother tonight to hide her likewise. Your father is safe at the moment in Azkaban ... when the time comes we can protect him too ... come over to the right side, Draco ... you are not a killer ...' Malfoy stared at Dumbledore. 'But I got this far, didn't I?' he said slowly. They thought I'd die in the attempt, but I'm here ... and you're in my power ... I'm the one with the wand ... you're at my mercy ...' 'No, Draco,' said Dumbledore quietly. 'It is my mercy, and not yours, that matters now.' Malfoy did not speak. His mouth was open, his wand hand still trembling. Harry thought he saw it drop by a fraction - But suddenly footsteps were thundering up the stairs and a second later Malfoy was buffeted out of the way as four people in black robes burst through the door on to the ram-parts. Still paralysed, his eyes staring unblinkingly, Harry gazed in terror upon four strangers: it seemed the Death Eaters had won the fight below. A lumpy-looking man with an odd lopsided leer gave a wheezy giggle. 'Dumbledore cornered!' he said, and he turned to a stocky little woman who looked as though she could be his sister and who was grinning eagerly. 'Dumbledore wandless, Dumbledore alone! Well done, Draco, well done!' 'Good evening, Amycus,' said Dumbledore calmly, as though welcoming the man to a tea party. 'And you've brought Alecto too ... charming ...' The woman gave an angry little titter. Think your little jokes'll help you on your death bed, then?' she jeered. 'Jokes? No, no, these are manners,' replied Dumbledore. 'Do it,' said the stranger standing nearest to Harry, a big, rangy man with matted grey hair and whiskers, whose black Death Eater's robes looked uncomfortably tight. He had a voice like none that Harry had ever heard: a rasping bark of a voice. Harry could smell a powerful mixture of dirt, sweat and, unmistakeably, of blood coming from him. His filthy hands had long yellowish nails. 'Is that you, Fenrir?' asked Dumbledore. That's right,' rasped the other. 'Pleased to see me, Dumbledore?' 'No, I cannot say that I am ...' Fenrir Greyback grinned, showing pointed teeth. Blood trickled down his chin and he licked his lips slowly, obscenely. 'But you know how much I like kids, Dumbledore.' 'Am I to take it that you are attacking even without the full moon now? This is most unusual ... you have developed a taste for human flesh that cannot be satisfied once a month?' That's right,' said Greyback. 'Shocks you, that, does it, Dumbledore? Frightens you?' 'Well, I cannot pretend it does not disgust me a little,' said Dumbledore. 'And, yes, I am a little shocked that Draco here invited you, of all people, into the school where his friends live...' 'I didn't,' breathed Malfoy. He was not looking at Greyback; he did not seem to want to even glance at him. 'I didn't know he was going to come -' 'I wouldn't want to miss a trip to Hogwarts, Dumbledore,' rasped Greyback. 'Not when there are throats to be ripped out ... delicious, delicious ...' And he raised a yellow fingernail and picked at his front teeth, leering at Dumbledore. '1 could do you for afters, Dumbledore ...' 'No,' said the fourth Death Eater sharply. He had a heavy, brutal-looking face. 'We've got orders. Draco's got to do it. Now, Draco, and quickly.' Malfoy was showing less resolution than ever. He looked terrified as he stared into Dumbledore's face, which was even paler, and rather lower than usual, as he had slid so far down the rampart wall. 'He's not long for this world anyway, if you ask me!' said the lopsided man, to the accompaniment of his sister's wheezing giggles. 'Look at him - what's happened to you, then, Dumby?' 'Oh, weaker resistance, slower reflexes, Amycus,' said Dumbledore. 'Old age, in short ... one day, perhaps, it will happen to you ... if you are lucky ...' 'What's that mean, then, what's that mean?' yelled the Death Eater, suddenly violent. 'Always the same, weren't yeh, Dumby, talking and doing nothing, nothing, I don't even know why the Dark Lord's bothering to kill yeh! Come on, Draco, do it!' But at that moment, there were renewed sounds of scuffling from below and a voice shouted, 'They've blocked the stairs - Reducto! REDUCTO!' Harry's heart leapt: so these four had not eliminated all opposition, but merely broken through the fight to the top of the Tower, and, by the sound of it, created a barrier behind them - 'Now, Draco, quickly!' said the brutal-faced man angrily. But Malfoy's hand was shaking so badly that he could barely aim. Til do it,' snarled Greyback, moving towards Dumbledore with his hands outstretched, his teeth bared. 'I said no!' shouted the brutal-faced man; there was a flash of light and the werewolf was blasted out of the way; he hit the ramparts and staggered, looking furious. Harry's heart was hammering so hard it seemed impossible that nobody could hear him standing there, imprisoned by Dumbledore's spell -if he could only move, he could aim a curse from under the Cloak - 'Draco, do it, or stand aside so one of us -' screeched the woman, but at that precise moment the door to the ramparts burst open once more and there stood Snape, his wand clutched in his hand as his black eyes swept the scene, from Dumbledore slumped against the wall, to the four Death Eaters, including the enraged werewolf, and Malfoy. 'We've got a problem, Snape,' said the lumpy Amycus, whose eyes and wand were fixed alike upon Dumbledore, 'the boy doesn't seem able -' But somebody else had spoken Snape's name, quite softly. 'Severus ...' The sound frightened Harry beyond anything he had experienced all evening. For the first time, Dumbledore was pleading. Snape said nothing, but walked forwards and pushed Malfoy roughly out of the way. The three Death Eaters fell back without a word. Even the werewolf seemed cowed. Snape gazed for a moment at Dumbledore, and there was revulsion and hatred etched in the harsh lines of his face. 'Severus ... please ...\" Snape raised his wand and pointed it directly at Dumbledore. 'Avada Kedavra!' A jet of green light shot from the end of Snape's wand and hit Dumbledore squarely in the chest. Harry's scream of horror never left him; silent and unmoving, he was forced to watch as Dumbledore was blasted into the air: for a split second he seemed to hang suspended beneath the shining skull, and then he fell slowly backwards, like a great rag doll, over the battlements and out of sight. \n",

            "-Five King’s Cross He lay facedown, listening to the silence. He was perfectly alone. Nobody was watching. Nobody else was there. He was not perfectly sure that he was there himself. A long time later, or maybe no time at all, it came to him that he must exist, must be more than disembodied thought, because he was lying, definitely lying, on some surface. Therefore he had a sense of touch, and the thing against which he lay existed too. Almost as soon as he had reached this conclusion, Harry became conscious that he was naked. Convinced as he was of his total solitude, this did not concern him, but it did intrigue him slightly. He wondered whether, as he could feel, he would be able to see. In opening them, he discovered that he had eyes. He lay in a bright mist, though it was not like mist he had ever experienced before. His surroundings were not hidden by cloudy vapor; rather the cloudy vapor had not yet formed into surroundings. The floor on which he lay seemed to be white, neither warm nor cold, but simply there, a flat, blank something on which to be. He sat up. His body appeared unscathed. He touched his face. He was not wearing glasses anymore. Then a noise reached him through the unformed nothingness that surrounded him: the small soft thumpings of something that flapped, flailed, and struggled. It was a pitiful noise, yet also slightly indecent. He had the uncomfortable feeling that he was eavesdropping on something furtive, shameful. For the first time, he wished he were clothed. Barely had the wish formed in his head than robes appeared a short distance away. He took them and pulled them on. They were soft, clean, and warm. It was extraordinary how they had appeared just like that, the moment he had wanted them. . . . He stood up, looking around. Was he in some great Room of Requirement? The longer he looked, the more there was to see. A great domed glass roof glittered high above him in sunlight. Perhaps it was a palace. All was hushed and still, except for those odd thumping and whimpering noises coming from somewhere close by in the mist. . . . Harry turned slowly on the spot, and his surroundings seemed to invent themselves before his eyes. A wide-open space, bright and clean, a hall larger by far than the Great Hall, with that clear domed glass ceiling. It was quite empty. He was the only person there, except for - He recoiled. He had spotted the thing that was making the noises. It had the form of a small, naked child, curled on the ground, its skin raw and rough, flayed-looking, and it lay shuddering under a seat where it had been left, unwanted, stuffed out of sight, struggling for breath. He was afraid of it. Small and fragile and wounded though it was, he did not want to approach it. Nevertheless he drew slowly nearer, ready to jump back at any moment. Soon he stood near enough to touch it, yet he could not bring himself to do it. He felt like a coward. He ought to comfort it, but it repulsed him. \"You cannot help.\" He spun around. Albus Dumbledore was walking toward him, sprightly and upright, wearing sweeping robes of midnight blue. \"Harry.\" He spread his arms wide, and his hands were both whole and white and undamaged. \"You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk.\" Stunned, Harry followed as Dumbledore strode away from where the flayed child lay whimpering, leading him to two seats that Harry had not previously noticed, set some distance away under that high, sparkling ceiling. Dumbledore sat down in one of them, and Harry fell into the other, staring at his old headmaster’s face. Dumbledore’s long silver hair and beard, the piercingly blue eyes behind half-moon spectacles, the crooked nose: Everything was as he had remembered it. And yet . . . \"But you’re dead,\" said Harry. \"Oh yes,\" said Dumbledore matter-of-factly. \"Then . . . I’m dead too?\" \"Ah,\" said Dumbledore, smiling still more broadly. \"That is the question, isn’t it? On the whole, dear boy, I think not.\" They looked at each other, the old man still beaming. \"Not?\" repeated Harry. \"Not,\" said Dumbledore. \"But . . .\" Harry raised his hand instinctively toward the lightning scar. It did not seem to be there. \"But I should have died - I didn’t defend myself! I meant to let him kill me!\" \"And that,\" said Dumbledore, \"will, I think, have made all the difference.\" Happiness seemed to radiate from Dumbledore like light; like fire: Harry had never seen the man so utterly, so palpably content. \"Explain,\" said Harry. \"But you already know,\" said Dumbledore. He twiddled his thumbs together. \"I let him kill me,\" said Harry. \"Didn’t I?\" \"You did,\" said Dumbledore, nodding. \"Go on!\" \"So the part of his soul that was in me . . .\" Dumbledore nodded still more enthusiastically, urging Harry onward, a broad smile of encouragement on his face. \". . . has it gone?\" \"Oh yes!\" said Dumbledore. \"Yes, he destroyed it. Your soul is whole, and completely your own, Harry.\" \"But then . . .\" Harry trembled over his shoulder to where the small, maimed creature trembled under the chair. \"What is that, Professor?\" \"something that is beyond either of our help,\" said Dumbledore. \"But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,\" Harry started again, \"and nobody died for me this time - how can I be alive?\" \"I think you know,\" said Dumbledore. \"Think back. Remember what he did, in his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.\" Harry thought. He let his gaze drift over his surroundings. If it was indeed a palace in which they sat, it was an odd one, with chairs set in little rows and bits of railing here and there, and still, he and Dumbledore and the stunted creatures under the chair were the only beings there. Then the answer rose to his lips easily, without effort. \"He took my blood,\" said Harry. \"Precisely!\" said Dumbledore. \"He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily’s protection inside both of you! He thethered you to life while he lives!\" \"I live . . . while he lives? But I thought . . . I thought it was the other way around! I thought we both had to die? Or is it the same thing?\" He was distracted by the whimpering and thumping of the agonized creature behind them and glanced back at it yet again. \"Are you sure we can’t do anything?\" \"There is no help possible.\" \"Then explain . . . more,\" said Harry, and Dumbledore smiled. \"You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry, the Horcrux he never meant to make. He had rendered his soul so unstable that it broke apart when he committed those acts of unspeakable evil, the murder of your parents, the attempted killing of a child. But what escaped from that room was even less than he knew. He left more than his body behind. He left part of himself latched to you, the would-be victim who had survived. \"And his knowledge remained woefully incomplete, Harry! That which Voldemort does not value, he takes no trouble to comprehend. Of house-elves and children’s tales, of love, loyalty, and innocence, Voldemort knows and understands nothing. Nothing. That they all have a power beyond his own, a power beyond the reach of any magic, is a truth he has never grasped. \"He took your blood believing it would strengthen him. He took into his body a tiny part of the enchantment your mother laid upon you when she died for you. His body keeps her sacrafice alive, and while that enchantment survives, so do you and so does Voldemort’s one last hope for himself.\" Dumbledore smiled at Harry, and Harry stared at him. \"And you knew this? You knew - all along?\" \"I guessed. But my guesses have usually been good,\" said Dumbledore happily, and they sat in silence for what seemed like a long time, while the creature behind them continued to whimper and tremble. \"There’s more,\" said Harry. \"There’s more to it. Why did my wand break the wand he borrowed?\" \"As to that, I cannot be sure.\" \"Have a guess, then,\" said Harry, and Dumbledore laughed. \"What you must understand, Harry, is that you and Lord Voldemort have journeyed together into realms of magic hitherto unknown and untested. But here is what I think happened, and it is unprecedented, and no wandmaker could, I think, ever have predicted or explained it to Voldemort. \"Without meaning to, as you now know, Lord Voldemort doubled the bond between you when he returned to a human form. A part of his soul was still attached to yours, and, thinking to strengthen himself, he took a part of your mother’s sacrafice into himself. If he could only have understood the precise and terrible power of that sacrifice, he would not, perhaps, have dared to touch your blood. . . . But then, if he had been able to understand, he could not be Lord Voldemort, and might never have murdered at all. \"Having ensured this two-fold connection, having wrapped your destinies together more securely than ever two wizards were joined in history, Voldemort proceeded to attack you with a wand that shared a core with yours. And now something very strange happened, as we know. The cores reacted in a way that Lord Voldemort, who never knew that your wand was a twin of his, had ever expected. \"He was more afraid than you were that night, Harry. You had accepted, even embraced, the possibility of death, something Lord Voldemort has never been able to do. Your courage won, your wand overpowered his. And in doing so, something happened between those wands, something that echoed the relationship between their masters. \"I believe that your wand imbibed some of the power and qualities of Voldemort’s wand that night, which is to say that it contained a little of Voldemort himself. So your wand recognized him when he pursued you, recognized a man who was both kin and mortal enemy, and it regurgitated some of his own magic against him, magic much more powerful than anything Lucius’s wand had ever performed. Your wand now contained the power of your enormous courage and of Voldemort’s own deadly skill: What chance did that poor stick of Lucius Malfoy’s stand?\" \"But if my wand was so powerful, how come Hermione was able to break it?\" asked Harry. \"My dear boy, its remarkable effects were directed only at Voldemort, who had tampered so ill-advisedly with the deepest laws of magic. Only toward him was that wand abnormally powerful. Otherwise it was a wand like any other . . . though a good one, I am sure,\" Dumbledore finished kindly. Harry sat in thought for a long time, or perhaps seconds. It was very hard to be sure of things like time, here. \"He killed me with your wand.\" \"He failed to kill you with my wand,\" Dumbledore corrected Harry. \"I think we can agree that you are not dead - though, of course,\" he added, as if fearing he had been discourteous, \"I do not minimize your sufferings, which I am sure were severe.\" \"I feel great at the moment, though,\" said Harry, looking down at his clean, unblemished hands. \"Where are we, exactly?\" \"Well, I was going to ask you that,\" said Dumbledore, looking around. \"Where would you say that we are?\" Until Dumbledore had asked, Harry had not known. Now, however, he found that he had an answer ready to give. \"It looks,\" he said slowly, \"like King’s Cross station. Except a lo cleaner and empty, and there are no trains as far as I can see.\" \"King’s Cross station!\" Dumbledore was chuckling immoderately. \"Good gracious, really?\" \"Well, where do you think we are?\" asked Harry, a little defensively. \"My dear boy, I have no idea. This is, as they say, your party.\" Harry had no idea what this meant; Dumbledore was being infuriating. He glared at him, then remembered a much more pressing question than that of their current location. \"The Deathly Hallows,\" he said, and he was glad to see that the words wiped the smile from Dumbledore’s face. \"Ah, yes,\" he said. He even looked a little worried. \"Well?\" For the first time since Harry had met Dumbledore, he looked less than an old man, much less. He looked fleetingly like a small boy caught in wrongdoing. \"Can you forgive me?\" he said. \"Can you forgive me for not trusting you? For not telling you? Harry, I only feared that you would fail as I had failed. I only dreaded that you would make my mistakes. I crave your pardon, Harry. I have known, for some time now, that you are the better man.\" \"What are you talking about?\" asked Harry, startled by Dumbledore’s tone, by the sudden tears in his eyes. \"The Hallows, the Hallows,\" murmured Dumbledore. \"A desperate man’s dream!\" \"But they’re real!\" \"Real, and dangerous, and a lure for fools,\" said Dumbledore. \"And I was such a fool. But you know, don’t you? I have no secrets from you anymore. You know.\" \"What do I know?\" Dumbledore turned his whole body to face Harry, and tears still sparkled in the brilliantly blue eyes. \"Master of death, Harry, master of Death! Was I better, ultimately, than Voldemort?\" \"Of course you were,\" said Harry. \"Of course - how can you ask that? You never killed if you could avoid it!\" \"True, true,\" said Dumbledore, and he was like a child seeking reassurance. \"Yet I too sought a way to conquer death, Harry.\" \"Not the way he did,\" said Harry. After all his anger at Dumbledore, how odd it was to sit here, beneath the high, vaulted ceiling, and defend Dumbledore from himself. \"Hallows, not Horcruxes.\" \"Hallows,\" murmured Dumbledore, \"not Horcruxes. Precisely.\" There was a pause. The creature behind them whimpered, but Harry no longer looked around. \"Grindelwald was looking for them too?\" he asked. Dumbledore closed his eyes for a moment and nodded. \"It was the thing, above all, that drew us together,\" he said quietly. \"Two clever, arrogant boys with a shared obsession. He wanted to come to Godric’s Hollow, as I am sure you have guessed, because of the grave of Ignotus Peverell. He wanted to explore the place the third brother had died.\" \"So it’s true?\" asked Harry. \"All of it? The Peverell brothers -\" \"-were the three brothers of the tale,\" said Dumbledore, nodding. \"Oh yes, I think so. Whether they met Death on a lonely road . . . I think it more likely that the Peverell brothers were simply gifted, dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those powerful objects. The story of them being Death’s own Hallows seems to me the sort of legend that might have sprung up around such creations. \"The Cloak, as you know now, traveled down through the ages, father to son, mother to daughter, right down to Ignotus’s last living descendant, who was born, as Ignotus was, in the village of Godric’s Hollow.\" Dumbledore smiled at Harry. \"Me?\" \"You. You have guessed,, I know, why the Cloak was in my possession on the night your parents died. James had showed it to me just a few days previously. It explained much of his undetected wrongdoing at school! I could hardly believe what I was seeing. I asked to borrow it, to examine it. I had long since given up my dream of uniting the Hallows, but I could not resist, could not help taking a closer look. . . . It was a Cloak the likes of which I had never seen, immensely old, perfect in every respect . . . and then your father died, and I had two Hallows at last, all to myself!\" His tone was unbearably bitter. \"The Cloak wouldn’t have helped them survive, though,\" Harry said quickly. \"Voldemort knew where my mum and dad were. The Cloak couldn’t have made them curse-proof.\" \"true,\" sighed Dumbledore. \"True.\" Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not speak, so he prompted him. \"So you’d given up looking for the Hallows when you saw the Cloak?\" \"Oh yes,\" said Dumbledore faintly. It seemed that he forced himself to meet Harry’s eyes. \"You know what happened. You know. You cannot despise me more than I despise myself.\" \"But I don’t despise you -\" \"Then you should,\" said Dumbledore. He drew a deep breath. \"You know the secret of my sister’s ill health, what those Muggles did, what she became. You know how my poor father sought revenge, and paid the price, died In Azkaban. You know how my mother gave up her own life to care for Ariana. \"I resented it, Harry.\" Dumbledore stated it baldly, coldly. He was looking now over the top of Harry’s head, into the distance. \"I was gifted, I was brilliant. I wanted to escape. I wanted to shine. I wanted glory. \"Do not misunderstand me,\" he said, and pain crossed the face so that he looked ancient again. \"I loved them, I loved my parents, I loved my brother and my sister, but I was selfish, Harry, more selfish than you, who are a remarkably selfless person, could possibly imagine. \"So that, when my mother died, and I was left the responsibility of a damaged sister and a wayward brother, I returned to my village in anger and bitterness. Trapped and wasted, I thought! And then of course, he came. . . .\" Dumbledore looked directly into Harry’s eyes again. \"Grindelwald. You cannot imagine how his ideas caught me, Harry, inflamed me. Muggles forced into subservience. We wizards triumphant. Grindelwald and I, the glorious young leaders of the revolution. \"Oh, I had a few scruples. I assuaged my conscience with empty words. It would all be for the greater good, and any harm done would be repaid a hundredfold in benefits for wizards. Did I know, in my heart of hearts, what Gellert Grindelwald was? I think I did, but I closed my eyes. If the plans we were making came to fruition, all my dreams would come true. \"And at the heart of our schemes, the Deathly Hallows! How they fascinated him, how they fascinated both of us! The unbeatable wand, the weapon that would lead us to power! The Resurrection Stone - to him, though I pretended not to know it, it meant an army of Inferi! To me, I confess, it meant the return of my parents, and the lifting of all responsibility from my shoulders. \"And the Cloak . . . somehow, we never discussed the Cloak much, Harry. Both of us could conceal ourselves well enough without the Cloak, the true magic of which, of course, is that it can be used to protect and shield others as well as its owner. I thought that, if we ever found it, it might be useful in hiding Ariana, but our interest in the Cloak was mainly that it completed the trio, for the legend said that the man who had united all three objects would then be truly master of death, which we took to mean ‘invincible.’ \"Invincible masters of death, Grindelwald and Dumbledore! Two months of insanity, of cruel dreams, and neglect of the only two members of my family left to me. \"And then . . . you know what happened. Reality returned in the form of my rough, unlettered, and infinitely more admirable brother. I did not want to hear the truths he shouted at me. I did not want to hear that I could not set forth and seek Hallows with a fragile and unstable sister in tow. \"The argument became a fight. Grindelwald lost control. That which I had always sensed in him, though I pretended not to, now sprang into terrible being. And Ariana . . . after all my mother’s care and caution . . . lay dead upon the floor.\" Dumbledore gave a little gasp and began to cry in earnest. Harry reached out and was glad to find that he could touch him: He gripped his arm tightly and Dumbledore gradually regained control. \"Well, Grindelwald fled, as anyone but I could have predicted. He vanished, with his plans for seizing power, and his schemes for Muggle torture, and his dreams of the Deathly Hallows, dreams in which I had encouraged him and helped him. He ran, while I was left to bury my sister, and learn to live with my guilt and my terrible grief, the price of my shame. \"Years passed. There were rumors about him. They said he had procured a wand of immense power. I, meanwhile, was offered the post of Minister of Magic, not once, but several times. Naturally, I refused. I had learned that I was not to be trusted with power.\" \"But you’d have been better, much better, than Fudge or Scimgeour!\" burst out Harry. \"Would I?\" asked Dumbledore heavily. \"I am not so sure. I had proven, as a very young man, that power was my weakness and my temptation. It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those who, like you, have leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle because they must, and find to their own surprise that they wear it well. \"I was safer at Hogwarts. I think I was a good teacher -\" \"You were the best ---\" \"--- you are very kind, Harry. But while I busied myself with the training of young wizards, Grindelwald was raising an army. They say he feared me, and perhaps he did, but less, I think, than I feared him. \"Oh, not death,\" said Dumbledore, in answer to Harry’s questioning look. \"Not what he could do to me magically. I knew that we were evenly matched, perhaps that I was a shade more skillful. It was the truth I feared. You see, I never knew which of us, in that last, horrific fight, had actually cast the curse that killed my sister. You may call me cowardly: You would be right, Harry. I dreaded beyond all things the knowledge that it had been I who brought about her death, not merely through my arrogance and stupidity, but that I actually struck the blow that snuffed out her life. \"I think he knew it, I think he knew what frightened me. I delayed meeting him until finally, it would have been too shameful to resist any longer. People were dying and he seemed unstoppable, and I had to do what I could. \"Well, you know what happened next. I won the duel. I won the wand.\" Another silence. Harry did not ask whether Dumbledore had ever found out who struck Ariana dead. He did not want to know, and even less did he want Dumbledore to have to tell him. At last he knew what Dumbledore would have seen when he looked in the mirror of Erised, and why Dumbledore had been so understanding of the fascination it had exercised over Harry. They sat in silence for a long time, and the whipmerings of the creature behind them barely disturbed Harry anymore. At last he said, \"Grindelwald tried to stop Voldemort going after the wand. He lied, you know, pretended he had never had it.\" Dumbledore nodded, looking down at his lap, tears still glittering on the crooked nose. \"They say he showed remorse in later years, alone in his cell at Nurmengard. I hope that is true. I would like to think that he did feel the horror and shame of what he had done. Perhaps that lie to Voldemort was his attempt to make amends . . . to prevent Voldemort from taking the Hallow . . .\" \". . .or maybe from breaking into your tomb?\" suggested Harry, and Dumbledore dabbed his eyes. After another short pause Harry said, \"You tried to use the Resurrection Stone.\" Dumbledore nodded. \"When I discovered it, after all those years, buried in the abandoned home of the Gaunts --- the Hallow I had craved most of all, though in my youth I had wanted it for very different reasons --- I lost my head, Harry. I quite forgot that I was not a Horcrux, that the ring was sure to carry a curse. I picked it up, and I put it on, and for a second I imagined that I was about to see Ariana, and my mother, and my father, and to tell them how very, very sorry, I was. . . . \"I was such a fool, Harry. After all those years I had learned nothing. I was unworthy to unite the Deathly Hallows, I had proved it time and again, and here was final proof.\" \"Why?\" said Harry. \"It was natural! You wanted to see them again. What’s wrong with that?\" \"Maybe a man in a million could unite the Hallows, Harry. I was fit only to possess the meanest of them, the least extraordinary. I was fit to own the Elder Wand, and not boast of it, and not to kill with it. I was permitted to tame and use it, because I took it, not for gain, but to save others from it. \"But the Cloak, I took out of vain curiousity, and so it could never have worked for me as it works for you, its true owners. The stone I would have used in an attempt to drag back those who are at peace, rather than enable my self-sacrafice, as you did. You are the worthy possessor of the Hallows.\" Dumbledore patted Harry’s hand, and Harry looked up at the old man and smiled; he could not help himself. How coul dhe remain angry with Dumbledore now? \"Why did you have to make it so difficult?\" Dumbledore’s smile was tremulous. \"I am afraid I counted on Miss Granger to slow you up, Harry. I was afraid that your hot head might dominate your good heart. I was scared that, if presented outright with the facts about those tempting objects, you might seize the Hallows as I did, at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons. If you laid hands on them, I wanted you to possess them safely. You are the true master of death, because the true master does not seek to run away from Death. He accepts that he must die, and understands that there are far, far worse things in the living world than dying.\" \"And Voldemort never knew about the Hallows?\" \"I do not think so, because he did not recognize the Resurrection Stone he turned into a Horcrux. But even if he had known about them, Harry. I doubt that he woul dhave been interested in any except the first. He would not think that he needed the Cloak, and as for the stone, whom would he want to bring back from the dead? He fears the dead. He does not love.\" \"But you expected him to go after the wand?\" \"I have been sure that he would try, ever since your wand beat Voldemort’s in the graveyard of Little Hangleton. At first, he was afraid that you had conquered him by superior skill. Once he had kidnapped Ollivander, however, he discovered the existence of the twin cores. He thought that explained everything. Yet the borrowed wand did no better against yours! So Voldemort, instead of asking himself what quality it was in you that had made your wand so strong, what gift you possessed that he did not, naturally set out to find the one wand that, they said, would beat any other. For him, the Elder Wand has become an obsession to rival his obsession with you. He believes that the Elder Wand removes his last weakness and makes him truly invincible. Poor Severus . . .\" \"If you planned your death with Snape, you meant him to end up with the Elder Wand, didn’t you?\" \"I admit that was my intention,\" said Dumbledore, \"but it did not work as I intended, did it?\" \"No,\" said Harry. \"That bit didn’t work out.\" The creature behind them jerked and moaned, and Harry and Dumbledore sate without talking for the longest time yet. The realization of what would happen next settled gradually over Harry in the long minutes, like softly falling snow. \"I’ve got to go back, haven’t I?\" \"That is up to you.\" \"I’ve got a choice?\" \"Oh yes,\" Dumbledore smiled at him. \"We are in King’s Cross you say? I think that if you decided not to go back, you would be able to . . . let’s say . . . board a train.\" \"And where would it take me?\" \"On,\" said Dumbledore simply. Silence again. \"Voldemort’s got the Elder Wand.\" \"True. Voldemort has the Elder Wand.\" \"But you want me to go back?\" \"I think,\" said Dumbledore, \"that if you choose to return, there is a chance that he may be finished for good. I cannot promise it. But I know this, Harry, that you have less to fear from returning here than he does.\" Harry glanced again at the raw looking thing that trembled and choked in the shadow beneath the distant chair. \"Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and above all, those who live without love. By returning, you may ensure that fewer souls are maimed, fewer families are torn apart. If that seems to you a worthy goal, they we saw good-bye for the present.\" Harry nodded and sighed. Leaving this place would not be nearly as hard as walking into the forest had been, but it was warm and light and peaceful here, and he knew that he was heading back to pain and the fear of more loss. He stood up, and Dumbledore did the same, and they looked for a long moment into each other’s faces. \"Tell me one last thing,\" said Harry, \"Is this real? Or has this been happening inside my head?\" Dumbledore beamed at him, and his voice sounded loud and strong in Harry’s ears even though the bright mist was descending again, obscuring his figure. \"Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean it is not real?\" \n",

            "-One The Tale of the Three Brothers Harry turned to look at Ron and Hermione. Neither of them seemed to have understood what Xenophilius had said either. \"The Deathly Hallows?\" \"That's right,\" said Xenophilius. \"You haven't heard of them? I'm not surprised. Very, very few wizards believe. Witness that knuckle-headed young man at your brother's wedding,\" he nodded at Ron, \"who attacked me for sporting the symbol of a well-known Dark wizard! Such ignorance. There is nothing Dark about the Hallows - at least not in that crude sense. One simply uses the symbol to reveal oneself to other believers, in the hope that they might help one with the Quest.\" He stirred several lumps of sugar into his Gurdyroot infusion and drank some. \"I'm sorry,\" said Harry, \"I still don't really understand.\" To be polite, he took a sip from his cup too, and almost gagged: The stuff was quite disgusting, as though someone had liquidized bogey-flavored Every Flavor Beans. \"Well, you see, believers seek the Deathly Hallows,\" said Xenophilius, smacking his lips in apparent appreciation of the Gurdyroot infusion. \"But what are the Deathly Hallows?\" asked Hermione. Xenophilius set aside his empty teacup. \"I assume that you are familiar with 'The Tale of the Three Brothers'?\" Harry said, \"No,\" but Ron and Hermione both said, \"Yes.\" Xenophilius nodded gravely. \"Well, well, Mr. Potter, the whole thing starts with 'The Tale of the Three Brothers' . . . I have a copy somewhere . . .\" He glanced vaguely around the room, at the piles of parchment and books, but Hermione said, \"I've got a copy, Mr. Lovegood, I've got it right here.\" And she pulled out The Tales of Beedle the Bard from the small, beaded bag. \"The original?\" inquired Xenophilius sharply, and when she nodded, he said, \"Well then, why don't you read it out aloud? Much the best way to make sure we all understand.\" \"Er. . . all right,\" said Hermione nervously. She opened the book, and Harry saw that the symbol they were investigating headed the top of the page as she gave a little cough, and began to read. \"'There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight -'\" \"Midnight, our mum always told us,\" said Ron, who had stretched out, arms behind his head, to listen. Hermione shot him a look of annoyance. \"Sorry, I just think it's a bit spookier if it's midnight!\" said Ron. \"Yeah, because we really need a bit more fear in our lives,\" said Harry before he could stop himself. Xenophilius did not seem to be paying much attention, but was staring out of the window at the sky. \"Go on, Hermione.\" \"In time, the brothers reached a river too deep to wade through and too dangerous to swim across. However, these brothers were learned in the magical arts, and so they simply waved their wands and made a bridge appear across the treacherous water. They were halfway across it when they found their path blocked by a hooded figure. \"'And Death spoke to them -'\" \"Sorry,\" interjected Harry, \"but Death spoke to them?\" \"It's a fairy tale, Harry!\" \"Right, sorry. Go on.\" \"'And Death spoke to them. He was angry that he had been cheated out of the three new victims, for travelers usually drowned in the river. But Death was cunning. He pretended to congratulate the three brothers upon their magic, and said that each had earned a prize for having been clever enough to evade him. \"'So the oldest brother, who was a combative man, asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence: a wand that must always win duels for its owner, a wand worthy of a wizard who had conquered Death! So Death crossed to an elder tree on the banks of the river, fashioned a wand from a branch that hung there, and gave it to the oldest brother. \"'Then the second brother, who was an arrogant man, decided that he wanted to humiliate Death still further, and asked for the power to recall others from Death. So Death picked up a stone from the riverbank and gave it to the second brother, and told him that the stone would have the power to bring back the dead. \"'And then Death asked the third and youngest brother what he would like. The youngest brother was the humblest and also the wisest of the brothers, and he did not trust Death. So he asked for something that would enable him to go forth from that place without being followed by Death. And Death, most unwillingly, handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.'\" \"Death's got an Invisibility Cloak?\" Harry interrupted again. \"So he can sneak up on people,\" said Ron. \"Sometimes he gets bored of running at them, flapping his arms and shrieking . . . sorry, Hermione.\" \"'Then Death stood aside and allowed the three brothers to continue on their way, and they did so talking with wonder of the adventure they had had and admiring Death's gifts. \"'In due course the brothers separated, each for his own destination. \"'The first brother traveled on for a week more, and reaching a distant village, sought out a fellow wizard with whom he had a quarrel. Naturally, with the Elder Wand as his weapon, he could not fail to win the duel that followed. Leaving his enemy dead upon the floor the oldest brother proceeded to an inn, where he boasted loudly of the powerful wand he had snatched from Death himself, and of how it made him invincible. \"'That very night, another wizard crept upon the oldest brother as he lay, wine-sodden upon his bed. The thief took the wand and for good measure, slit the oldest brother's throat. \"'And so Death took the first brother for his own. \"'Meanwhile, the second brother journeyed to his own home, where he lived alone. Here he took out the stone that had the power to recall the dead, and turned it thrice in his hand. To his amazement and his delight, the figure of the girl he had once hoped to marry, before her untimely death, appeared at once before him. \"'Yet she was sad and cold, separated from him as by a veil. Though she had returned to the mortal world, she did not truly belong there and suffered. Finally the second brother, driven mad with hopeless longing, killed himself so as to truly join her. \"'And so Death took the second brother from his own. \"'But though Death searched for the third brother for many years, he was never able to find him. It was only when he had attained a great age that the youngest brother finally took off the Cloak of Invisibility and gave it to his son. And the he greeted Death as an old friend, and went with him gladly, and, equals, they departed this life.'\" Hermione closed the book. It was a moment or two before Xenophilius seemed to realize that she had stopped reading; then he withdrew his gaze from the window and said: \"Well, there you are.\" \"Sorry?\" said Hermione, sounding confused. \"Those are the Deathly Hallows,\" said Xenophilius. He picked up a quill from a packed table at his elbow, and pulled a torn piece of parchment from between more books. \"The Elder Wand,\" he said, and drew a straight vertical line upon the parchment. \"The Resurrection Stone,\" he said, and added a circle on top of the line. \"The Cloak of Invisibility,\" he finished, enclosing both line and circle in a triangle, to make the symbols that so intrigued Hermione. \"Together,\" he said, \"the Deathly Hallows.\" \"But there's no mention of the words 'Deathly Hallows' in the story,\" said Hermione. \"Well, of course not,\" said Xenophilius, maddeningly smug. \"That is a children's tale, told to amuse rather than to instruct. Those of us who understand these matters, however, recognize that the ancient story refers to three objects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make the possessor master of Death.\" There was a short silence in which Xenophilius glanced out of the window. Already the sun was low in the sky. \"Luna ought to have enough Plimpies soon,\" he said quietly. \"When you say 'master of Death' -\"said Ron. \"Master,\" said Xenophilius, waving an airy hand. \"Conqueror. Vanquisher. Whichever term you prefer.\" \"But then . . . do you mean . . .\" said Hermione slowly, and Harry could tell that she was trying to keep any trace of skepticism out of her voice, \"that you believe these objects - these Hallows - really exist?\" Xenophilius raised his eyebrows again. \"Well, of course.\" \"But,\" said Hermione, and Harry could hear her restraint starting to crack, \"Mr. Lovegood, how can you possibly believe - ?\" \"Luna has told me all about you, young lady,\" said Xenophilius. \"You are, I gather, not unintelligent, but painfully limited. Narrow. Close-minded.\" \"Perhaps you ought to try on the hat, Hermione,\" said Ron, nodding toward the ludicrous headdress. His voice shook with the strain of not laughing. \"Mr. Lovegood,\" Hermione began again, \"We all know that there are such things as Invisibility Cloaks. They are rare, but they exist. But -\" \"Ah, but the Third Hallow is a true Cloak of Invisibility, Miss Granger! I mean to say, it is not a traveling cloak imbued with a Disillusionment Charm, or carrying a Bedazzling Hex, or else woven from Demiguise hair, which will hide one initially but fade with the years until it turns opaque. We are talking about a cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible, and endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable concealment, no matter what spells are cast at it. How many cloaks have you ever seen like that, Miss Granger?\" Hermione opened her mouth to answer, then closed it again, looking more confused than ever. She, Harry and Ron glanced at one another, and Harry knew that they were all thinking the same thing. It so happened that a cloak exactly like the one Xenophilius had just described was in the room with them at that very moment. \"Exactly,\" said Xenophilius, as if he had defeated them all in reasoned argument. \"None of you have ever seen such a thing. The possessor would be immeasurably rich, would he not?\" He glanced out of the window again. The sky was now tinged with the faintest trace of pink. \"All right,\" said Hermione, disconcerted. \"Say the Cloak existed. . . what about that stone, Mr. Lovegood? The thing you call the Resurrection Stone?\" \"What of it?\" \"Well, how can that be real?\" \"Prove that is not,\" said Xenophilius. Hermione looked outraged. \"But that's - I'm sorry, but that's completely ridiculous! How can I possibly prove it doesn't exist? Do you expect me to get hold of - of all the pebbles in the world and test them? I mean, you could claim that anything's real if the only basis for believing in it is that nobody's proved it doesn't exist!\" \"Yes, you could,\" said Xenophilius. \"I am glad to see that you are opening your mind a little.\" \"So the Elder Wand,\" said Harry quickly, before Hermione could retort, \"you think that exists too?\" \"Oh, well, in that case there is endless evidence,\" said Xenophilius. \"The Elder Wand is the Hallow that is most easily traced, because of the way in which it passes from hand to hand.\" \"Which is what?\" asked Harry. \"Which is that the possessor of the wand must capture it from its previous owner, if he is to be truly master of it,\" said Xenophilius. \"Surely you have heard of the way the wand came to Egbert the Egregious, after his slaughter of Emeric the Evil? Of how Godelot died in his own cellar after his son, Hereward, took the wand from him? Of the dreadful Loxias, who took the wand from Baraabas Deverill, whom he had killed? The bloody trail of the Elder Wand is splattered across the pages of Wizarding history.\" Harry glanced at Hermione. She was frowning at Xenophilius, but she did not contradict him. \"So where do you think the Elder Wand is now?\" asked Ron. \"Alas, who knows?\" said Xenophilius, as he gazed out of the window. \"Who knows where the Elder Wand lies hidden? The trail goes cold with Arcus and Livius. Who can say which of them really defeated Loxias, and which took the wand? And who can say who may have defeated them? History, alas, does not tell us.\" There was a pause. Finally Hermione asked stiffly, \"Mr. Lovegood, does the Peverell family have anything to do with the Deathly Hallows?\" Xenophilius looked taken aback as something shifted in Harry's memory, but he could not locate it. Peverell. . . he had heard that name before. . . \"But you have been misleading me, young woman!\" said Xenophilius, now sitting up much straighter in his chair and goggling at Hermione. \"I thought you were new to the Hallows Quest! Many of us Questers believe that the Peverells have everything - everything! - to do with the Hallows!\" \"Who are the Peverells?\" asked Ron. \"That was the name on the grave with the mark on it, in Godric's Hollow,\" said Hermione, still watching Xenophilius. \"Ignotus Peverell.\" \"Exactly!\" said Xenophilius, his forefinger raised pedantically. \"The sign of the Death Hallows on Ignotus's grave is conclusive proof!\" \"Of what?\" asked Ron. \"Why, that the three brothers in the story were actually the three Peverell brothers, Antioch, Cadmus and Ignotus! That they were the original owners of the Hallows!\" With another glance at the window he got to his feet, picked up the tray, and headed for the spiral staircase. \"You will stay for dinner?\" he called, as he vanished downstairs again. \"Everybody always requests our recipe for Freshwater Plimply soup.\" \"Probably to show the Poisoning Department at St. Mungo's,\" said Ron under his breath. Harry waited until they could hear Xenophilius moving about in the kitchen downstairs before speaking. \"What do you think?\" he asked Hermione. \"Oh, Harry,\" she said wearily, \"it's a pile of utter rubbish. This can't be what the sign really means. This must just be his weird take on it. What a waste of time.\" \"I s'pose this is the man who brought us Crumple-Horned Snorkacks,\" said Ron. \"You didn't believe it either?\" Harry asked him. \"Nah, that story's just one of those things you tell kids to teach them lessons, isn't it? 'Don't go looking for trouble, don't go pick fights, don't go messing around with stuff that's best left alone! Just keep your head down, mind your own business, and you'll be okay. Come to think of it,\" Ron added, \"maybe that story's why elder wands are supposed to be unlucky.\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"One of those superstitions, isn't it? 'May-born witches will marry Muggles.' 'Jinx by twilight, undone by midnight.' 'Wand of cider, never prosper.' You must have heard them. My mum's full of them.\" \"Harry and I were raised by Muggles,\" Hermione reminded him. \"We were taught different superstitions.\" She sighed deeply as a rather pungent smell drifted up from the kitchen. The one good thing about her exasperation with Xenophilius was that it seemed to have made her forget that she was annoyed at Ron. \"I think you're right,\" she told him. \"It's just a morality tale, it's obvious which gift is best, which one you'd choose -\" The three of them spoke at the same time: Hermione said, \"the Cloak,\" Ron said, \"the wand,\" and Harry said, \"the stone.\" They looked at each other, half surprised, half amused. \"You're supposed to say the Cloak,\" Ron told Hermione, \"but you wouldn't need to be invisible if you had the wand. An unbeatable wand, Hermione, come on!\" \"We've already got an Invisibility Cloak,\" said Harry, \"And it's helped us rather a lot, in case you hadn't noticed!\" said Hermione. \"Whereas the wand would be bound to attract trouble--\" \"Only if you shouted about it,\" argued Ron. \"Only if you were prat enough to go dancing around waving it over your head, and singing, 'I've got an unbeatable want, come and have a go if you think you're hard enough.' As long as you kept your trap shut --\" -Yes, but could you keep your trap shut?\" said Hermione, looking skeptical. \"You know the only true thing he said to us was that there have been stories about extra-powerful wands for hundreds of years.\" \"There have?\" asked Harry. Hermione looked exasperated: The expression was so endearingly familiar that Harry and Ron grinned at each other. \"The Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, they crop up under different names through the centuries, usually in the possession of some Dark wizard who’s boasting about them. Professor Binns mentioned some of them, but -- oh it's all nonsense. Wands are only as powerful as the wizards who use them. Some wizards just like to boast that theirs are bigger and better than other people's\" \"But how do you know,\" said Harry, \"that those wants -- the Deathstick, and the Wand of Destiny -- aren't the same want, surfacing over the centuries under different names?\" \"What if they're all really the Elder Wand, made by Death?\" said Ron. Harry laughed: The strange idea that had occurred to him was after all, ridiculous. His wand, he reminded himself, had been of holly, not elder, and it had been made by Ollivander, whatever it had done that night Voldemort had pursued him across the skies and if it had been unbeatable, how could it have been broken? \"So why would you take the stone?\" Ron asked him. \"Well, if you could bring people back, we could have Sirius...Mad-Eye...Dumbledore...my parents...\" Neither Ron nor Hermione smiled. \"But according to Beedle the Bard, they wouldn't want to come back, would they?\" said Harry, thinking about the tail they had just heard. \"I don't suppose there have been loads of other stories about a stone that can raise the dead, have there?: he asked Hermione. \"No,\" she replied sadly. \"I don't think anyone except Mr. Lovegood could kid themselves that's possible. Beedle probably took the idea from the Sorcerer's Stone; you know, instead of a stone to make you immortal, a stone to reverse death.\" The smell from the kitchen was getting stronger. It was something like burning underpants. Harry wondered whether it would be possible to eat enough of whatever Xenophilius was cooking to spare his feelings. \"What about the Cloak, though?\" said Ron slowly. \"Don't you realize, he's right? I've got so used to Harry's Cloak and how good it is, I never stopped to think. I've never heard of one like Harry's. It's infallible. We've never been spotted under it --\" \"Of course not -- we're invisible when we're under it, Ron!\" \"But all the stuff he said about other cloaks, and they're not exactly ten a Knut, you know, is true! It's never occurred to me before but I've heard stuff about charms wearing off cloaks when they get old, or them being ripped apart by spells so they've got holes, Harry's was owned by his dad, so it's not exactly new, is it, but it's just ... perfect!\" \"Yes, all right, but Ron, the stone...\" As they argued in whispers, Harry moved around the room, only half listening. Reaching the spiral stair, he raised his eyes absently to the next level and was distracted at once. His own face was looking back at him from the ceiling of the room above. After a moment's bewilderment, he realized that it was not a mirror, but a painting. Curious, he began to clime the stairs. \"Harry, what are you doing? I don't think you should look around when he's not here!\" But Harry had already reached the next level. Luna had decorated her bedroom ceiling with five beautifully painted faces: Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Neville. They were not moving as the portraits at Hogwarts moved, but there was a certain magic about them all the same. Harry thought they breathed. What appeared to be a fine golden chains wove around the pictures linking them together, but after examining them for a minute or so, Harry realized that the chains were actually one work repeated a thousand times in golden ink: friends... friends... friends... Harry felt a great rush of affection for Luna. He looked around the room. There was a large photograph beside the bed, of a young Luna and a woman who looked very like her. They were hugging. Luna looked rather better-groomed in this picture than Harry had ever seen her in life. The picture was dusty. This struck Harry as slightly odd. He stared around. Something was wrong. The pale blue carpet was also thick with dust. There were no clothes in the wardrobe, whose doors stood ajar. The bed had a cold, unfriendly look, as though it had not been slept in for weeks. A single cobweb stretched over the nearest window across the blood red sky. \"What's wrong?\" Hermione asked as Harry descended the staircase, but before he could respond, Xenophilius reached the top of the stairs from the kitchen, now holding a tray laden with bowls. \"Mr. Lovegood,\" said Harry. \"Where's Luna?\" \"Excuse me?\" \"Where's Luna?\" Xenophilius halted on the top step. \"I -- I've already told you. She is down at the Botions Bridge fishing for Plimpies.\" \"So why have you only laid that tray for four?\" Xenophilius tried to speak, but no sound came out. The only noise was the continued chugging of the printing press, and a slight rattle from the tray as Xenophilius's hands shook. \"I don't think Luna's been here for weeks.\" said Harry. \"Her clothes are gone, her bed hasn't been slept in. Where is she? and why do you keep looking out of the window?\" Xenophilius dropped the tray. The bowls bounced and smashed Harry, Ron, and Hermione drew their wands. Xenophilius froze his hand about to enter his pocket. At that moment the printing press have a huge bank and numerous Quibblers came streaming across the floor from underneath the tablecloth, the press fell silent at last. Hermione stooped down and picked up one of the magazines, her wand still pointing at Mr. Lovegood. \"Harry, look at this\" He strode over to her as quickly as he could through all the clutter. The front of the Quibbler carried his own picture, emblazoned with the words \"Undesirable Number One\" and captioned with the reward money. \"The Quibbler's going for a new angle, then?: Harry asked coldly, his mind working very fast. \"Is that what you were doing when you went into the garden, Mr. Lovegood? Sending an owl to the Ministry? Xenophilius licked his lips \"They took my Luna,\" he whispered, \"Because of what I've been writing. They took my Luna and I don't know where she is, what they've done to her. But they might give her back to me if I -- If I--\" \"Hand over Harry?\" Hermione finished for him. \"No deal.\" said Ron flatly. \"Get out of the way, we're leaving.\" Xenophilius looked ghastly, a century old, his lips drawn back into a dreadful leer. \"They will be here any moment. I must save Luna. I cannot lose Luna. You must not leave.\" He spread his arms in front of the staircase, and Harry had a sudden vision of his mother doing the same thing in front of his crib. \"Don't make us hurt you,\" Harry said. \"Get out of the way, Mr. Lovegood.\" \"HARRY!\" Hermione screamed. Figures on broomsticks were flying past the windows. As the three of them looked away from him. Xenophilius drew his wand. Harry realized their mistake just in time. He launched himself sideways, shoving Ron and Hermione out of harm's way as Xenophilius's Stunning Spell soared across the room and hit the Erumpent horn. There was a colossal explosion. The sound of it seemed to blow the room apart. Fragments of wood and paper and rubble flew in all directions, along with an impenetrable cloud of thick white dust. Harry flew through the air, then crashed to the floor, unable to see as debris rained upon him, his arms over his head. He heard Hermione's scream, Ron's yell, and a series of sickening metallic thuds which told him that Xenophilius had been blasted off his feet and fallen backward down the spiral stairs. Half buried in rubble, Harry tried to raise himself. He could barely breathe or see for dust. Half of the ceiling had fall in and the end of Luna's bead was hanging through the hole. The bust of Rowena Ravenclaw lay beside him with half its face missing fragments of torn parchment were floating through the air, and most of the printing press lay on its side, blocking the top of the staircase to the kitchen. Then another white shape moved close by, and Hermione, coated in dust like a second statue, pressed his finger to her lips. The door downstairs crashed open. \"Didn't I tell you there was no need to hurry, Travers?\" said a rough voice. \"Didn't I tell you this nutter was just raving as usual?\" There was a bang and a scream of pain from Xenophilius. \"No...no...upstairs...Potter!\" \"I told you last week Lovegood, we weren't coming back for anything less than some solid information! Remember last week? When you wanted to swap your daughter for that stupid bleeding headdress? And the week before\" -- Another bang, another squeal -- \"When you thought we'd give her back if you offered us proof there are Cumple\" -- Bang -- \"Headed\"--bang--\"Snorkacks?\" \"No -- no -- I beg of you!\" sobbed Xenophilius. \"It really is Potter, Really!\" \"And now it turns out you only called us here to try and blow us up!\" roared the Death Eater, and there was a volley of bangs interspersed with squeals of agony from Xenophilius. \"The place looks like it's about to fall in, Selwyn,\" said a cool second voice, echoing up the mangled staircase. \"The stairs are completely blocked. Could try clearing it? Might bring the place down.\" \"You lying piece of filth.\" shouted the wizard named Selwyn. \"You have never seen Potter in your life, have you? Thought you'd lure us here to kill us, did you? And you think you'll get your girl back like this?\" \"I swear...I swear...Potter's upstairs!\" \"Homenum revelio.\" said the voice at the foot of the stairs. Harry heard Hermione gasp, and he had the odd sensation something was swooping low over him, immersing his body in its shadow. \"There's someone up there all right, Selwyn,\" said the second man sharply. \"It's Potter, I tell you, it's Potter!\" sobbed Xenophilius. \"Please...please...give me Luna, just let me have Luna...\" \"You can have your little girl, Lovegood,\" said Selwyn, \"if you get up those stairs and bring me down Harry Potter. But if this is a plot, if it's a trick, if you've got an accomplice waiting up there to ambush us, we'll see if we can spare a bit of your daughter for you to bury.\" Xenophilius gave a wail of fear and despair. There were scurryings and scrapings. Xenophilius was trying to get through the debris on the stairs. \"Come on,\" Harry whispered, \"we've got to get out of here.\" He started to dig himself out under cover of all the noise Xenophilius was making on the staircase. Ron was buried the deepest. Harry and Hermione climbed, as quietly as they could, over all the wreckage to where he lay, trying to prise a heavy chest of drawers off his legs. While Xenophilius banging and scraping drew nearer and nearer, Hermione managed to free Ron with the use of a Hover Charm. \"All right.\" breathed Hermione, as the broken printing press blocking the top of the stairs begin to tremble. Xenophilius was feet away from them. She was still white with dust. \"Do you trust me Harry?\" Harry nodded. \"Okay then.\" Hermione whispered. \"give me the invisibility Cloak. Ron, you're going to put it on.\" \"Me? But Harry --\" \"Please, Ron! Harry, hold on tight to my hand, Ron grab my shoulder.\" Harry held out his left hand. Ron vanished beneath the Cloak. The printing press blocking the stairs was vibrating. Xenophilius was trying to shift it using a Hover Charm. Harry did not know what Hermione was waiting for. \"Hold tight\" she whispered. \"Hold tight...any second...\" Xenophilius's paper-white face appeared over the top of the sideboard. \"Obliviate!\" cried Hermione, pointing her want first into his face then at the floor beneath them. \"Deprimo!\" She had blasted a hole in the sitting room floor. They fell like boulders. Harry still holding onto her hand for dear life, there was a scream from below, and he glimpsed two men trying to get out of the way as vast quantities of rubble and broken furniture rained all around them from the shattered ceiling. Hermione twisted in midair and thundering of the collapsing house rang in Harry's ears as she dragged him once more into darkness. \n",

            " A Place to Hide Everything seemed fuzzy, slow. Harry and Hermione jumped to their feet and drew their wands. Many people were only just realizing that something strange had happened; heads were still turning toward the silver cat as it vanished. Silence spread outward in cold ripples from the place where the Patronus had landed. Then somebody screamed. Harry and Hermione threw themselves into the panicking crowd. Guests were sprinting in all directions; many were Disapparating; the protective enchantments around the Burrow had broken. \"Ron!\" Hermione cried. \"Ron, where are you?\" As they pushed their way across the dance floor, Harry saw cloaked and masked figures appearing in the crowd; then he saw Lupin and Tonks, their wands raised, and heard both of them shout, \"Protego!\", a cry that was echoed on all sides - \"Ron! Ron!\" Hermione called, half sobbing as she and Harry were buffered by terrified guests: Harry seized her hand to make sure they weren’t separated as a streak of light whizzed over their heads, whether a protective charm or something more sinister he did not know - And then Ron was there. He caught hold of Hermione’s free arm, and Harry felt her turn on the spot; sight and sound were extinguished as darkness pressed in upon him; all he could feel was Hermiones hand as he was squeezed through space and time, away from the Burrow, away from the descending Death Eaters, away, perhaps, from Voldemort himself. . . . \"Where are we?\" said Ron’s voice. Harry opened his eyes. For a moment he thought they had not left the wedding after all; They still seemed to be surrounded by people. \"Tottenham Court Road,\" panted Hermione. \"Walk, just walk, we need to find somewhere for you to change.\" Harry did as she asked. They half walked, half ran up the wide dark street thronged with late-night revelers and lined with closed shops, stars twinkling above them. A double-decker bus rumbled by and a group of merry pub-goers ogled them as they passed; Harry and Ron were still wearing dress robes. \"Hermione, we haven’t got anything to change into,\" Ron told her, as a young woman burst into raucous giggles at the sight of him. \"Why didn’t I make sure I had the Invisibility Cloak with me?\" said Harry, inwardly cursing his own stupidity. \"All last year I kept it on me and -\" \"It’s okay, I’ve got the Cloak, I’ve got clothes for both of you,\" said Hermione, \"Just try and act naturally until - this will do.\" She led them down a side street, then into the shelter of a shadowy alleyway. \"When you say you’ve got the Cloak, and clothes . . .\" said Harry, frowning at Hermione, who was carrying nothing except her small beaded handbag, in which she was now rummaging. \"Yes, they’re here,\" said Hermione, and to Harry and Ron’s utter astonishment, she pulled out a pair of jeans, a sweatshirt, some maroon socks, and finally the silvery Invisibility Cloak. \"How the ruddy hell - ?\" \"Undetectable Extension Charm,\" said Hermione. \"Tricky, but I think I’ve done it okay; anyway, I managed to fit everything we need in here.\" She gave the fragile-looking bag a little shake and it echoed like a cargo hold as a number of heavy objects rolled around inside it. \"Oh, damn, that’ll be the books,\" she said, peering into it, \"and I had them all stacked by subject. . . . Oh well. . . . Harry, you’d better take the Invisibility Cloak. Ron, hurry up and change. . . .\" \"When did you do all this?\" Harry asked as Ron stripped off his robes. \"I told you at the Burrow, I’ve had the essentials packed for days, you know, in case we needed to make a quick getaway. I packed your rucksack this morning, Harry, after you changed, and put it in here. . . . I just had a feeling. . . .\" \"You’re amazing, you are,\" said Ron, handing her his bundled-up robes. \"Thank you,\" said Hermione, managing a small smile as she pushed the robes into the bag. \"Please, Harry, get that Cloak on!\" Harry threw his Invisibility Cloak around his shoulders and pulled it up over his head, vanishing from sight. He was only just beginning to appreciate what had happened. \"The others - everybody at the wedding -\" \"We can’t worry about that now,\" whispered Hermione. \"It’s you they’re after, Harry, and we’ll just put everyone in even more danger by going back.\" \"She’s right,\" said Ron, who seemed to know that Harry was about to argue, even if he could not see his face. \"Most of the Order was there, they’ll look after everyone.\" Harry nodded, then remembered that they could not see him, and said, \"Yeah.\" But he thought of Ginny, and fear bubbled like acid in his stomach. \"Come on, I think we ought to keep moving,\" said Hermione. They moved back up the side street and onto the main road again, where a group of men on the opposite side was singing and weaving across the pavement. \"Just as a matter of interest, why Tottenham Court Road?\" Ron asked Hermione. \"I’ve no idea, it just popped into my head, but I’m sure we’re safer out in the Muggle world, it’s not where they’ll expect us to be.\" \"True,\" said Ron, looking around, \"but don’t you feel a bit - exposed?\" \"Where else is there?\" asked Hermione, cringing as the men on the other side of the road started wolf-whistling at her. \"We can hardly book rooms at the Leaky Cauldron, can we? And Grimmauld Place is out if Snape can get in there. . . . I suppose we could try my parents’ home, though I think there’s a chance they might check there. . . . Oh, I wish they’d shut up!\" \"All right, darling?\" the drunkest of the men on the other pavement was yelling. \"Fancy a drink? Ditch ginger and come and have a pint!\" \"Let’s sit down somewhere,\" Hermione said hastily as Ron opened his mouth to shout back across the road. \"Look, this will do, in here!\" It was a small and shabby all-night café. A light layer of grease lay on all the Formica-topped tables, but it was at least empty. Harry slipped into a booth first and Ron sat next to him opposite Hermione, who had her back to the entrance and did not like it: She glanced over her shoulder so frequently she appeared to have a twitch. Harry did not like being stationary; walking had given the illusion that they had a goal. Beneath the Cloak he could feel the last vestiges of Polyjuice leaving him, his hands returning to their usual length and shape. He pulled his glasses out of his pocket and put them on again. After a minute or two, Ron said, \"You know, we’re not far from the Leaky Cauldron here, it’s only in Charing Cross -\" \"Ron, we can’t!\" said Hermione at once. \"Not to stay there, but to find out what’s going on!\" \"We know what’s going on! Voldemort’s taken over the Ministry, what else do we need to know?\" \"Okay, okay, it was just an idea!\" They relapsed into a prickly silence. The gum-chewing waitress shuffled over and Hermione ordered two cappuccinos: As Harry was invisible, it would have looked odd to order him one. A pair of burly workmen entered the café and squeezed into the next booth. Hermione dropped her voice to a whisper. \"I say we find a quiet place to Disapparate and head for the countryside. Once we’re there, we could send a message to the Order.\" \"Can you do that talking Patronus thing, then?\" asked Ron. \"I’ve been practicing and I think so,\" said Hermione. \"Well, as long as it doesn’t get them into trouble, though they might’ve been arrested already. God, that’s revolting,\" Ron added after one sip of the foamy, grayish coffee. The waitress had heard; she shot Ron a nasty look as she shuffled off to take the new customers’ orders. The larger of the two workmen, who was blond and quite huge, now that Harry came to look at him, waved her away. She stared, affronted. \"Let’s get going, then, I don’t want to drink this muck,\" said Ron. \"Hermione, have you got Muggle money to pay for this?\" \"Yes, I took out all my Building Society savings before I came to the Burrow. I’ll bet all the change is at the bottom,\" sighed Hermione, reaching for her beaded bag. The two workmen made identical movements, and Harry mirrored them without conscious thought: All three of them drew their wands. Ron, a few seconds late in realizing what was going on, lunged across the table, pushing Hermione sideways onto her bench. The force of the Death Eaters’ spells shattered the tiled wall where Ron’s head had just been, as Harry, still invisible, yelled, \"Stupefy!\" The great blond Death Eater was hit in the face by a jet of red light: He slumped sideways, unconscious. His companion, unable to see who had cast the spell, fired another at Ron: Shining black ropes flew from his wand-tip and bound Ron head to foot - the waitress screamed and ran for the door - Harry sent another Stunning Spell at the Death Eater with the twisted face who had tied up Ron, but the spell missed, rebounded on the window, and hit the waitress, who collapsed in front of the door. \"Expulso!\" bellowed the Death Eater, and the table behind which Harry was standing blew up: The force of the explosion slammed him into the wall and he felt his wand leave his hand as the Cloak slipped off him. \"Petrificus Totalus!\" screamed Hermione from out of sight, and the Death Eater fell forward like a statue to land with a crunching thud on the mess of broken china, table, and coffee. Hermione crawled out from underneath the bench, shaking bits of glass ashtray out of her hair and trembling all over. \"D-diffindo,\" she said, pointing her wand at Ron, who roared in pain as she slashed open the knee of his jeans, leaving a deep cut. \"Oh, I’m so sorry, Ron, my hand’s shaking! Diffindo!\" The severed ropes fell away. Ron got to his feet, shaking his arms to regain feeling in them. Harry picked up his wand and climbed over all the debris to where the large blond Death Eater was sprawled across the bench. \"I should’ve recognized him, he was there the night Dumbledore died,\" he said. He turned over the darker Death Eater with his foot; the man’s eyes moved rapidly between Harry, Ron and Hermione. \"That’s Dolohov,\" said Ron. \"I recognize him from the old wanted posters. I think the big one’s Thorfinn Rowle.\" \"Never mind what they’re called!\" said Hermione a little hysterically. \"How did they find us? What are we going to do?\" Somehow her panic seemed to clear Harry’s head. \"Lock the door,\" he told her, \"and Ron, turn out the lights.\" He looked down at the paralyzed Dolohov, thinking fast as the lock clicked and Ron used the Deluminator to plunge the café into darkness. Harry could hear the men who had jeered at Hermione earlier, yelling at another girl in the distance. \"What are we going to do with them?\" Ron whispered to Harry through the dark; then, even more quietly, \"Kill them? They’d kill us. They had a good go just now.\" Hermione shuddered and took a step backward. Harry shook his head. \"We just need to wipe their memories,\" said Harry. \"It’s better like that, it’ll throw them off the scent. If we killed them it’d be obvious we were here.\" \"You’re the boss,\" said Ron, sounding profoundly relieved. \"But I’ve never down a Memory Charm.\" \"Nor have I,\" said Hermione, \"but I know the theory.\" She took a deep, calming breath, then pointed her wand at Dolohov’s forehead and said, \"Obliviate.\" At once, Dolohov’s eyes became unfocused and dreamy. \"Brilliant!\" said Harry, clapping her on the back. \"Take care of the other one and the waitress while Ron and I clear up.\" \"Clear up?\" said Ron, looking around at the partly destroyed café. \"Why?\" \"Don’t you think they might wonder what’s happened if they wake up and find themselves in a place that looks like it’s just been bombed?\" \"Oh right, yeah . . .\" Ron struggled for a moment before managing to extract his wand from his pocket. \"It’s no wonder I can’t get it out, Hermione, you packed my old jeans, they’re tight.\" \"Oh, I’m so sorry,\" hissed Hermione, and as she dragged the waitress out of sight of the windows, Harry heard her mutter a suggestion as to where Ron could stick his wand instead. Once the café was restored to its previous condition, they heaved the Death Eaters back into their booth and propped them up facing each other. \"But how did they find us?\" Hermione asked, looking from one inert man to the other. \"How did they know where we were?\" She turned to Harry. \"You - you don’t think you’ve still got your Trace on you, do you, Harry?\" \"He can’t have,\" said Ron. \"The Trace breaks at seventeen, that’s Wizarding law, you can’t put it on an adult.\" \"As far as you know,\" said Hermione. \"What if the Death Eaters have found a way to put it on a seventeen-year-old?\" \"But Harry hasn’t been near a Death Eater in the last twenty-four hours. Who’s supposed to have put a Trace back on him?\" Hermione did not reply. Harry felt contaminated, tainted: Was that really how the Death Eaters had found them? \"If I can’t use magic, and you can’t use magic near me, without us giving away our position - \" he began. \"We’re not splitting up!\" said Hermione firmly. \"We need a safe place to hide,\" said Ron. \"Give us time to think things through.\" \"Grimmauld Place,\" said Harry. The other two gaped. \"Don’t be silly, Harry, Snape can get in there!\" \"Ron’s dad said they’ve put up jinxes against him - and even if they haven’t worked,\" he pressed on as Hermione began to argue \"so what? I swear, I’d like nothing better than to meet Snape!\" \"But -\" \"Hermione, where else is there? It’s the best chance we’ve got. Snape’s only one Death Eater. If I’ve still got the Trace on me, we’ll have whole crowds of them on us wherever else we go.\" She could not argue, though she looked as if she would have liked to. While she unlocked the café door, Ron clicked the Deluminator to release the café’s light. Then, on Harry’s count of three, they reversed the spells upon their three victims, and before the waitress or either of the Death Eaters could do more than stir sleepily, Harry, Ron and Hermione had turned on the spot and vanished into the compressing darkness once more. Seconds later Harry’s lungs expanded gratefully and he opened his eyes: They were now standing in the middle of a familiar small and shabby square. Tall, dilapidated houses looked down on them from every side. Number twelve was visible to them, for they had been told of its existence by Dumbledore, its Secret-Keeper, and they rushed toward it, checking every few yards that they were not being followed or observed. They raced up the stone steps, and Harry tapped the front door once with his wand. They heard a series of metallic clicks and the clatter of a chain, then the door swung open with a creak and they hurried over the threshold. As Harry closed the door behind them, the old-fashioned gas lamps sprang into life, casting flickering light along the length of the hallway. It looked just as Harry remembered it: eerie, cobwebbed, the outlines of the house-elf heads on the wall throwing odd shadows up the staircase. Long dark curtains concealed the portrait of Sirius’s mother. The only thing that was out of place was the troll’s leg umbrella stand, which was lying on its side as if Tonks had just knocked it over again. \"I think somebody’s been in here,\" Hermione whispered, pointing toward it. \"That could’ve happened as the Order left,\" Ron murmured back. \"So where are these jinxes they put up against Snape?\" Harry asked. \"Maybe they’re only activated if he shows up?\" suggested Ron. Yet they remained close together on the doormat, backs against the door, scared to move farther into the house. \"Well, we can’t stay here forever,\" said Harry, and he took a step forward. \"Severus Snape?\" Mad-Eye Moody’s voice whispered out of the darkness, making all three of them jump back in fright. \"We’re not Snape!\" croaked Harry, before something whooshed over him like cold air and his tongue curled backward on itself, making it impossible to speak. Before he had time to feel inside his mouth, however, his tongue had unraveled again. The other two seemed to have experienced the same unpleasant sensation. Ron was making retching noises; Hermione stammered, \"That m-must have b-been the T-Tongue-Tying Curse Mad-Eye set up for Snape!\" Gingerly Harry took another step forward. Something shifted in the shadows at the end of the hall, and before any of them could say another word, a figure had risen up out of the carpet, tall, dust-colored, and terrible; Hermione screamed and so did Mrs. Black, her curtains flying open; the gray figure was gliding toward them, faster and faster, its waist-length hair and beard streaming behind it, its face sunken, fleshless, with empty eye sockets: Horribly familiar, dreadfully altered, it raised a wasted arm, pointing at Harry. \"No!\" Harry shouted, and though he had raised his wand no spell occurred to him. \"No! It wasn’t us! We didn’t kill you -\" On the word kill, the figure exploded in a great cloud of dust: Coughing, his eyes watering, Harry looked around to see Hermione crouched on the floor by the door with her arms over her head, and Ron, who was shaking from head to foot, patting her clumsily on the shoulder and saying, \"It’s all r-right. . . . It’s g-gone. . . .\" Dust swirled around Harry like mist, catching the blue gaslight, as Mrs. Black continued to scream. \"Mudbloods, filth, stains of dishonor, taint of shame on the house of my fathers -\" \"SHUT UP!\" Harry bellowed, directing his wand at her, and with a bang and a burst of red sparks, the curtains swung shut again, silencing her. \"That . . . that was . . . \" Hermione whimpered, as Ron helped her to her feet. \"Yeah,\" said Harry, \"but it wasn’t really him, was it? Just something to scare Snape.\" Had it worked, Harry wondered, or had Snape already blasted the horror-figure aside as casually as he had killed the real Dumbledore? Nerves still tingling, he led the other two up the hall, half-expecting some new terror to reveal itself, but nothing moved except for a mouse skittering along the skirting board. \"Before we go any farther, I think we’d better check,\" whispered Hermione, and she raised her wand and said, \"Homenum revelio.\" Nothing happened. \"Well, you’ve just had a big shock,\" said Ron kindly. \"What was that supposed to do?\" \"It did what I meant it to do!\" said Hermione rather crossly. \"That was a spell to reveal human presence, and there’s nobody here except us!\" \"And old Dusty,\" said Ron, glancing at the patch of carpet from which the corpse-figure had risen. \"Let’s go up,\" said Hermione with a frightened look at the same spot, and she led the way up the creaking stairs to the drawing room on the first floor. Hermione waved her wand to ignite the old gas lamps, then, shivering slightly in the drafty room, she perched on the sofa, her arms wrapped tightly around her. Ron crossed to the window and moved the heavy velvet curtains aside an inch. \"Can’t see anyone out there,\" he reported. \"And you’d think, if Harry still had a Trace on him, they’d have followed us here. I know they can’t get in the house, but - what’s up, Harry?\" Harry had given a cry of pain: His scar had burned against as something flashed across his mind like a bright light on water. He saw a large shadow and felt a fury that was not his own pound through his body, violent and brief as an electric shock. \"What did you see?\" Ron asked, advancing on Harry. \"Did you see him at my place?\" \"No, I just felt anger - he’s really angry -\" \"But that could be at the Burrow,\" said Ron loudly. \"What else? Didn’t you see anything? Was he cursing someone?\" \"No, I just felt anger - I couldn’t tell -\" Harry felt badgered, confused, and Hermione did not help as she said in a frightened voice, \"Your scar, again? But what’s going on? I thought that connection had closed!\" \"It did, for a while,\" muttered Harry; his scar was still painful, which made it hard to concentrate. \"I - I think it’s started opening again whenever he loses control, that’s how it used to -\" \"But then you’ve got to close your mind!\" said Hermione shrilly. \"Harry, Dumbledore didn’t want you to use that connection, he wanted you to shut it down, that’s why you were supposed to use Occlumency! Otherwise Voldemort can plant false images in your mind, remember -\" \"Yeah, I do remember, thanks,\" said Harry through gritted teeth; he did not need Hermione to tell him that Voldemort had once used this selfsame connection between them to lead him into a trap, nor that it had resulted in Sirius’s death. He wished that he had not told them what he had seen and felt; it made Voldemort more threatening, as though he were pressing against the window of the room, and still the pain in his scar was building and he fought it: It was like resisting the urge to be sick. He turned his back on Ron and Hermione, pretending to examine the old tapestry of the Black family tree on the wall. Then Hermione shrieked: Harry drew his wand again and spun around to see a silver Patronus soar through the drawing room window and land upon the floor in front of them, where it solidified into the weasel that spoke with the voice of Ron’s father. \"Family safe, do not reply, we are being watched.\" The Patronus dissolved into nothingness. Ron let out a noise between a whimper and a groan and dropped onto the sofa: Hermione joined him, gripping his arm. \"They’re all right, they’re all right!\" she whispered, and Ron half laughed and hugged her. \"Harry,\" he said over Hermione’s shoulder, \"I -\" \"It’s not a problem,\" said Harry, sickened by the pain in his head. \"It’s your family, ‘course you were worried. I’d feel the same way.\" He thought of Ginny. \"I do feel the same way.\" The pain in his scar was reaching a peak, burning as it had back in the garden of the Burrow. Faintly he heard Hermione say \"I don’t want to be on my own. Could we use the sleeping bags I’ve brought and camp in here tonight?\" He heard Ron agree. He could not fight the pain much longer. He had to succumb. \"Bathroom,\" he muttered, and he left the room as fast as he could without running. He barely made it: Bolting the door behind him with trembling hands, he grasped his pounding head and fell to the floor, then in an explosion of agony, he felt the rage that did not belong to him possess his soul, saw a long room lit only by firelight, and the giant blond Death Eater on the floor, screaming and writhing, and a slighter figure standing over him, wand outstretched, while Harry spoke in a high, cold, merciless voice. \"More, Rowle, or shall we end it and feed you to Nagini? Lord Voldemort is not sure that he will forgive this time. . . . You called me back for this, to tell me that Harry Potter has escaped again? Draco, give Rowle another taste of our displeasure. . . . Do it, or feel my wrath yourself!\" A log fell in the fire: Flames reared, their light darting across a terrified, pointed white face - with a sense of emerging from deep water, Harry drew heaving breaths and opened his eyes. He was spread-eagled on the cold black marble floor, his nose inches from one of the silver serpent tails that supported the large bathtub. He sat up. Malfoy’s gaunt, petrified face seemed burned on the inside of his eyes. Harry felt sickened by what he had seen, by the use to which Draco was now being put by Voldemort. There was a sharp rap on the door, and Harry jumped as Hermione’s voice rang out. \"Harry, do you want your toothbrush? I’ve got it here.\" \"Yeah, great, thanks,\" he said, fighting to keep his voice casual as he stood up to let her in. \n",

            "-Four The Forest Again Finally, the truth. Lying with his face pressed into the dusty carpet of the office where he had once thought he was learning the secrets of victory, Harry understood at last that he was not supposed to survive. His job was to walk calmly into Death’s welcoming arms. Along the way, he was to dispose of Voldemort’s remaining links to life, so that when at last he flung himself across Voldemort’s path, and did not raise a wand to defend himself, the end would be clean, and the job that ought to have been done in Godric’s Hollow would be finished. Neither would live, neither could survive. He felt his heart pounding fiercely in his chest. How strange that in his dread of death, it pumped all the harder, valiantly keeping him alive. But it would have to stop, and soon. Its beats were numbered. How many would there be time for, as he rose and walked through the castle for the last time, out into the grounds and into the forest? Terror washed over him as he lay on the floor, with that funeral drum pounding inside him. Would it hurt to die? All those times he had thought that it was about to happen and escaped, he had never really thought of the thing itself: His will to live had always been so much stronger than his fear of death. Yet it did not occur to him now to try to escape, to outrun Voldemort. It was over, he knew it, and all that was left was the thing itself: dying. If he could only have died on that summer’s night when he had left number four, Privet Drive, for the last time, when the noble phoenix feather wand had saved him! If he could only have died like Hedwig, so quickly he would not have known it had happened! Or if he could have launched himself in front of a wand to save someone he loved . . . He envied even his parents’ deaths now. This cold-blooded walk to his own destruction would require a different kind of bravery. He felt his fingers trembling slightly and made an effort to control them, although no one could see him; the portraits on the walls were all empty. Slowly, very slowly, he sat up, and as he did so he felt more alive and more aware of his own living body than ever before. Why had he never appreciated what a miracle he was, brain and nerve and bounding heart? It would all be gone . . . or at least, he would be gone from it. His breath came slow and deep, and his mouth and throat were completely dry, but so were his eyes. Dumbledore’s betrayal was almost nothing. Of course there had been a bigger plan: Harry had simply been too foolish to see it, he realized that now. He had never questioned his own assumption that Dumbledore wanted him alive. Now he saw that his life span had always been determined by how long it took to eliminate all the Horcruxes. Dumbledore had passed the job of destroying them to him, and obediently he had continued to chip away at the bonds tying not only Voldemort, but himself, to life! How neat, how elegant, not to waste any more lives, but to give the dangerous task to the boy who had already been marked for slaughter, and whose death would not be a calamity, but another blow against Voldemort. And Dumbledore had known that Harry would not duck out, that he would keep going to the end, even though it was his end, because he had taken trouble to get to know him, hadn’t he? Dumbledore knew, as Voldemort knew, that Harry would not let anyone else die for him now that he had discovered it was in his power to stop it. The images of Fred, Lupin, and Tonks lying dead in the Great Hall forced their way back into his mind’s eye, and for a moment he could hardly breathe. Death was impatient . . . But Dumbledore had overestimated him. He had failed: The snake survived. One Horcrux remained to bind Voldemort to the earth, even after Harry had been killed. True, that would mean an easier job for somebody. He wondered who would do it . . . Ron and Hermione would know what needed to be done, of course . . . That would have been why Dumbledore wanted him to confide in two others . . . so that if he fulfilled his true destiny a little early, they could carry on . . . Like rain on a cold window, these thoughts pattered against the hard surface of the incontrovertible truth, which was that he must die. I must die. It must end. Ron and Hermione seemed a long way away, in a far-off country; he felt as though he had parted from them long ago. There would be no good-byes and no explanations, he was determined of that. This was a journey they could not take together, and the attempts they would make to stop him would waste valuable time. He looked down at the battered gold watch he had received on his seventeenth birthday. Nearly half of the hour allotted by Voldemort for his surrender had elapsed. He stood up. His heart was leaping against his ribs like a frantic bird. Perhaps it knew it had little time left, perhaps it was determined to fulfill a lifetime’s beats before the end. He did not look back as he closed the office door. The castle was empty. He felt ghostly striding through it alone, as if he had already died. The portrait people were still missing from their frames; the whole place was eerily still, as if all its remaining lifeblood were concentrated in the Great Hall where the dead and the mourners were crammed. Harry pulled the Invisibility Cloak over himself and descended through the floors, at last walking down the marble staircase into the entrance hall. Perhaps some tiny part of him hoped to be sensed, to be seen, to be stopped, but the Cloak was, as ever, impenetrable, perfect, and he reached the front doors easily. Then Neville nearly walked into him. He was one half of a pair that was carrying a body in from the grounds. Harry glanced down and felt another dull blow to his stomach: Colon Creevey, though underage, must have sneaked back just as Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had done. He was tiny in death. \"You know what? I can manage him alone, Neville,\" said Oliver Wood, and he heaved Colin over his shoulder in a fireman’s lift and carried him into the Great Hall. Neville leaned against the door frame for a moment and wiped his forehead with the back of his hand. He looked like an old man. Then he set off on the steps again into the darkness to recover more bodies. Harry took one glance back at the entrance of the Great Hall. People were moving around, trying to comfort each other, drinking, kneeling beside the dead, but he could not see any of the people he loved, no hint of Hermione, Ron, Ginny, or any of the other Weasleys, no Luna. He felt he would have given all the time remaining to him for just one last look at them; but then, would he ever have the strength to stop looking? It was better like this. He moved down the steps and out into the darkness. It was nearly four in the morning, and the deathly stillness of the grounds felt as though they were holding their breath, waiting to see whether he could do what he must. Harry moved toward Neville, who was bending over another body. \"Neville.\" \"Blimey, Harry, you nearly gave me heart failure!\" Harry had pulled off the Cloak: The idea had come to him out of nowhere, born out of a desire to make absolutely sure. \"Where are you going, alone?\" Neville asked suspiciously. \"It’s all part of the plan,\" said Harry. \"There’s someting I’ve got to do. Listen --- Neville ---\" \"Harry!\" Neville looked suddenly scared. \"Harry, you’re not thinking of handing yourself over?\" \"No,\" Harry lied easily. \"’Course not . . . this is something else. But I might be out of sight for a while. You know Voldemort’s snake. Neville? He’s got a huge snake . . . Calls it Nagini . . .\" \"I’ve heard, yeah . . . What about it?\" \"It’s got to be killed. Ron and Hermione know that, but just in case they ---\" The awfulness of that possibility smothered him for a moment, made it impossible to keep talking. But he pulled himself together again: This was crucial, he must be like Dumbledore, keep a cool head, make sure there were backups, others to carry on. Dumbledore had died knowing that three people still knew about the Horcruxes; now Neville would take Harry’s place: There would still be three in the secret. \"Just in case they’re --- busy --- and you get the chance ---\" \"Kill the snake?\" \"Kill the snake,\" Harry repeated. \"All right, Harry. You’re okay, are you?\" \"I’m fine. Thanks, Neville.\" But Neville seized his wrist as Harry made to move on. \"We’re all going to keep fighting, Harry. You know that?\" \"Yeah, I ---\" The suffocating feeling extinguished the end of the sentence; he could not go on. Neville did not seem to find it strange. He patted Harry on the shoulder, released him, and walked away to look for more bodies. Harry swung the Cloak back over himself and walked on. Someone else was moving not far away, stooping over another prone figure on the ground. He was feet away from her when he realized it was Ginny. He stopped in his tracks. She was crouching over a girl who was whispering for her mother. \"It’s all right,\" Ginny was saying. \"It’s ok. We’re going to get you inside.\" \"But I want to go home,\" whispered the girl. \"I don’t want to fight anymore!\" \"I know,\" said Ginny, and her voice broke. \"It’s going to be all right.\" Ripples of cold undulated over Harry’s skin. He wanted to shout out to the night, he wanted Ginny to know that he was there, he wanted her to know where he was going. He wanted to be stopped, to be dragged back, to be sent back home. . . . But he was home. Hogwards was the first and best home he had known. He and Voldemort and Snape, the abandoned boys, had all found home here. . . . Ginny was kneeling beside the injured girl now, holding her hand. With a huge effort Harry forced himself on. He thought he saw Ginny look around as he passed, and wondered whether she had sensed someone walking nearby, but he did not speak, and he did not look back. Hagrid’s hut loomed out of the darkness. There were no lights, no sound of Fang scrabbling at the door, his bark booming in welcome. All those visits to Hagrid, and the gleam of the copper kettle on the fire, and rock cakes and giant grubs, and his great bearded face, and Ron vomiting slugs, and Hermione helping him save Norbert . . . He moved on, and now he reached the edge of the forest, and he stopped. A swarm of dementors was gliding amongst the trees; he could feel their chill, and he was not sure he would be able to pass safely through it. He had not strength left for a Patronus. He could no longer control his own trembling. It was not, after all, so easy to die. Every second he breathed, the smell of the grass, the cool air on his face, was so precious: To think that people had years and years, time to waste, so much time it dragged, and he was clinging to each second. At the same time he thought that he would not be able to go on, and knew that he must. The long game was ended, the Snitch had been caught, it was time to leave the air. . . . The Snitch. His nerveless fingers fumbled for a moment with the pouch at his neck and he pulled it out. I open at the close. Breathing fast and hard, he stared down at it. Now that he wanted time to move as slowly as possible, he seemed to have sped up, and understanding was coming so fast it seemed to have bypassed though. This was the close. This was the moment. He pressed the golden metal to his lips and whispered, \"I am about to die.\" The metal shell broke open. He lowered his shaking hand, raised Draco’s wand beneath the Cloak, and murmured, \"Lumos.\" The black stone with is jagged crack running down the center sat in the two halves of the Snitch. The Resurrection Stone had cracked down the vertical line representing the Elder Wand. The triangle and circle representing the Cloak and the stone were still discernible. And again Harry understood without having to think. It did not matter about bringing them back, for he was about to join them. He was not really fetching them: They were fetching him. He closed his eyes and turned the stone over in his hand three times. He knew it had happened, because he heard slight movements around him that suggested frail bodies shifting their footing on the earthy, twig-strewn ground that marked the outer edge of the forest. He opened his eyes and looked around. They were neither ghost nor truly flesh, he could see that. They resembled most closely the Riddle that had escaped from the diary so long ago, and he had been memory made nearly solid. Less substantial than living bodies, but much more than ghosts, they moved toward him. And on each face, there was the same loving smile. James was exactly the same height as Harry. He was wearing the clothes in which he had died, and his hair was untidy and ruffled, and his glasses were a little lopsided, like Mr. Weasley’s. Sirius was tall and handsome, and younger by far than Harry had seen him in life. He loped with an easy grace, his hands in his pockets and a grin on his face. Lupin was younger too, and much less shabby, and his hair was thicker and darker. He looked happy to be back in this familiar place, scene of so many adolescent wanderings. Lily’s smile was widest of all. She pushed her long hair back as she drew closer to him, and her green eyes, so like his, searched his face hungrily, as though she would never be able to look at him enough. \"You’ve been so brave.\" He could not speak. His eyes feasted on her, and he thought that he would like to stand and look at her forever, and that would be enough. \"You are nearly there,\" said James. \"Very close. We are . . . so proud of you.\" \"Does it hurt?\" The childish question had fallen from Harry’s lips before he could stop it. \"Dying? Not at all,\" said Sirius. \"Quicker and easier than falling asleep.\" \"And he will want it to be quick. He wants it over,\" said Lupin. \"I didn’t want you to die,\" Harry said. These words came without his volition. \"Any of you. I’m sorry ---\" He addressed Lupin more than any of them, beseeching him. \"--- right after you’d had your son . . . Remus, I’m sorry ---\" \"I am sorry too,\" said Lupin. \"Sorry I will never know him . . . but he will know why I died and I hope he will understand. I was trying to make a world in which he could live a happier life.\" A chilly breeze that seemed to emanate from the heart of the forest lifted the hair at Harry’s brow. He knew that they would not tell him to go, that it would have to be his decision. \"You’ll stay with me?\" \"Until the very end,\" said James. \"They won’t be able to see you?\" asked Harry. \"We are part of you,\" said Sirius. \"Invisible to anyone else.\" Harry looked at his mother. \"Stay close to me,\" he said quietly. And he set of. The dementors’ chill did not overcome him; he passed through it with his companions, and they acted like Patronuses to him, and together they marched through the old trees that grew closely together, their branches tangled, their roots gnarled and twisted underfoot. Harry clutched the Cloak tightly around him in the darkness, traveling deeper and deeper into the forest, with no idea where exactly Voldemort was, but sure that he would find him. Beside him, making scarcely a sound, walked James, Sirius, Lupin, and Lily, and their presence was his courage, and the reason he was able to keep putting one foot in front of the other. His body and mind felt oddly disconnected now, his limbs working without conscious instruction, as if he were passenger, not driver, in the body he was about to leave. The dead who walked beside him through the forest were much more real to him now than the living back at the castle: Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and all the others were the ones who felt like ghosts as he stumbled and slipped toward the end of his life, toward Voldemort . . . A thud and a whisper: Some other living creature had stirred close by. Harry stopped under the Cloak, peering around, listening, and his mother and father, Lupin and Sirius stopped too. \"Someone there,\" came a rough whisper close at hand. \"He’s got an Invisibility Cloak. Could it be --- ?\" Two figures emerged from behind a nearby tree: Their wands flared, and Harry saw Yaxley and Dolohov peering into the darkness, directly at the place Harry, his mother and father and Sirius and Lupin stood. Apparently they could not see anything. \"Definitely heard something,\" said Yaxley. \"Animal, d’you reckon?\" \"That head case Hagrid kept a whole bunch of stuff in here,\" said Dolohov, glancing over his shoulder. Yaxley looked down at his watch. \"Time’s nearly up. Porter’s had his hour. He’s not coming.\" \"Better go back,\" said Yaxley. \"Find out what the plan is now.\" He and Dolohov turned and walked deeper into the forest. Harry followed them, knowing that they would lead him exactly where he wanted to go. He glanced sideways, and his mother smiled at him, and his father nodded encouragement. They had traveled on mere minutes when Harry saw light ahead, and Yaxley and Dolohov stepped out into a clearing that Harry knew had been the place where the monstrous Aragog had once lived. The remnants of his vast web were there still, but the swarms of descendants he had spawned had been driven out by the Death Eaters, to fight for their cause. A fire burned in the middle of the clearing, and its flickering light fell over a crowd of completely silent, watchful Death Eaters. Some of them were still masked and hooded; others showed their faces. Two giants sat on the outskirts of the group, casting massive shadows over the scene, their faces cruel, rough-hewn like rock. Harry saw Fenrir, skulking, chewing his long nails; the great blond Rowle was dabbing at his bleeding lip. He saw Lucius Malfoy, who looked defeated and terrified, and Narcissa, whose eyes were sunken and full of apprehension. Every eye was fixed upon Voldemort, who stood with his head bowed, and his white hands folded over the Elder Wand in front of him. He might have been praying, or else counting silently in his mind, and Harry, standing still on the edge of the scene, though absurdly of a child counting in a game of hide-and-seek. Behind his head, still swirling and coiling, the great snake Nagini floated in her glittering, charmed cage, like a monstrous halo. When Dolohov and Yaxley rejoined the circle, Voldemort looked up. \"No sign of him, my Lord,\" said Dolohov. Voldemort’s expression did not change. The red eyes seemed to burn in the firelight. Slowly he drew the Elder Wand between his long fingers. \"My Lord ---\" Bellatrix had spoken: She sat closest to Voldemort, disheveled, her face a little bloody but otherwise unharmed. Voldemort raised his hand to silence her, and she did not speak another word, but eyed him in worshipful fascination. \"I thought he would come,\" said Voldemort in his high, clear voice, his eyes on the leaping flames. \"I expected him to come.\" Nobody spoke. They seemed as scared as Harry, whose heart was now throwing itself against his ribs as though determined to escape the body he was about to cast aside. His hands were sweating as he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak and stuffed it beneath his robes, with his wand. He did not want to be tempted to fight. \"I was, it seems . . . mistaken,\" said Voldemort. \"You weren’t.\" Harry said it as loudly as he could, with all the force he could muster: He did not want to sound afraid. The Resurrection Stone slipped from between his numb fingers, and out of the corner of his eyes he saw his parents, Sirius, and Lupin vanish as he stepped forward into the firelight. At that moment he felt that nobody mattered but Voldemort. It was just the two of them. The illusion was gone as soon as it had come. The giants roared as the Death Eaters rose together, and there were many cries, gasps, even laughter. Voldemort had frozen where he stood, but his red eyes had found Harry, and he stared as Harry moved toward him, with nothing but the fire between them. Then a voice yelled: \"HARRY! NO!\" He turned: Hagrid was bound and trussed, tied to a tree nearby. His massive body shook the branches overhead as he struggled, desperate. \"NO! NO! HARRY, WHAT’RE YEH --- ?\" \"QUIET!\" shouted Rowle, and with a flick of his wand, Hagrid was silenced. Bellatrix, who had leapt to her feet, was looking eagerly from Voldemort to Harry, her breast heaving. The only things that moved were the flames and the snake, coiling and uncoiling in the glittering cage behind Voldemort’s head. Harry could feel his wand against his chest, but he made no attempt to draw it. He knew that the snake was too well protected, knew that if he managed to point the wand at Nagini, fifty curses would hit him first. And still, Voldemort and Harry looked at each other, and now Voldemort tilted his head a little to the side, considering the boy standing before him, and a singularly mirthless smile curled the lipless mouth. \"Harry Potter,\" he said very softly. His voice might have been part of the spitting fire. \"The Boy Who Lived.\" None of the Death Eaters moved. They were waiting: Everything was waiting. Hagrid was struggling, and Bellatrix was panting, and Harry thought inexplicably of Ginny, and her blazing look, and the feel of her lips on his --- Voldemort had raised his wand. His head was still tilted to one side, like a curious child, wondering what would happen if he proceeded. Harry looked back into the red eyes, and wanted it to happen now, quickly, while he could still stand, before he lost control, before he betrayed fear --- He saw the mouth move and a flash of green light, and everything was gone. \n",
