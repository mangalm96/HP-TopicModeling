              "'pm “We can actually meet him!” Hermione squealed. “I mean, he’s written almost the whole booklist!” The crowd seemed to be made up mostly of witches around Mrs Weasley’s age. A harassed-looking wizard stood at the door, saying, “Calmly, please ladies … don’t push, there … mind the books, now …” Harry, Ron and Hermione squeezed inside. A long queue wound right to the back of the shop, where Gilderoy Lockhart was signing his books. They each grabbed a copy of Break with a Banshee, and sneaked up the line to where the rest of the Weasleys were standing with Mr and Mrs Granger. “Oh, there you are, good,” said Mrs Weasley. She sounded breathless and kept patting her hair. “We’ll be able to see him in a minute …” Gilderoy Lockhart came slowly into view, seated at a table surrounded by large pictures of his own face, all winking and flashing dazzlingly white teeth at the crowd. The real Lockhart was wearing robes of forget-me-not blue which exactly matched his eyes; his pointed wizard’s hat was set at a jaunty angle on his wavy hair. A short, irritable-looking man was dancing around taking photographs with a large black camera that emitted puffs of purple smoke with every blinding flash. “Out of the way, there,” he snarled at Ron, moving back to get a better shot. “This is for the Daily Prophet.” “Big deal,” said Ron, rubbing his foot where the photographer had stepped on it. Gilderoy Lockhart heard him. He looked up. He saw Ron – and then he saw Harry. He stared. Then he leapt to his feet and positively shouted, “It can’t be Harry Potter?” The crowd parted, whispering excitedly. Lockhart dived forward, seized Harry’s arm and pulled him to the front. The crowd burst into applause. Harry’s face burned as Lockhart shook his hand for the photographer, who was clicking away madly, wafting thick smoke over the Weasleys. “Nice big smile, Harry,” said Lockhart, through his own gleaming teeth. “Together, you and I are worth the front page.” When he finally let go of Harry’s hand, Harry could hardly feel his fingers. He tried to sidle back over to the Weasleys, but Lockhart threw an arm around his shoulders and clamped him tightly to his side. “Ladies and gentlemen,” he said loudly, waving for quiet. “What an extraordinary moment this is! The perfect moment for me to make a little announcement I’ve been sitting on for some time! “When young Harry here stepped into Flourish and Blotts today, he only wanted to buy my autobiography – which I shall be happy to present him now, free of charge –” the crowd applauded again, “– he had no idea,” Lockhart continued, giving Harry a little shake that made his glasses slip to the end of his nose, “that he would shortly be getting much, much more than my book, Magical Me. He and his school fellows will, in fact, be getting the real, magical me. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I have great pleasure and pride in announcing that, this September, I will be taking up the post of Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!” The crowd cheered and clapped and Harry found himself being presented with the entire works of Gilderoy Lockhart. Staggering slightly under their weight, he managed to make his way out of the limelight to the edge of the room, where Ginny was standing next to her new cauldron. “You have these,” Harry mumbled to her, tipping the books into the cauldron. “I’ll buy my own –” “Bet you loved that, didn’t you, Potter?” said a voice Harry had no trouble recognising. He straightened up and found himself face to face with Draco Malfoy, who was wearing his usual sneer. “Famous Harry Potter,” said Malfoy. “Can’t even go into a bookshop without making the front page.” “Leave him alone, he didn’t want all that!” said Ginny. It was the first time she had spoken in front of Harry. She was glaring at Malfoy. “Potter, you’ve got yourself a girlfriend!” drawled Malfoy. Ginny went scarlet as Ron and Hermione fought their way over, both clutching stacks of Lockhart’s books. “Oh, it’s you,” said Ron, looking at Malfoy as if he were something unpleasant on the sole of his shoe. “Bet you’re surprised to see Harry here, eh?” “Not as surprised as I am to see you in a shop, Weasley,” retorted Malfoy. “I suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for that lot.” Ron went as red as Ginny. He dropped his books into the cauldron, too, and started towards Malfoy, but Harry and Hermione grabbed the back of his jacket. “Ron!” said Mr Weasley, struggling over with Fred and George. “What are you doing? It’s mad in here, let’s go outside.” “Well, well, well – Arthur Weasley.” It was Mr Malfoy. He stood with his hand on Draco’s shoulder, sneering in just the same way. “Lucius,” said Mr Weasley, nodding coldly. “Busy time at the Ministry, I hear,” said Mr Malfoy. “All those raids … I hope they’re paying you overtime?” He reached into Ginny’s cauldron and extracted, from amidst the glossy Lockhart books, a very old, very battered copy of A Beginner’s Guide to Transfiguration. “Obviously not,” he said. “Dear me, what’s the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don’t even pay you well for it?” Mr Weasley flushed darker than either Ron or Ginny. “We have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy,” he said. “Clearly,” said Mr Malfoy, his pale eyes straying to Mr and Mrs Granger, who were watching apprehensively. “The company you keep, Weasley … and I thought your family could sink no lower –” There was a thud of metal as Ginny’s cauldron went flying; Mr Weasley had thrown himself at Mr Malfoy, knocking him backwards into a bookshelf. Dozens of heavy spellbooks came thundering down on all their heads; there was a yell of “Get him, Dad!” from Fred or George; Mrs Weasley was shrieking, “No, Arthur, no!”; the crowd stampeded backwards, knocking more shelves over; “Gentlemen, please – please!” cried the assistant and then, louder than all, “Break it up, there, gents, break it up –” Hagrid was wading towards them through the sea of books. In an instant he had pulled Mr Weasley and Mr Malfoy apart. Mr Weasley had a cut lip and Mr Malfoy had been hit in the eye by an Encyclopedia of Toadstools. He was still holding Ginny’s old transfiguration book. He thrust it at her, his eyes glittering with malice. “Here, girl – take your book – it’s the best your father can give you –” Pulling himself out of Hagrid’s grip he beckoned to Draco and swept from the shop. “Yeh should’ve ignored him, Arthur,” said Hagrid, almost lifting Mr Weasley off his feet as he straightened his robes. “Rotten ter the core, the whole family, everyone knows that. No Malfoy’s worth listenin’ ter. Bad blood, that’s what it is. Come on now – let’s get outta here.” The assistant looked as though he wanted to stop them leaving, but he barely came up to Hagrid’s waist and seemed to think better of it. They hurried up the street, the Grangers shaking with fright and Mrs Weasley beside herself with fury. “A fine example to set to your children … brawling in public … what Gilderoy Lockhart must’ve thought …” “He was pleased,” said Fred. “Didn’t you hear him as we were leaving? He was asking that bloke from the Daily Prophet if he’d be able to work the fight into his report – said it was all publicity.” But it was a subdued group who headed back to the fireside in the Leaky Cauldron, where Harry, the Weasleys and all their shopping would be travelling back to The Burrow using Floo powder. They said goodbye to the Grangers, who were leaving the pub for the Muggle street on the other side. Mr Weasley started to ask them how bus stops worked, but stopped quickly at the look on Mrs Weasley’s face. Harry took off his glasses and put them safely in his pocket before helping himself to Floo powder. It definitely wasn’t his favourite way to travel. '"

            " THIRTY-FIVE Beyond the Veil Black shapes were emerging out of thin air all around them, blocking their way left and right; eyes glinted through slits in hoods, a dozen lit wand tips were pointing directly at their hearts; Ginny gave a gasp of horror. \"To me, Potter,\" repeated the drawling voice of Lucius Malfoy as he held out his hand, palm up. Harrys insides plummeted sickeningly. They were trapped, and outnumbered two to one. \"To me,\" said Malfoy yet again. \"Where’s Sirius?\" Harry said. Several of the Death Eaters laughed; a harsh female voice from the midst of the shadowy figures to Harry’s left said triumphantly, \"The Dark Lord always knows!\" \"Always,\" echoed Malfoy softly. \"Now, give me the prophecy Potter.\" \"I want to know where Sirius is!\" \"I want to know where Sirius is!\" mimicked the woman to his left. She and her fellow Death Eaters had closed in so that they were mere feet away from Harry and the others, the light from their wands dazzling Harry’s eyes. \"You’ve got him,\" said Harry, ignoring the rising panic in his chest, the dread he had been fighting since they had first entered the ninety-seventh row. \"He’s here. I know he is.\" \"The little baby woke up fwightened and fort what it dweamed was twoo,\" said the woman in a horrible, mock baby voice. Harry felt Ron stir beside him. \"Don’t do anything,\" Harry muttered. \"Not yet -\" The woman who had mimicked him let out a raucous scream of laughter. \"You hear him? You hear him? Giving instructions to the other children as though he thinks of fighting us!\" \"Oh, you don’t know Potter as I do, Bellatrix,\" said Malfoy softly. \"He has a great weakness for heroics; the Dark Lord understands this about him. Now give me the prophecy, Potter.\" \"I know Sirius is here,\" said Harry, though panic w as causing his chest to constrict and he felt as though he could not breathe properly. \"I know you’ve got him!\" More of the Death Eaters laughed, though the woman laughed loudest of all. \"It’s time you learned the difference between life and dreams, Potter,\" said Malfoy. \"Now give me the prophecy, or we start using wands.\" \"Go on, then,\" said Harry, raising his own wand to chest height. As he did so, the five wands of Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny and Luna rose on either side of him. The knot in Harry’s stomach tightened. If Sirius really was not here, he had led his friends to their deaths for no reason at all... But the Death Eaters did not strike. \"Hand over the prophecy and no one need get hurt,\" said Malfoy coolly. It was Harry’s turn to laugh. \"Yeah, right!\" he said. \"I give you this - prophecy, is it? And you’ll just let us skip off home, will you?\" The words were hardly out of his mouth when the female Death Eater shrieked: \"Accio proph--\" Harry was just ready for her: he shouted \"Protego!\" before she had finished her spell, and though the glass sphere slipped to the tips of his fingers he managed to cling on to it. \"Oh, he knows how to play, little bitty baby Potter,\" she said, her mad eyes staring through the slits in her hood. \"Very well, then -\" \"I TOLD YOU, NO!\" Lucius Malfoy roared at the woman. \"If you smash it -!\" Harry’s mind was racing. The Death Eaters wanted this dusty spun-glass sphere. He had no interest in it. He just wanted to get them all out of this alive, to make sure none of his friends paid a terrible price for his stupidity... The woman stepped forward, away from her fellows, and pulled off her hood. Azkaban had hollowed Bellatrix Lestrange’s face, making it gaunt and skull-like, but it was alive with a feverish, fanatical glow. \"You need more persuasion?\" she said, her chest rising and falling rapidly. \"Very well - take the smallest one,\" she ordered the Death Eaters beside her. \"Let him watch while we torture the little girl. I’ll do it.\" Harry felt the others close in around Ginny; he stepped sideways so that he was right in front of her, the prophecy held up to his chest. \"You’ll have to smash this if you want to attack any of us,\" he told Bellatrix. \"I don’t think your boss will be too pleased if you come back without it, will he?\" She did not move; she merely stared at him, the tip of her tongue moistening her thin mouth. \"So,\" said Harry, \"what kind of prophecy are we talking about, anyway?\" He could not think what to do but to keep talking. Neville’s arm was pressed against his, and he could feel him shaking; he could feel one of the others’ quickened breath on the back of his head. He was hoping they were all thinking hard about ways to get out of this, because his mind was blank. \"What kind of prophecy?\" repeated Bellatrix, the grin fading from her face. \"You jest, Harry Potter.\" \"Nope, not jesting,\" said Harry, his eyes flicking from Death Eater to Death Eater, looking for a weak link, a space through which they could escape. \"How come Voldemort wants it?\" Several of the Death Eaters let out low hisses. \"You dare speak his name?\" whispered Bellatrix. \"Yeah,\" said Harry, maintaining his tight grip on the glass ball, expecting another attempt to bewitch it from him. \"Yeah, I’ve got no problem with saying Vol--\" \"Shut your mouth!\" Bellatrix shrieked. \"You dare speak his name with your unworthy lips, you dare besmirch it with your half-blood’s tongue, you dare -\" \"Did you know he’s a half-blood too?\" said Harry recklessly. Hermione gave a little moan in his ear. \"Voldemort? Yeah, his mother was a witch but his dad was a Muggle - or has he been telling you lot he’s pure-blood?\" \"STUPEF--\" \"NO!\" A jet of red light had shot from the end of Bellatrix Lestrange’s wand, but Malfoy had deflected it; his spell caused hers to hit the shelf a foot to the left of Harry and several of the glass orbs there shattered. Two figures, pearly-white as ghosts, fluid as smoke, unfurled themselves from the fragments of broken glass upon the floor and each began to speak; their voices vied with each other, so that only fragments of what they were saying could be heard over Malfoy and Bellatrix’s shouts. \"... at the solstice will come a new...\" said the figure of an old, bearded man. \"DO NOT ATTACK! WE NEED THE PROPHECY!\" \"He dared - he dares -\" shrieked Bellatrix incoherently, \"he stands there - filthy half-blood -\" \"WAIT UNTIL WE’VE GOT THE PROPHECY!\" bawled Malfoy. \"... and none will come after...\" said the figure of a young woman. The two figures that had burst from the shattered spheres had melted into thin air. Nothing remained of them or their erstwhile homes but fragments of glass upon the floor. They had, however, given Harry an idea. The problem was going to be conveying it to the others. \"You haven’t told me what’s so special about this prophecy I’m supposed to be handing over,\" he said, playing for time. He moved his foot slowly sideways, feeling around for someone else’s. \"Do not play games with us, Potter,\" said Malfoy. \"I’m not playing games,\" said Harry, half his mind on the conversation, half on his wandering foot. And then he found someone’s toes and pressed down upon them. A sharp intake of breath behind him told him they were Hermiones. \"What?\" she whispered. \"Dumbledore never told you the reason you bear that scar was hidden in the bowels of the Department of Mysteries?\" Malfoy sneered. \"I - what?\" said Harry. And for a moment he quite forgot his plan. \"What about my scar?\" \"What?\" whispered Hermione more urgently behind him. \"Can this be?\" said Malfoy, sounding maliciously delighted; some of the Death Eaters were laughing again, and under cover of their laughter, Harry hissed to Hermione, moving his lips as little as possible, \"Smash shelves -\" \"Dumbledore never told you?\" Malfoy repeated. \"Well, this explains why you didn’t come earlier, Potter, the Dark Lord wondered why -\" \"- when I say now-\" \"- you didn’t come running when he showed you the place where it was hidden in your dreams. He thought natural curiosity would make you want to hear the exact wording...\" \"Did he?\" said Harry. Behind him he felt rather than heard Hermione passing his message to the others and he sought to keep talking, to distract the Death Eaters. \"So he wanted me to come and get it, did he? Why?\" \"Why?\" Malfoy sounded incredulously delighted. \"Because the only people who are permitted to retrieve a prophecy from the Department of Mysteries, Potter, are those about whom it was made, as the Dark Lord discovered when he attempted to use others to steal it for him.\" \"And why did he want to steal a prophecy about me?\" \"About both of you, Potter, about both of you... haven’t you ever wondered why the Dark Lord tried to kill you as a baby?\" Harry stared into the slitted eye-holes through which Malfoy’s grey eyes were gleaming. Was this prophecy the reason Harry’s parents had died, the reason he carried his lightning-bolt scar? Was the answer to all of this clutched in his hand? \"Someone made a prophecy about Voldemort and me?\" he said quietly, gazing at Lucius Malfoy, his fingers tightening over the warm glass sphere in his hand. It was hardly larger than a Snitch and still gritty with dust. \"And he’s made me come and get it for him? Why couldn’t he come and get it himself?\" \"Get it himself?\" shrieked Bellatrix, over a cackle of mad laughter. \"The Dark Lord, walk into the Ministry of Magic, when they are so sweetly ignoring his return? The Dark Lord, reveal himself to the Aurors, when at the moment they are wasting their time on my dear cousin?\" \"So, he’s got you doing his dirty work for him, has he?\" said Harry. \"Like he tried to get Sturgis to steal it - and Bode?\" \"Very good, Potter, very good...\" said Malfoy slowly. \"But the Dark Lord knows you are not unintell--\" \"NOW!\" yelled Harry. Five different voices behind him bellowed, \"REDUCTO!\" Five curses flew in five different directions and the shelves opposite them exploded as they hit; the towering structure swayed as a hundred glass spheres burst apart, pearly-white figures unfurled into the air and floated there, their voices echoing from who knew what long-dead past amid the torrent of crashing glass and splintered wood now raining down upon the floor - \"RUN!\" Harry yelled, as the shelves swayed precariously and more glass spheres began to fall from above. He seized a handful of Hermione’s robes and dragged her forwards, holding one arm over his head as chunks of shelf and shards of glass thundered down upon them. A Death Eater lunged forwards through the cloud of dust and Harry elbowed him hard in the masked face; they were all yelling, there were cries of pain, and thunderous crashes as the shelves collapsed upon themselves, weirdly echoing fragments of the Seers unleashed from their spheres - Harry found the way ahead clear and saw Ron, Ginny and Luna sprint past him, their arms over their heads; something heavy struck him on the side of the face but he merely ducked his head and sprinted onwards; a hand caught him by the shoulder; he heard Hermione shout, \"Stupefy!\" The hand released him at once - They were at the end of row ninety-seven; Harry turned right and began to sprint in earnest; he could hear footsteps right behind him and Hermione’s voice urging Neville on; straight ahead, the door through which they had come was ajar; Harry could see the glittering light of the bell jar; he pelted through the doorway, the prophecy still clutched tight and safe in his hand, and waited for the others to hurtle over the threshold before slamming the door behind them - \"Colloportus!\" gasped Hermione and the door sealed itself with an odd squelching noise. \"Where - where are the others?\" gasped Harry. He had thought Ron, Luna and Ginny were ahead of them, that they would be waiting in this room, but there was nobody there. \"They must have gone the wrong way!\" whispered Hermione, terror in her face. \"Listen!\" whispered Neville. Footsteps and shouts echoed from behind the door they had just sealed; Harry put his ear close to the door to listen and heard Lucius Malfoy roar, \"Leave Nott, leave him, I say -- his injuries will be nothing to the Dark Lord compared to losing that prophecy. Jugson, come back here, we need to organize! We’ll split into pairs and search, and don’t forget, be gentle with Potter until we’ve got the prophecy, you can kill the others if necessary - Bellatrix, Rodolphus, you take the left; Crabbe, Rabastan, go right -Jugson, Dolohov, the door straight ahead - Macnair and Avery, through here - Rookwood, over there - Mulciber, come with me!\" \"What do we do?\" Hermione asked Harry, trembling from head to foot. \"Well, we don’t stand here waiting for them to find us, for a start,\" said Harry. \"Let’s get away from this door.\" They ran as quietly as they could, past the shimmering bell jar where the tiny egg was hatching and unhatching, towards the exit into the circular hallway at the far end of the room. They were almost there when Harry heard something large and heavy collide with the door Hermione had charmed shut. \"Stand aside!\" said a rough voice. \"Alahomora!\" As the door flew open, Harry, Hermione and Neville dived under desks. They could see the bottom of the two Death Eaters’ robes drawing nearer, their feet moving rapidly. \"They might’ve run straight through to the hall,\" said the rough voice. \"Check under the desks,\" said another. Harry saw the knees of the Death Eaters bend; poking his wand out from under the desk, he shouted, \"STUPEFY!\" A jet of red light hit the nearest Death Eater; he fell backwards into a grandfather clock and knocked it over; the second Death Eater, however, had leapt aside to avoid Harry’s spell and was pointing his own wand at Hermione, who was crawling out from under the desk to get a better aim. \"Avada - Harry launched himself across the floor and grabbed the Death Eater around the knees, causing him to topple and his aim to go awry. Neville overturned a desk in his anxiety to help; and pointing his wand wildly at the struggling pair, he cried: \"EXPELLIARMUS!\" Both Harry’s and the Death Eater’s wands flew out of their hands and soared back towards the entrance to the Hall of Prophecy; both scrambled to their feet and charged after them, the Death Eater in front, Harry hot on his heels, and Neville bringing up the rear, plainly horrorstruck by what he had done. \"Get out of the way, Harry!\" yelled Neville, clearly determined to repair the damage. Harry flung himself sideways as Neville took aim again and shouted: \"STUPEFY!\" The jet of red light had flown right over the Death Eater’s shoulder and hit a glass-fronted cabinet on the wall full of variously shaped hour-glasses; the cabinet fell to the floor and burst apart, glass flying everywhere, sprang back up on to the wall, fully mended, then fell down again, and shattered - The Death Eater had snatched up his wand, which lay on the floor beside the glittering bell jar. Harry ducked down behind another desk as the man turned; his mask had slipped so that he couldn’t see. He ripped it off with his free hand and shouted: \"STUP--\" \"STUPEFY!\" screamed Hermione, who had just caught up with them. The jet of red light hit the Death Eater in the middle of his chest: he froze, his arm still raised, his wand fell to the floor with a clatter and he collapsed backwards towards the bell jar. Harry expected to hear a dunk, for the man to hit solid glass and slide off the jar on to the floor, but instead, his head sank through the surface of the bell jar as though it were nothing but a soap bubble and he came to rest, sprawled on his back on the table, with his head lying inside the jar full of glittering wind. \"Accio wand!\" cried Hermione. Harry’s wand flew from a dark corner into her hand and she threw it to him. \"Thanks,\" he said. \"Right, let’s get out of --\" \"Look out!\" said Neville, horrified. He was staring at the Death Eater’s head in the bell jar. All three of them raised their wands again, but none of them struck: they were all gazing, openmouthed, appalled, at what was happening to the man’s head. It was shrinking very fast, growing balder and balder, the black hair and stubble retracting into his skull; his cheeks becoming smooth, his skull round and covered with a peachlike fuzz... A baby’s head now sat grotesquely on top of the thick, muscled neck of the Death Eater as he struggled to get up again; but even as they watched, their mouths open, the head began to swell to its previous proportions again; thick black hair was sprouting from the pate and chin... \"It’s Time,\" said Hermione in an awestruck voice. \"Time...\" The Death Eater shook his ugly head again, trying to clear it, but before he could pull himself together it began to shrink back to babyhood once more... There was a shout from a room nearby, then a crash and a scream. \"RON?\" Harry yelled, turning quickly from the monstrous transformation taking place before them. \"GINNY? LUNA?\" \"Harry!\" Hermione screamed. The Death Eater had pulled his head out of the bell jar. His appearance was utterly bizarre, his tiny baby’s head bawling loudly while his thick arms flailed dangerously in all directions, narrowly missing Harry, who had ducked. Harry raised his wand but to his amazement Hermione seized his arm. \"You can’t hurt a baby!\" There was no time to argue the point; Harry could hear more footsteps growing louder from the Hall of Prophecy and knew, too late, that he ought not to have shouted and given away their position. \"Come on!\" he said, and leaving the ugly baby-headed Death Eater staggering behind them they took off for the door that stood open at the other end of the room, leading back into the black hallway. They had run halfway towards it when Harry saw through the open door two more Death Eaters running across the black room towards them; veering left, he burst instead into a small, dark, cluttered office and slammed the door behind them. \"Collo--\" began Hermione, but before she could complete the spell the door had burst open and the two Death Eaters had come hurtling inside. With a cry of triumph, both yelled: \"IMPEDIMENTA!\" Harry, Hermione and Neville were all knocked backwards off their feet; Neville was thrown over the desk and disappeared from view; Hermione smashed into a bookcase and was promptly deluged in a cascade of heavy books; the back of Harry’s head slammed into the stone wall behind him, tiny lights burst in front of his eyes and for a moment he was too dizzy and bewildered to react. \"WE’VE GOT HIM!\" yelled the Death Eater nearest Harry. \"IN AN OFFICE OFF--\" \"Silencio!\" cried Hermione and the man’s voice was extinguished. He continued to mouth through the hole in his mask, but no sound came out. He was thrust aside by his fellow Death Eater. \"Petrificus Totalus!\" shouted Harry, as the second Death Eater raised his wand. His arms and legs snapped together and he fell forwards, face down on to the rug at Harry’s feet, stiff as a board and unable to move. \"Well done, Ha--\" But the Death Eater Hermione had just struck dumb made a sudden slashing movement with his wand; a streak of what looked like purple flame passed right across Hermione’s chest. She gave a tiny \"Oh!\" as though of surprise and crumpled on to the floor, where she lay motionless. \"HERMIONE!\" Harry fell to his knees beside her as Neville crawled rapidly towards her from under the desk, his wand held up in front of him. The Death Eater kicked out hard at Neville’s head as he emerged - his foot broke Neville’s wand in two and connected with his face. Neville gave a howl of pain and recoiled, clutching his mouth and nose. Harry twisted around, his own wand held high, and saw that the Death Eater had ripped off his mask and was pointing his wand directly at Harry, who recognized the long, pale, twisted face from the Daily Prophet: Antonin Dolohov, the wizard who had murdered the Prewetts. Dolohov grinned. With his free hand, he pointed from the prophecy still clutched in Harrys hand, to himself, then at Hermione. Though he could no longer speak, his meaning could not have been clearer. Give me the prophecy, or you get the same as her... \"Like you won’t kill us all anyway, the moment I hand it over!\" said Harry. A whine of panic inside his head was preventing him thinking properly: he had one hand on Hermione’s shoulder, which was still warm, yet did not dare look at her properly. Don’t let her be dead, don’t let her be dead, it’s my fault if she’s dead... \"Whaddever you do, Harry,\" said Neville fiercely from under the desk, lowering his hands to show a clearly broken nose and blood pouring down his mouth and chin, \"don’d gib it to him!\" Then there was a crash outside the door and Dolohov looked over his shoulder - the baby-headed Death Eater had appeared in the doorway, his head bawling, his great fists still flailing uncontrollably at everything around him. Harry seized his chance: \"PETRIFICUS TOTALUS!\" The spell hit Dolohov before he could block it and he toppled forwards across his comrade, both of them rigid as boards and unable to move an inch. \"Hermione,\" Harry said at once, shaking her as the baby-headed Death Eater blundered out of sight again. \"Hermione, wake up...\" \"Whad did he do to her?\" said Neville, crawling out from under the desk to kneel at her other side, blood streaming from his rapidly swelling nose. \"I dunno...\" Neville groped for Hermione’s wrist. \"Dat’s a pulse, Harry, I’b sure id is.\" Such a powerful wave of relief swept through Harry that for a moment he felt light-headed. \"She’s alive?\" \"Yeah, I dink so.\" There was a pause in which Harry listened hard for the sound of more footsteps, but all he could hear were the whimpers and blunderings of the baby-headed Death Eater in the next room. \"Neville, we’re not far from the exit,\" Harry whispered, \"we’re right next to that circular room... if we can just get you across it and find the right door before any more Death Eaters come, I’ll bet you can get Hermione up the corridor and into the lift... then you could find someone... raise the alarm...\" \"And whad are you going do do?\" said Neville, mopping his bleeding nose with his sleeve and frowning at Harry. \"I’ve got to find the others,\" said Harry. \"Well, I’b going do find dem wid you,\" said Neville firmly. \"But Hermione --\" \"We’ll dake her wid us,\" said Neville firmly. \"I’ll carry her -- you’re bedder at fighding dem dan I ab -\" He stood up and seized one of Hermione’s arms, glaring at Harry, who hesitated, then grabbed the other and helped hoist Hermione’s limp form over Neville’s shoulders. \"Wait,\" said Harry, snatching up Hermione’s wand from the floor and shoving it into Neville’s hand, \"you’d better take this.\" Neville kicked aside the broken fragments of his own wand as they walked slowly towards the door. \"My gran’s going do kill be,\" said Neville thickly, blood spattering from his nose as he spoke, \"dat was by dad’s old wand.\" Harry stuck his head out of the door and looked around cautiously. The baby-headed Death Eater was screaming and banging into things, toppling grandfather clocks and overturning desks, bawling and confused, while the glass-fronted cabinet that Harry now suspected had contained Time-Turners continued to fall, shatter and repair itself on the wall behind them. \"He’s never going to notice us,\" he whispered. \"C’mon... keep close behind me...\" They crept out of the office and back towards the door into the black hallway, which now seemed completely deserted. They walked a few steps forwards, Neville tottering slightly due to Hermione’s weight; the door of the Time Room swung shut behind them and the walls began to rotate once more. The recent blow on the back of Harrys head seemed to have unsteadied him; he narrowed his eyes, swaying slightly, until the walls stopped moving again. With a sinking heart, Harry saw that Hermione’s fiery crosses had faded from the doors. \"So which way d’you reck--?\" But before they could make a decision as to which way to try, a door to their right sprang open and three people fell out of it. \"Ron!\" croaked Harry, dashing towards them. \"Ginny - are you all -?\" \"Harry,\" said Ron, giggling weakly, lurching forwards, seizing the front of Harry’s robes and gazing at him with unfocused eyes, \"there you are... ha ha ha... you look funny, Harry... you’re all messed up...\" Ron’s face was very white and something dark was trickling from the corner of his mouth. Next moment his knees had given way, but he still clutched the front of Harry’s robes, so that Harry was pulled into a kind of bow. \"Ginny?\" Harry said fearfully. \"What happened?\" But Ginny shook her head and slid down the wall into a sitting position, panting and holding her ankle. \"I think her ankle’s broken, I heard something crack,\" whispered Luna, who was bending over her and who alone seemed to be unhurt. \"Four of them chased us into a dark room full of planets; it was a very odd place, some of the time we were just floating in the dark -\" \"Harry, we saw Uranus up close!\" said Ron, still giggling feebly. \"Get it, Harry? We saw Uranus - ha ha ha -\" A bubble of blood grew at the corner of Ron’s mouth and burst. \"- anyway, one of them grabbed Ginny’s foot, I used the Reductor Curse and blew up Pluto in his face, but...\" Luna gestured hopelessly at Ginny, who was breathing in a very shallow way, her eyes still closed. \"And what about Ron?\" said Harry fearfully, as Ron continued to giggle, still hanging off the front of Harry’s robes. \"I don’t know what they hit him with,\" said Luna sadly, \"but he’s gone a bit funny, I could hardly get him along at all.\" \"Harry,\" said Ron, pulling Harry’s ear down to his mouth and still giggling weakly, \"you know who this girl is, Harry? She’s Loony... Loony Lovegood... ha ha ha \" \"We’ve got to get out of here,\" said Harry firmly. \"Luna, can you help Ginny?\" \"Yes,\" said Luna, sticking her wand behind her ear for safekeeping, then putting an arm around Ginnys waist and pulling her up. \"It’s only my ankle, I can do it myself!\" said Ginny impatiently, but next moment she had collapsed sideways and grabbed Luna for support. Harry pulled Ron’s arm over his shoulder just as, so many months ago, he had pulled Dudley’s. He looked around: they had a one in twelve chance of getting the exit right first time - He heaved Ron towards a door; they were within a few feet of it when another door across the hall burst open and three Death Eaters sped in, led by Bellatrix Lestrange. \"There they are!\" she shrieked. Stunning Spells shot across the room: Harry smashed his way through the door ahead, flung Ron unceremoniously from him and ducked back to help Neville in with Hermione: they were all over the threshold just in time to slam the door against Bellatrix. \"Colloportus!\" shouted Harry, and he heard three bodies slam into the door on the other side. \"It doesn’t matter!\" said a man’s voice. \"There are other ways in - WE’VE GOT THEM, THEY’RE HERE!\" Harry span around; they were back in the Brain Room and, sure enough, there were doors all around the walls. He could hear footsteps in the hall behind them as more Death Eaters came running to join the first. \"Luna - Neville - help me!\" The three of them tore around the room, sealing the doors as they went; Harry crashed into a table and rolled over the top of it in his haste to reach the next door: \"Colloportus!\" There were footsteps running along behind the doors, every now and then another heavy body would launch itself against one, so it creaked and shuddered; Luna and Neville were bewitching the doors along the opposite wall - then, as Harry reached the very top of the room, he heard Luna cry: \"Collo--aaaaaaaaargh...\" He turned in time to see her flying through the air; five Death Eaters were surging into the room through the door she had not reached in time; Luna hit a desk, slid over its surface and on to the floor on the other side where she lay sprawled, as still as Hermione. \"Get Potter!\" shrieked Bellatrix, and she ran at him; he dodged her and sprinted back up the room; he was safe as long as they thought they might hit the prophecy - \"Hey!\" said Ron, who had staggered to his feet and was now tottering drunkenly towards Harry, giggling. \"Hey Harry, there are brains in here, ha h a ha, isn’t that weird, Harry?\" \"Ron, get out of the way, get down -\" But Ron had already pointed his wand at the tank. \"Honest, Harry, they’re brains - look -Accio brain!\" The scene seemed momentarily frozen. Harry, Ginny and Neville and each of the Death Eaters turned in spite of themselves to watch the top of the tank as a brain burst from the green liquid like a leaping fish: for a moment it seemed suspended in midair, then it soared towards Ron, spinning as it came, and what looked like ribbons of moving images flew from it, unraveling like rolls of film- \"Ha ha ha, Harry, look at it -\" said Ron, watching it disgorge its gaudy innards, \"Harry come and touch it; bet it’s weird -\" \"RON, NO!\" Harry did not know what would happen if Ron touched the tentacles of thought now flying behind the brain, but he was sure it would not be anything good. He darted forwards but Ron had already caught the brain in his outstretched hands. The moment they made contact with his skin, the tentacles began wrapping themselves around Ron’s arms like ropes. \"Harry, look what’s happen-- No - no - I don’t like it - no, stop - stop -\" But the thin ribbons were spinning around Ron’s chest now; he tugged and tore at them as the brain was pulled tight against him like an octopus’s body. \"Diffindo!\" yelled Harry, trying to sever the feelers wrapping themselves tightly around Ron before his eyes, but they would not break. Ron fell over, still thrashing against his bonds. \"Harry, it’ll suffocate him!\" screamed Ginny, immobilized by her broken ankle on the floor - then a jet of red light flew from one of the Death Eater’s wands and hit her squarely in the face. She keeled over sideways and lay there unconscious. \"STUBEFY!\" shouted Neville, wheeling around and waving Hermione’s wand at the oncoming Death Eaters, \"STUBEFY, STUBEFY!\" But nothing happened. One of the Death Eaters shot their own Stunning Spell at Neville; it missed him by inches. Harry and Neville were now the only two left fighting the five Death Eaters, two of whom sent off streams of silver light like arrows which missed but left craters in the wall behind them. Harry ran for it as Bellatrix Lestrange raced right at him: holding the prophecy high above his head, he sprinted back up the room; all he could think of doing was to draw the Death Eaters away from the others. It seemed to have worked; they streaked after him, knocking chairs and tables flying but not daring to bewitch him in case they hurt the prophecy, and he dashed through the only door still open, the one through which the Death Eaters themselves had come; inwardly praying that Neville would stay with Ron and find some way of releasing him. He ran a few feet into the new room and felt the floor vanish - He was falling down steep stone step after steep stone step, bouncing on every tier until at last, with a crash that knocked all the breath out of his body, he landed flat on his back in the sunken pit where the stone archway stood on its dais. The whole room was ringing with the Death Eaters’ laughter: he looked up and saw the five who had been in the Brain Room descending towards him, while as many more emerged through other doorways and began leaping from bench to bench towards him. Harry got to his feet though his legs were trembling so badly they barely supported him: the prophecy was still miraculously unbroken in his left hand, his wand clutched tightly in his right. He backed away, looking around, trying to keep all the Death Eaters within his sight. The back of his legs hit something solid: he had reached the dais where the archway stood. He climbed backwards onto it. The Death Eaters all halted, gazing at him. Some were panting as hard as he was. One was bleeding badly; Dolohov, freed of the Body-Bind Curse, was leering, his wand pointing straight at Harrys face. \"Potter, your race is run,\" drawled Lucius Malfoy, pulling off his mask, \"now hand me the prophecy like a good boy.\" \"Let - let the others go, and I’ll give it to you!\" said Harry desperately. A few of the Death Eaters laughed. \"You are not in a position to bargain, Potter,\" said Lucius Malfoy, his pale face flushed with pleasure. \"You see, there are ten of us and only one of you... or hasn’t Dumbledore ever taught you how to count?\" \"He’s dot alone!\" shouted a voice from above them. \"He’s still god be!\" Harry’s heart sank: Neville was scrambling down the stone benches towards them, Hermiones wand held fast in his trembling hand. \"Neville - no - go back to Ron -\" \"STUBEFY!\" Neville shouted again, pointing his wand at each Death Eater in turn. \"STUBEFY! STUBE--\" One of the largest Death Eaters seized Neville from behind, pinioning his arms to his sides. He struggled and kicked; several of the Death Eaters laughed. \"It’s Longbottom, isn’t it\" sneered Lucius Malfoy. \"Well, your grandmother is used to losing family members to our cause... your death will not come as a great shock.\" \"Longbottom?\" repeated Bellatrix, and a truly evil smile lit her gaunt face. \"Why, I have had the pleasure of meeting your parents, boy,\" \"I DOE YOU HAB!\" roared Neville, and he fought so hard against his captors encircling grip that the Death Eater shouted, \"Someone Stun him!\" \"No, no, no,\" said Bellatrix. She looked transported, alive with excitement as she glanced at Harry, then back at Neville. \"No, let’s see how long Longbottom lasts before he cracks like his parents... unless Potter wants to give us the prophecy.\" \"DON’D GIB ID DO DEM!\" roared Neville, who seemed beside himself, kicking and writhing as Bellatrix drew nearer to him and his captor, her wand raised. \"DON’D GIB ID DO DEM, HARRY!\" Bellatrix raised her wand. \"Crucio!\" Neville screamed, his legs drawn up to his chest so that the Death Eater holding him was momentarily holding him off the ground. The Death Eater dropped him and he fell to the floor, twitching and screaming in agony. \"That was just a taster!\" said Bellatrix, raising her wand so that Neville’s screams stopped and he lay sobbing at her feet. She turned and gazed up at Harry. \"Now, Potter, either give us the prophecy, or watch your little friend die the hard way!\" Harry did not have to think; there was no choice. The prophecy was hot with the heat of his clutching hand as he held it out. Malfoy jumped forwards to take it. Then, high above them, two more doors burst open and five more people sprinted into the room: Sirius, Lupin, Moody, Tonks and Kingsley. Malfoy turned, and raised his wand, but Tonks had already sent a Stunning Spell right at him. Harry did not wait to see whether it had made contact, but dived off the dais out of the way. The Death Eaters were completely distracted by the appearance of the members of the Order, who were now raining spells down upon them as they jumped from step to step towards the sunken floor. Through the darting bodies, the flashes of light, Harry could see Neville crawling along. He dodged another jet of red light and flung himself flat on the ground to reach Neville. \"Are you okay?\" he yelled, as another spell soared inches over their heads. \"Yes,\" said Neville, trying to pull himself up. \"And Ron?\" \"I dink he’s all righd - he was still fighding de brain when I lefd -\" The stone floor between them exploded as a spell hit it, leaving a crater right where Neville’s hand had been only seconds before; both scrambled away from the spot, then a thick arm came out of nowhere, seized Harry around the neck and pulled him upright, so that his toes were barely touching the floor. \"Give it to me,\" growled a voice in his ear, \"give me the prophecy -\" The man was pressing so tightly on Harry’s windpipe that he could not breathe. Through watering eyes he saw Sirius dueling with a Death Eater some ten feet away; Kingsley was fighting two at once; Tonks, still halfway up the tiered seats, was firing spells down at Bellatrix - nobody seemed to realize that Harry was dying. He turned his wand backwards towards the man’s side, but had no breath to utter an incantation, and the man’s free hand was groping towards the hand in which Harry was grasping the prophecy - \"AARGH!\" Neville had come lunging out of nowhere; unable to articulate a spell, he had jabbed Hermione’s wand hard into the eyehole of the Death Eaters mask. The man relinquished Harry at once with a howl of pain. Harry whirled around to face him and gasped: \"STUPEFY!\" The Death Eater keeled over backwards and his mask slipped off: it was Macnair, Buckbeak’s would-be killer, one of his eyes now swollen and bloodshot. \"Thanks!\" Harry said to Neville, pulling him aside as Sirius and his Death Eater lurched past, dueling so fiercely that their wands were blurs; then Harry’s foot made contact with something round and hard and he slipped. For a moment he thought he had dropped the prophecy, but then he saw Moody’s magical eye spinning away across the floor. Its owner was lying on his side, bleeding from the head, and his attacker was now bearing down upon Harry and Neville: Dolohov, his long pale face twisted with glee. \"Tarantallegra!\" he shouted, his wand pointing at Neville, whose legs went immediately into a kind of frenzied tap-dance, unbalancing him and causing him to fall to the floor again. \"Now, Potter -\" He made the same slashing movement with his wand that he had used on Hermione just as Harry yelled, \"Protego!\" Harry felt something streak across his face like a blunt knife; the force of it knocked him sideways and he fell over Neville’s jerking legs, but the Shield Charm had stopped the worst of the spell. Dolohov raised his wand again. \"Accio proph--\" Sirius had hurtled out of nowhere, rammed Dolohov with his shoulder and sent him flying out of the way. The prophecy had again flown to the tips of Harry’s fingers but he had managed to cling on to it. Now Sirius and Dolohov were dueling, their wands flashing like swords, sparks flying from their wand-tips - Dolohov drew back his wand to make the same slashing movement he had used on Harry and Hermione. Springing up, Harry yelled, \"Petrificus Totalus!\" Once again, Dolohov’s arms and legs snapped together and he keeled over backwards, landing with a crash on his back. \"Nice one!\" shouted Sirius, forcing Harry’s head down as a pair of Stunning Spells flew towards them. \"Now I want you to get out of-\" They both ducked again; a jet of green light had narrowly missed Sirius. Across the room Harry saw Tonks fall from halfway up the stone steps, her limp form toppling from stone seat to stone seat and Bellatrix, triumphant, running back towards the fray. \"Harry, take the prophecy, grab Neville and run!\" Sirius yelled, dashing to meet Bellatrix. Harry did not see what happened next: Kingsley swayed across his field of vision, battling with the pockmarked and no longer masked Rookwood; another jet of green light flew over Harry’s head as he launched himself towards Neville - \"Can you stand?\" he bellowed in Neville’s ear, as Neville’s legs jerked and twitched uncontrollably. \"Put your arm round my neck -\" Neville did so - Harry heaved -- Neville’s legs were still flying in every direction, they would not support him, and then, out of nowhere, a man lunged at them: both fell backwards, Neville’s legs waving wildly like an overturned beetle’s, Harry with his left arm held up in the air to try to save the small glass ball from being smashed. \"The prophecy, give me the prophecy, Potter!\" snarled Lucius Malfoy’s voice in his ear, and Harry felt the tip of Malfoy’s wand pressing hard between his ribs. \"No - get - off - me... Neville - catch it!\" Harry flung the prophecy across the floor, Neville spun himself around on his back and scooped the ball to his chest. Malfoy pointed the wand instead at Neville, but Harry jabbed his own wand back over his shoulder and yelled, \"Impedimenta!\" Malfoy was blasted off his back. As Harry scrambled up again he looked around and saw Malfoy smash into the dais on which Sirius and Bellatrix were now dueling. Malfoy aimed his wand at Harry and Neville again, but before he could draw breath to strike, Lupin had jumped between them. \"Harry, round up the others and GO!\" Harry seized Neville by the shoulder of his robes and lifted him bodily on to the first tier of stone steps; Neville’s legs twitched and jerked and would not support his weight; Harry heaved again with all the strength he possessed and they climbed another step - A spell hit the stone bench at Harrys heel; it crumbled away and he fell back to the step below. Neville sank to the ground, his legs still jerking and thrashing, and he thrust the prophecy into his pocket. \"Come on!\" said Harry desperately, hauling at Neville’s robes. \"Just try and push with your legs\" He gave another stupendous heave and Neville’s robes tore all along the left seam - the small spun-glass ball dropped from his pocket and, before either of them could catch it, one of Neville’s floundering feet kicked it: it flew some ten feet to their right and smashed on the step beneath them. As both of them stared at the place where it had broken, appalled at what had happened, a pearly-white figure with hugely magnified eyes rose into the air, unnoticed by any but them. Harry could see its mouth moving, but in all the crashes and screams and yells surrounding them, not one word of the prophecy could he hear. The figure stopped speaking and dissolved into nothingness. \"Harry, I’b sorry!\" cried Neville, his face anguished as his legs continued to flounder. \"I’b so sorry, Harry, I didn’d bean do -\" \"It doesn’t matter!\" Harry shouted. \"Just try and stand, let’s get out of -\" \"Dubbledore!\" said Neville, his sweaty face suddenly transported, staring over Harry’s shoulder. \"What?\" \"DUBBLEDORE!\" Harry turned to look where Neville was staring. Directly above them, framed in the doorway from the Brain Room, stood Albus Dumbledore, his wand aloft, his face white and furious. Harry felt a kind of electric charge surge through every particle of his body - they were saved. Dumbledore sped down the steps past Neville and Harry, who had no more thoughts of leaving. Dumbledore was already at the foot of the steps when the Death Eaters nearest realized he was there and yelled to the others. One of the Death Eaters ran for it, scrabbling like a monkey up the stone steps opposite. Dumbledore’s spell pulled him back as easily and effortlessly as though he had hooked him with an invisible line - Only one pair was still battling, apparently unaware of the new arrival. Harry saw Sirius duck Bellatrix’s jet of red light: he was laughing at her. \"Come on, you can do better than that!\" he yelled, his voice echoing around the cavernous room. The second jet of light hit him squarely on the chest. The laughter had not quite died from his face, but his eyes widened in shock. Harry released Neville, though he was unaware of doing so. He was jumping down the steps again, pulling out his wand, as Dumbledore, too, turned towards the dais. It seemed to take Sirius an age to fall: his body curved in a graceful arc as he sank backwards through the ragged veil hanging from the arch. Harry saw the look of mingled fear and surprise on his godfather’s wasted, once-handsome face as he fell through the ancient doorway and disappeared behind the veil, which fluttered for a moment as though in a high wind, then fell back into place. Harry heard Bellatrix Lestrange’s triumphant scream, but knew it meant nothing - Sirius had only just fallen through the archway, he would reappear from the other side any second... But Sirius did not reappear. \"SIRIUS!\" Harry yelled. \"SIRIUS!\" He had reached the floor, his breath coming in searing gasps. Sirius must be just behind the curtain, he, Harry, would pull him back out... But as he reached the ground and sprinted towards the dais, Lupin grabbed Harry around the chest, holding him back. \"There’s nothing you can do, Harry -\" \"Get him, save him, he’s only just gone through!\" \"- it’s too late, Harry.\" \"We can still reach him -\" Harry struggled hard and viciously, but Lupin would not let go... \"There’s nothing you can do, Harry... nothing... he’s gone.\" \n",

            " THIRTYTHREE  THE DEATH EATERS Voldemort looked away from Harry and began examining his own body. His hands were like large, pale spiders; his long white fingers caressed his own chest, his arms, his face; the red eyes, whose pupils were slits, like a cats, gleamed still more brightly through the darkness. He held up his hands and flexed the fingers, his expression rapt and exultant. He took not the slightest notice of Wormtail, who lay twitching and bleeding on the ground, nor of the great snake, which had slithered back into sight and was circling Harry again, hissing. Voldemort slipped one of those unnaturally longfingered hands into a deep pocket and drew out a wand. He caressed it gently too; and then he raised it, and pointed it at Wormtail, who was lifted off the ground and thrown against the headstone where Harry was tied; he fell to the foot of it and lay there, crumpled up and crying. Voldemort turned his scarlet eyes upon Harry, laughing a high, cold, mirthless laugh. Wormtail's robes were shining with blood now; he had wrapped the stump of his arm in them. \"My Lord . . .\" he choked, \"my Lord . . . you promised . . . you did promise ...\" \"Hold out your arm,\" said Voldemort lazily. \"Oh Master . . . thank you, Master ...\" He extended the bleeding stump, but Voldemort laughed again. \"The other arm, Wormtail.\" \"Master, please . . .please ...\" Voldemort bent down and pulled out Wormtail's left arm; he forced the sleeve of Wormtail's robes up past his elbow, and Harry saw something upon the skin there, something like a vivid red tattoo  a skull with a snake protruding from its mouth  the image that had appeared in the sky at the Quidditch World Cup: the Dark Mark. Voldemort examined it carefully, ignoring Wormtail's uncontrollable weeping. \"It is back,\" he said softly, \"they will all have noticed it... and now, we shall see ... now we shall know ...\" He pressed his long white forefinger to the brand on Wormtail's arm. The scar on Harry s forehead seared with a sharp pain again, and Wormtail let out a fresh howl; Voldemort removed his fingers from Wormtail's mark, and Harry saw that it had turned jet black. A look of cruel satisfaction on his face, Voldemort straightened up, threw back his head, and stared around at the dark graveyard. \"How many will be brave enough to return when they feel it?\" he whispered, his gleaming red eyes fixed upon the stars. \"And how many will be foolish enough to stay away?\" He began to pace up and down before Harry and Wormtail, eyes sweeping the graveyard all the while. After a minute or so, he looked down at Harry again, a cruel smile twisting his snakelike face. \"You stand, Harry Potter, upon the remains of my late father,\" he hissed softly. \"A Muggle and a fool. . . very like your dear mother. But they both had their uses, did they not? Your mother died to defend you as a child . . . and I killed my father, and see how useful he has proved himself, in death. ...\" Voldemort laughed again. Up and down he paced, looking all around him as he walked, and the snake continued to circle in the grass. \"You see that house upon the hillside, Potter? My father lived there. My mother, a witch who lived here in this village, fell in love with him. But he abandoned her when she told him what she was. ... He didn't like magic, my father . . . \"He left her and returned to his Muggle parents before I was even born. Potter, and she died giving birth to me, leaving me to be raised in a Muggle orphanage . . . but I vowed to find him ... I revenged myself upon him, that fool who gave me his name . . . Tom Riddle. . . .\" Still he paced, his red eyes darting from grave to grave. \"Listen to me, reliving family history . . .\" he said quietly, \"why, I am growing quite sentimental. . . . But look, Harry! My true family returns. . . .\" The air was suddenly full of the swishing of cloaks. Between graves, behind the yew tree, in every shadowy space, wizards were Apparating. All of them were hooded and masked. And one by one they moved forward . . . slowly, cautiously, as though they could hardly believe their eyes Voldemort stood in silence, waiting for them. Then one of the Death Eaters fell to his knees, crawled toward Voldemort and kissed the hem of his black robes. Master . . . Master \" he murmured. The Death Eaters behind him did the same; each of them approaching Voldemort on his knees and kissing his robes, before backing away and standing up, forming a silent circle, which enclosed Tom Riddle s grave, Harry, Voldemort, and the sobbing and twitching heap that was Wormtail. Yet they left gaps in the circle, as though waiting for more people. Voldemort, however, did not seem to expect more. He looked around at the hooded faces, and though there was no wind rustling seemed to run around the circle, as though it had shivered. \"Welcome, Death Eaters,\" said Voldemort quietly. \"Thirteen years. . . thirteen years since last we met. Yet you answer my call as though it were yesterday, we are still united under the Dark Mark, then! Or are we?\" He put back his terrible face and sniffed, his slitlike nostrils widening. \"I smell guilt,\" he said. \"There is a stench or guilt upon the air. A second shiver ran around the circle, as though each member of it longed, but did not dare to step back from him. \"I see you all, whole and healthy, with your powers intact  such prompt appearances! and I ask myself . . . why did this band of wizards never come to the aid of their master, to whom they swore eternal loyalty?\" No one spoke. No one moved except Wormtail, who was upon the ground, still sobbing over his bleeding arm. \"And I answer myself,\" whispered Voldemort, \"they must have believed me broken, they thought I was gone. They slipped back among my enemies, and they pleaded innocence, and ignorance, and bewitchment. . . . \"And then I ask myself, but how could they have believed I would not rise again! They, who knew the steps I took, long ago, to guard myself against mortal death! They, who had seen proofs of the immensity of my power in the times when I was mightier than any wizard living! \"And I answer myself, perhaps they believed a still greater power could exist, one that could vanquish even Lord Voldemort. . . perhaps they now pay allegiance to another . . . perhaps that champion of commoners, of Mudbloods and Muggles, Albus Dumbledore?\" At the mention of Dumbledore's name, the members of the circle stirred, and some muttered and shook their heads. Voldemort ignored them. \"It is a disappointment to me ... I confess myself disappointed. . . .\" One of the men suddenly flung himself forward, breaking the circle. Trembling from head to foot, he collapsed at Voldemort's feet. \"Master!\" he shrieked, \"Master, forgive me! Forgive us all!\" Voldemort began to laugh. He raised his wand. \"Crucio!\" The Death Eater on the ground writhed and shrieked; Harry was sure the sound must carry to the houses around. . . . Let the police come, he thought desperately . . . anyone . .. anything. . . Voldemort raised his wand. The tortured Death Eater lay flat upon the ground, gasping. \"Get up, Avery,\" said Voldemort softly. \"Stand up. You ask for forgiveness? I do not forgive. I do not forget. Thirteen long years ... I want thirteen years' repayment before I forgive you. Wormtail here has paid some of his debt already, have you not, Wormtail?\" He looked down at Wormtail, who continued to sob. \"You returned to me, not out of loyalty, but out of fear of your old friends. You deserve this pain, Wormtail. You know that, don't you?\" \"Yes, Master,\" moaned Wormtail, \"please. Master . . . please ...\" \"Yet you helped return me to my body,\" said Voldemort coolly, watching Wormtail sob on the ground. \"Worthless and traitorous as you are, you helped me ... and Lord Voldemort rewards his helpers... .\" Voldemort raised his wand again and whirled it through the air. A streak of what looked like molten silver hung shining in the wand's wake. Momentarily shapeless, it writhed and then formed itself into a gleaming replica of a human hand, bright as moonlight, which soared downward and fixed itself upon Wormtails bleeding wrist. Wormtail's sobbing stopped abruptly. His breathing harsh and ragged, he raised his head and stared in disbelief at the silver hand, now attached seamlessly to his arm, as though he were wearing a dazzling glove. He flexed the shining fingers, then, trembling, picked up a small twig on the ground and crushed it into powder. \"My Lord,\" he whispered. \"Master ... it is beautiful. . . thank you... thank you. ...\" He scrambled forward on his knees and kissed the hem of Voldemort's robes. \"May your loyalty never waver again, Wormtail,\" said Voldemort. \"No, my Lord . . . never, my Lord . . .\" Wormtail stood up and took his place in the circle, staring at his powerful new hand, his face still shining with tears. Voldemort now approached the man on Wormtail's right. \"Lucius, my slippery friend,\" he whispered, halting before him. \"I am told that you have not renounced the old ways, though to the world you present a respectable face. You are still ready to take the lead in a spot of Muggletorture, I believe? Yet you never tried to find me, Lucius. . . . Your exploits at the Quidditch World Cup were fun, I daresay. . . but might not your energies have been better directed toward finding and aiding your master?\" \"My Lord, I was constantly on the alert,\" came Lucius Malfoy's voice swiftly from beneath the hood. \"Had there been any sign from you, any whisper of your whereabouts, I would have been at your side immediately, nothing could have prevented me \" \"And yet you ran from my Mark, when a faithful Death Eater sent it into the sky last summer?\" said Voldemort lazily, and Mr. Malfoy stopped talking abruptly. \"Yes, I know all about that, Lucius. . . . You have disappointed me. ... I expect more faithful service in the future.\" \"Of course, my Lord, of course. . . . You are merciful, thank you. ...\" Voldemort moved on, and stopped, staring at the space  large enough for two people  that separated Malfoy and the next man. \"The Lestranges should stand here,\" said Voldemort quietly. \"But they are entombed in Azkaban. They were faithful. They went to Azkaban rather than renounce me. . . . When Azkaban is broken open, the Lestranges will be honored beyond their dreams. The dementors will join us ... they are our natural allies ... we will recall the banished giants ... I shall have all my devoted servants returned to me, and an army of creatures whom all fear. ...\" He walked on. Some of the Death Eaters he passed in silence, but he paused before others and spoke to them. \"Macnair . . . destroying dangerous beasts for the Ministry of Magic now, Wormtail tells me? You shall have better victims than that soon, Macnair. Lord Voldemort will provide. ...\" \"Thank you, Master . . . thank you,\" murmured Macnair. \"And here\"  Voldemort moved on to the two largest hooded figures  \"we have Crabbe . . . you will do better this time, will you not, Crabbe? And you, Goyle?\" They bowed clumsily, muttering dully. \"Yes, Master ...\" \"We will, Master....\" \"The same goes for you, Nott,\" said Voldemort quietly as he walked past a stooped figure in Mr. Goyles shadow. \"My Lord, I prostrate myself before you, I am your most faithful \" \"That will do,\" said Voldemort. He had reached the largest gap of all, and he stood surveying it with his blank, red eyes, as though he could see people standing there. \"And here we have six missing Death Eaters . . . three dead in my service. One, too cowardly to return ... he will pay. One, who I believe has left me forever ... he will be killed, of course . . . and one, who remains my most faithful servant, and who has already reentered my service.\" The Death Eaters stirred, and Harry saw their eyes dart sideways at one another through their masks. \"He is at Hogwarts, that faithful servant, and it was through his efforts that our young friend arrived here tonight. . . . \"Yes,\" said Voldemort, a grin curling his lipless mouth as the eyes of the circle flashed in Harry's direction. \"Harry Potter has kindly joined us for my rebirthing party. One might go so far as to call him my guest of honor.\" There was a silence. Then the Death Eater to the right of Wormtail stepped forward, and Lucius Malfoy's voice spoke from under the mask. \"Master, we crave to know ... we beg you to tell us ... how you have achieved this . . . this miracle . . . how you managed to return to us. .. .\" \"Ah, what a story it is, Lucius,\" said Voldemort. \"And it begins  and ends  with my young friend here.\" He walked lazily over to stand next to Harry, so that the eyes of the whole circle were upon the two of them. The snake continued to circle. \"You know, of course, that they have called this boy my downfall?\" Voldemort said softly, his red eyes upon Harry, whose scar began to burn so fiercely that he almost screamed in agony. \"You all know that on the night I lost my powers and my body, I tried to kill him. His mother died in the attempt to save him  and unwittingly provided him with a protection I admit I had not foreseen. ... I could not touch the boy.\" Voldemort raised one of his long white fingers and put it very close to Harry's cheek. \"His mother left upon him the traces other sacrifice. . . . This is old magic, I should have remembered it, I was foolish to overlook it... but no matter. I can touch him now.\" Harry felt the cold tip of the long white finger touch him, and thought his head would burst with the pain. Voldemort laughed softly in his ear, then took the finger away and continued addressing the Death Eaters. \"I miscalculated, my friends, I admit it. My curse was deflected by the woman's foolish sacrifice, and it rebounded upon myself. Aaah . . . pain beyond pain, my friends; nothing could have prepared me for it. I was ripped from my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost. . . but still, I was alive. What I was, even I do not know... I, who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality. You know my goal  to conquer death. And now, I was tested, and it appeared that one or more of my experiments had worked ... for I had not been killed, though the curse should have done it. Nevertheless, I was as powerless as the weakest creature alive, and without the means to help myself... for I had no body, and every spell that might have helped me required the use of a wand. . . . \"I remember only forcing myself, sleeplessly, endlessly, second by second, to exist. ... I settled in a faraway place, in a forest, and I waited. . . . Surely, one of my faithful Death Eaters would try and find me. . . one of them would come and perform the magic I could not, to restore me to a body . . , but I waited in vain. ...\" The shiver ran once more around the circle of listening Death Eaters. Voldemort let the silence spiral horribly before continuing. \"Only one power remained to me. I could possess the bodies of others. But I dared not go where other humans were plentiful, for I knew that the Aurors were still abroad and searching for me. I sometimes inhabited animals  snakes, of course, being my preference  but I was little better off inside them than as pure spirit, for their bodies were ill adapted to perform magic . . . and my possession of them shortened their lives; none of them lasted long. . . . \"Then . . . four years ago . . . the means for my return seemed assured. A wizard  young, foolish, and gullible  wandered across my path in the forest I had made my home. Oh, he seemed the very chance I had been dreaming of... for he was a teacher at Dumbledore's school... he was easy to bend to my will... he brought me back to this country, and after a while, I took possession of his body, to supervise him closely as he carried out my orders. But my plan failed. I did not manage to steal the Sorcerer's Stone. I was not to be assured immortal life. I was thwarted . . . thwarted, once again, by Harry Potter. ...\" Silence once more; nothing was stirring, not even the leaves on the yew tree. The Death Eaters were quite motionless, the glittering eyes in their masks fixed upon Voldemort, and upon Harry. \"The servant died when I left his body, and I was left as weak as ever I had been,\" Voldemort continued. \"I returned to my hiding place far away, and I will not pretend to you that I didn't then fear that I might never regain my powers. . . . Yes, that was perhaps my darkest hour... I could not hope that I would be sent another wizard to possess . . . and I had given up hope, now, that any of my Death Eaters cared what had become of me. ...\" One or two of the masked wizards in the circle moved uncomfortably, but Voldemort took no notice. \"And then, not even a year ago, when I had almost abandoned hope, it happened at last... a servant returned to me. Wormtail here, who had faked his own death to escape justice, was driven out of hiding by those he had once counted friends, and decided to return to his master. He sought me in the country where it had long been rumored I was hiding . . . helped, of course, by the rats he met along the way. Wormtail has a curious affinity with rats, do you not, Wormtail? His filthy little friends told him there was a place, deep in an Albanian forest, that they avoided, where small animals like themselves had met their deaths by a dark shadow that possessed them. . . . \"But his journey back to me was not smooth, was it, Wormtail? For, hungry one night, on the edge of the very forest where he had hoped to find me, he foolishly stopped at an inn for some food . . . and who should he meet there, but one Bertha Jorkins, a witch from the Ministry of Magic. \"Now see the way that fate favors Lord Voldemort. This might have been the end of Wormtail, and of my last hope for regeneration. But Wormtail  displaying a presence of mind I would never have expected from him  convinced Bertha Jorkins to accompany him on a nighttime stroll. He overpowered her ... he brought her to me. And Bertha Jorkins, who might have ruined all, proved instead to be a gift beyond my wildest dreams ... for  with a little persuasion  she became a veritable mine of information. \"She told me that the Triwizard Tournament would be played at Hogwarts this year. She told me that she knew of a faithful Death Eater who would be only too willing to help me, if I could only contact him. She told me many things. . . but the means I used to break the Memory Charm upon her were powerful, and when I had extracted all useful information from her, her mind and body were both damaged beyond repair. She had now served her purpose. I could not possess her. I disposed of her.\" Voldemort smiled his terrible smile, his red eyes blank and pitiless. \"Wormtail's body, of course, was ill adapted for possession, as all assumed him dead, and would attract far too much attention if noticed. However, he was the ablebodied servant I needed, and, poor wizard though he is, Wormtail was able to follow the instructions I gave him, which would return me to a rudimentary, weak body of my own, a body I would be able to inhabit while awaiting the essential ingredients for true rebirth ... a spell or two of my own invention ... a little help from my dear Nagini,\" Voldemorts red eyes fell upon the continually circling snake, \"a potion concocted from unicorn blood, and the snake venom Nagini provided ... I was soon returned to an almost human form, and strong enough to travel. \"There was no hope of stealing the Sorcerer's Stone anymore, for I knew that Dumbledore would have seen to it that it was destroyed. But I was willing to embrace mortal life again, before chasing immortality. I set my sights lower ... I would settle for my old body back again, and my old strength. \"I knew that to achieve this  it is an old piece of Dark Magic, the potion that revived me tonight  I would need three powerful ingredients. Well, one of them was already at hand, was it not, Wormtail? Flesh given by a servant. . . . \"My father's bone, naturally, meant that we would have to come here, where he was buried. But the blood of a foe ... Wormtail would have had me use any wizard, would you not, Wormtail? Any wizard who had hated me ... as so many of them still do. But I knew the one I must use, if I was to rise again, more powerful than I had been when I had fallen. I wanted Harry Potters blood. I wanted the blood of the one who had stripped me of power thirteen years ago . . . for the lingering protection his mother once gave him would then reside in my veins too. . \"But how to get at Harry Potter? For he has been better protected than I think even he knows, protected in ways devised by Dumbledore long ago, when it fell to him to arrange the boy's future. Dumbledore invoked an ancient magic, to ensure the boy's protection as long as he is in his relations' care. Not even I can touch him there. . . . Then, of course, there was the Quidditch World Cup. ... I thought his protection might be weaker there, away from his relations and Dumbledore, but I was not yet strong enough to attempt kidnap in the midst of a horde of Ministry wizards. And then, the boy would return to Hogwarts, where he is under the crooked nose of that Muggleloving fool from morning until night. So how could I take him! \"Why ... by using Bertha Jorkins's information, of course. Use my one faithful Death Eater, stationed at Hogwarts, to ensure that the boy's name was entered into the Goblet of Fire. Use my Death Eater to ensure that the boy won the tournament  that he touched the Triwizard Cup first  the cup which my Death Eater had turned into a Portkey, which would bring him here, beyond the reach of Dumbledore's help and protection, and into my waiting arms. And here he is ... the boy you all believed had been my downfall. ...\" Voldemort moved slowly forward and turned to face Harry. He raised his wand. \"Crucio!\" It was pain beyond anything Harry had ever experienced; his very bones were on fire; his head was surely splitting along his scar; his eyes were rolling madly in his head; he wanted it to end ... to black out... to die ... And then it was gone. He was hanging limply in the ropes binding him to the headstone of Voldemort's father, looking up into those bright red eyes through a kind of mist. The night was ringing with the sound of the Death Eaters' laughter. \"You see, I think, how foolish it was to suppose that this boy could ever have been stronger than me,\" said Voldemort. \"But I want there to be no mistake in anybody's mind. Harry Potter escaped me by a lucky chance. And I am now going to prove my power by killing him, here and now, in front of you all, when there is no Dumbledore to help him, and no mother to die for him. I will give him his chance. He will be allowed to fight, and you will be left in no doubt which of us is the stronger. Just a little longer, Nagini,\" he whispered, and the snake glided away through the grass to where the Death Eaters stood watching. \"Now untie him, Wormtail, and give him back his wand.\" \n",

            ": Flight of the Prince Harry felt as though he too were hurtling through space; it had not happened. . . . It could not have happened. ... \"Out of here, quickly,\" said Snape. He seized Malfoy by the scruff of the neck and forced him through the door ahead of the rest; Greyback and the squat brother and sister followed, the latter both panting excitedly. As they vanished through the door, Harry realized he could move again. What was now holding him paralyzed against the wall was not magic, but horror and shock. He threw the Invisibility Cloak aside as the brutal-faced Death Eater, last to leave the tower top, was disappearing through the door. \"Petrificus Totalus!\" The Death Eater buckled as though hit in the back with something solid and fell to the ground, rigid as a waxwork, but he had barely hit the floor when Harry was clambering over him and running down the darkened staircase. Terror tore at Harry;s heart. ... He had to get to Dumbledore and he had to catch Snape. ... Somehow the two things were linked. ... He could reverse what had happened if he had them both together. ... Dumbledore could not have died. ... He leapt the last ten steps of the spiral staircase and stopped where he landed, his wand raised. The dimly lit corridor was full of dust; half the ceiling seemed to have fallen in; and a battle was raging before him, but even as he attempted to make out who were fighting whom, he heard the hated voice shout, \"It's over, time to go!\" and saw Snape disappearing around the corner at the far end of the corridor; he and Malfoy seemed to have forced their way through the fight unscathed. As Harry plunged after them, one of the fighters detached themselves from the fray and flew at him: it was the werewolf, Fenrir. He was on top of Harry before Harry could raise his wand: Harry fell backward, with filthy matted hair in his face, the stench of sweat and blood filling his nose and mouth, hot greedy breath at his throat - \"Petrificus Totalus!\" Harry felt Fenrir collapse against him; with a stupendous effort he pushed the werewolf off and onto the floor as a jet of green light came flying toward him; he ducked and ran, headfirst, into the fight. His feet met something squashy and slippery on the floor and he stumbled: There were two bodies lying there, lying facedown in a pool of blood, but there was no time to investigate. Harry now saw red hair flying like flames in front of him: Ginny was locked in combat with the lumpy Death Eater, Amycus, who was throwing hex after hex at her while she dodged them: Amycus was giggling, enjoying the sport: \"Crucio - Crucio - you can't dance forever, pretty-\" \"Impedimenta!\" yelled Harry. His jinx hit Amycus in the chest: He gave a piglike squeal of pain, was lifted off his feet and slammed into the opposite wall, slid down it, and fell out of sight behind Ron, Professor McGonagall, and Lupin, each of whom was battling a separate Death Eater. Beyond them, Harry saw Tonks fighting an enormous blond wizard who was sending curses flying in all directions, so that they ricocheted off the walls around them, cracking stone, shattering the nearest window - \"Harry, where did you come from?\" Ginny cried, but there was no time to answer her. He put his head down and sprinted forward, narrowly avoiding a blast that erupted over his head, showering them all in bits of wall. Snape must not escape, he must catch up with Snape - \"Take that!\" shouted Professor McGonagall, and Harry glimpsed the female Death Eater, Alecto, sprinting away down the corridor with her arms over her head, her brother right behind her. He launched himself after them but his foot caught on something, and next moment he was lying across someone's legs. Looking around, he saw Neville's pale, round face flat against the floor. \"Neville, are you - ?\" \"M'all right,\" muttered Neville, who was clutching his stomach, \"Harry . . . Snape 'n' Malfoy . . . ran past. . .\" \"I know, I'm on it!\" said Harry, aiming a hex from the floor at the enormous blond Death Eater who was causing most of the chaos. The man gave a howl of pain as the spell hit him in the face: He wheeled around, staggered, and then pounded away after the brother and sister. Harry scrambled up from the floor and began to sprint along the corridor, ignoring the bangs issuing from behind him, the yells of the others to come back, and the mute call of the figures on the ground whose fate he did not yet know. . . . He skidded around the corner, his trainers slippery with blood; Snape had an immense head start. Was it possible that he had already entered the cabinet in the Room of Requirement, or had the Order made steps to secure it, to prevent the Death Eaters retreating that way? He could hear nothing but his own pounding feet, his own hammering heart as he sprinted along the next empty corridor, but then spotted a bloody footprint that showed at least one of the fleeing Death Eaters was heading toward the front doors - perhaps the Room of Requirement was indeed blocked - He skidded around another corner and a curse flew past him; he dived behind a suit of armor that exploded. He saw the brother and sister running down the marble staircase ahead and aimed jinxes at them, but merely hit several bewigged witches in a portrait on the landing, who ran screeching into neighboring paintings. As he leapt the wreckage of armor, Harry heard more shouts and screams; other people within the castle seemed to have awoken. . . . He pelted toward a shortcut, hoping to overtake the brother and sister and close in on Snape and Malfoy, who must surely have reached the grounds by now. Remembering to leap the vanishing step halfway down the concealed staircase, he burst through a tapestry at the bottom and out into a corridor where a number of bewildered and pajama-clad Hufflepuffs stood. \"Harry! We heard a noise, and someone said something aboui the Dark Mark -\" began Ernie Macmillan. \"Out of the way!\" yelled Harry, knocking two boys aside as he sprinted toward the landing and down the remainder of the marble staircase. The oak front doors had been blasted open, there were smears of blood on the flagstones, and several terrified students stood huddled against the walls, one or two still cowering with their arms over their faces. The giant Gryffindor hourglass had been hit by a curse, and the rubies within were still falling, with a loud rattle, onto the flagstones below. Harry flew across the entrance hall and out into the dark grounds: He could just make out three figures racing across the lawn, heading for the gates beyond which they could Disapparate - by the looks of them, the huge blond Death Eater and, some way ahead of him, Snape and Malfoy. ... The cold night air ripped at Harry's lungs as he tore after them; he saw a flash of light in the distance that momentarily silhouetted his quarry. He did not know what it was but continued to run, not yet near enough to get a good aim with a curse - Another flash, shouts, retaliatory jets of light, and Harry understood: Hagrid had emerged from his cabin and was trying to stop the Death Eaters escaping, and though every breath seemed to shred his lungs and the stitch in his chest was like fire, Harry sped up as an unbidden voice in his head said: not Hagrid. . . not Hagrid too . . . Something caught Harry hard in the small of the back and he fell forward, his face smacking the ground, blood pouring out of both nostrils: He knew, even as he rolled over, his wand ready, that the brother and sister he had overtaken using his shortcut were closing in behind him. . . . \"Impedimenta!\" he yelled as he rolled over again, crouching close to the dark ground, and miraculously his jinx hit one of them, who stumbled and fell, tripping up the other; Harry leapt to his feet and sprinted on after Snape. And now he saw the vast outline of Hagrid, illuminated by the light of the crescent moon revealed suddenly behind clouds; the blond Death Eater was aiming curse after curse at the gamekeeper; but Hagrids immense strength and the toughened skin he had inherited from his giantess mother seemed to be protecting him. Snape and Malfoy, however, were still running; they would soon be beyond the gates, able to Disapparate - Harry tore past Hagrid and his opponent, took aim at Snape's back, and yelled, \"Stupefy!\" He missed; the jet of red light soared past Snape's head; Snape shouted, \"Run, Draco!\"and turned. Twenty yards apart, he and Harry looked at each other before raising their wands simultaneously. \"Cruc - \" But Snape parried the curse, knocking Harry backward off his feet before he could complete it; Harry rolled over and scrambled back up again as the huge Death Eater behind him yelled, \"Incendio!\" Harry heard an explosive bang and a dancing orange light spilled over all of them: Hagrid's house was on fire. \"Fang's in there, yer evil - !\" Hagrid bellowed. \"Cruc -\" yelled Harry for the second time, aiming for the figure ahead illuminated in the dancing firelight, but Snape blocked the spell again. Harry could see him sneering. \"No Unforgivable Curses from you, Potter!\" he shouted over the rushing of the flames, Hagrid's yells, and the wild yelping of the trapped Fang. \"You haven't got the nerve or the ability -\" \"Incarc-\"Harry roared, but Snape deflected the spell with an almost lazy flick of his arm. \"Fight back!\" Harry screamed at him. \"Fight back, you cowardly-----\" \"Coward, did you call me, Potter?\" shouted Snape. \"Your father would never attack me unless it was four on one, what would you call him, I wonder?\" \"Stupe-\" \"Blocked again and again and again until you learn to keep your mouth shut and your mind closed, Potter!\" sneered Snape, deflecting the curse once more. \"Now come!\" he shouted at the huge Death Eater behind Harry. \"It is time to be gone, before the Ministry turns up -\" \"Impedi -\" But before he could finish this jinx, excruciating pain hit Harry; he keeled over in the grass. Someone was screaming, he would surely die of this agony, Snape was going to torture him to death or madness - \"No!\" roared Snape's voice and the pain stopped as suddenly as it had started; Harry lay curled on the dark grass, clutching his wand and panting; somewhere overhead Snape was shouting, \"Have you forgotten our orders? Potter belongs to the Dark Lord - we are to leave him! Go! Go!\" And Harry felt the ground shudder under his face as the brother and sister and the enormous Death Eater obeyed, running toward the gates. Harry uttered an inarticulate yell of rage: In that instant, he cared not whether he lived or died. Pushing himself to his feet again, he staggered blindly toward Snape, the man he now hated as much as he hated Voldemort himself - \"Sectum - \" Snape flicked his wand and the curse was repelled yet again; but Harry was mere feet away now and he could see Snape's face clearly at last: He was no longer sneering or jeering; the blazing flames showed a face full of rage. Mustering all his powers of concentration, Harry thought, Levi - \"No, Potter!\" screamed Snape. There was a loud BANG and Harry was soaring backward, hitting the ground hard again, ;un\\ this time his wand flew out of his hand. He could hear Hagrid yelling and Fang howling as Snape closed in and looked down on him where he lay, wandless and defenseless as Dumbledore hadl been. Snape's pale face, illuminated by the flaming cabin, was suffused with hatred just as it had been before he had cursed Dumbledore. \"You dare use my own spells against me, Potter? It was I who invented them - I, the Half-Blood Prince! And you'd turn my inventions on me, like your filthy father, would you? I don't think so . . . no\" Harry had dived for his wand; Snape shot a hex at it and it flew feet away into the darkness and out of sight. \"Kill me then,\" panted Harry, who felt no fear at all, but only rage and contempt. \"Kill me like you killed him, you coward -\" \"DON'T -\" screamed Snape, and his face was suddenly demented, inhuman, as though he was in as much pain as the yelping, howling dog stuck in the burning house behind them - \"CALL ME COWARD!\" And he slashed at the air: Harry felt a white-hot, whiplike something hit him across the face and was slammed backward into the ground. Spots of light burst in front of his eyes and for a moment all the breath seemed to have gone from his body, then he heard a rush of wings above him and something enormous obscured the stars. Buckbeak had flown at Snape, who staggered backward as the razor-sharp claws slashed at him. As Harry raised himself into a sitting position, his head still swimming from its last contact with the ground, he saw Snape running as hard as he could, the enormous beast flapping behind him and screeching as Harry had never heard him screech - Harry struggled to his feet, looking around groggily for his wand, hoping to give chase again, but even as his fingers fumbled in the grass, discarding twigs, he knew it would be too late, and sure enough, by the time he had located his wand, he turned only to see the hippogriff circling the gates. Snape had managed to Disapparate just beyond the school's boundaries. \"Hagrid,\" muttered Harry, still dazed, looking around. \"HAGRID?\" He stumbled toward the burning house as an enormous figure emerged from out of the flames carrying Fang on his back. With a cry of thankfulness, Harry sank to his knees; he was shaking in every limb, his body ached all over, and his breath came in painful stabs. \"Yeh all righ', Harry? Yeh all righ'? Speak ter me, Harry. . ..\" Hagrids huge, hairy face was swimming above Harry, blocking out the stars. Harry could smell burnt wood and dog hair; he put out a hand and felt Fang's reassuringly warm and alive body quivering beside him. \"I'm all right,\" panted Harry. \"Are you?\" \"'Course I am . . . take more'n that ter finish me.\" Hagrid put his hands under Harry's arms and raised him up with such force that Harry's feet momentarily left the ground before Hagrid set him upright again. He could see blood trickling down Hagrid's cheek from a deep cut under one eye, which was swelling rapidly. \"We should put out your house,\" said Harry, \"the charm's 'Aguamenti' ...\" \"Knew it was summat like that,\" mumbled Hagrid, and he raised a smoldering pink, flowery umbrella and said, \"Aguamenti!\" A jet of water flew out of the umbrella tip. Harry raised his wand arm, which felt like lead, and murmured \"Aguamenti\" too: Together, he and Hagrid poured water on the house until the last flame was extinguished. \"S'not too bad,\" said Hagrid hopefully a few minutes later, looking at the smoking wreck. \"Nothin Dumbledore won' be able to put righ' . . .\" Harry felt a searing pain in his stomach at the sound of the name. In the silence and the stillness, horror rose inside him. \"Hagrid ...\" \"I was bindin' up a couple o' bowtruckle legs when I heard 'em coming,\" said Hagrid sadly, still staring at his wrecked cabin. \"They'll bin burnt ter twigs, poor little things. . . .\" \"Hagrid . . .\" \"But what happened, Harry? I jus' saw them Death Eaters run-nin down from the castle, but what the ruddy hell was Snape doin' with 'em? Where's he gone - was he chasin' them?\" \"He . . .\" Harry cleared his throat; it was dry from panic and the smoke. \"Hagrid, he killed . . .\" \"Killed?\" said Hagrid loudly, staring down at Harry. \"Snape killed? What're yeh on abou', Harry?\" \"Dumbledore,\" said Harry. \"Snape killed .. . Dumbledore.\" Hagrid simply looked at him, the little of his face that could be seen completely blank, uncomprehending. \"Dumbledore wha, Harry?\" \"He's dead. Snape killed him....\" \"Don' say that,\" said Hagrid roughly. \"Snape kill Dumbledore - don' be stupid, Harry. Wha's made yeh say tha'?\" \"I saw it happen.\" , ,.. \"Yeh couldn' have.\" \"I saw it, Hagrid.\" Hagrid shook his head; his expression was disbelieving but sympathetic, and Harry knew that Hagrid thought he had sustained a blow to the head, that he was confused, perhaps by the aftereffects of a jinx. ... \"What musta happened was, Dumbledore musta told Snape ter go with them Death Eaters,\" Hagrid said confidently. \"I suppose he's gotta keep his cover. Look, let's get yeh back up ter the school. Come on, Harry. ...\" Harry did not attempt to argue or explain. He was still shaking uncontrollably. Hagrid would find out soon enough, too soon. ... As they directed their steps back toward the castle, Harry saw that many of its windows were lit now. He could imagine, clearly, the scenes inside as people moved from room to room, telling each other that Death Eaters had got in, that the Mark was shining over Hogwarts, that somebody must have been killed. . . . The oak front doors stood open ahead of them, light flooding out onto the drive and the lawn. Slowly, uncertainly, dressing-gowned people were creeping down the steps, looking around nervously for some sign of the Death Eaters who had fled into the night. Harry's eyes, however, were fixed upon the ground at the foot of the tallest tower. He imagined that he could see a black, huddled mass lying in the grass there, though he was really too far away to see anything of the sort. Even as he stared wordlessly at the place where he thought Dumbledore's body must lie, however, he saw people beginning to move toward it. \"What're they all lookin' at?\" said Hagrid, as he and Harry approached the castle front, Fang keeping as close as he could to their ankles. \"Wha's that lyin' on the grass?\" Hagrid added sharply, heading now toward the foot of the Astronomy Tower, where a small crowd was congregating. \"See it, Harry? Right at the foot of the tower? Under where the Mark . . . Blimey . . . yeh don' think someone got thrown - ?\" Hagrid fell silent, the thought apparently too horrible to express aloud. Harry walked alongside him, feeling the aches and pains in his face and his legs where the various hexes of the last half hour had hit him, though in an oddly detached way, as though somebody near him was suffering them. What was real and inescapable was the awful pressing feeling in his chest. . . . He and Hagrid moved, dreamlike, through the murmuring crowd to the very front, where the dumbstruck students and teachers had left a gap. Harry heard Hagrid's moan of pain and shock, but he did not stop; he walked slowly forward until he reached the place where Dumbledore lay and crouched down beside him. He had known there was no hope from the moment that the full Body-Bind Curse Dumbledore had placed upon him lifted, known that it could have happened only because its caster was dead, but there was still no preparation for seeing him here, spread-eagled, broken: the greatest wizard Harry had ever, or would ever, meet. Dumbledore's eyes were closed; but for the strange angle of his arms and legs, he might have been sleeping. Harry reached out, straightened the half-moon spectacles upon the crooked nose, and wiped a trickle of blood from the mouth with his own sleeve. Then he gazed down at the wise old face and tried to absorb the enormous and incomprehensible truth: that never again would Dumbledore speak to him, never again could he help----- The crowd murmured behind Harry. After what seemed like a long time, he became aware that he was kneeling upon something hard and looked down. The locket they had managed to steal so many hours before had fallen out of Dumbledore's pocket. It had opened, perhaps due to the force with which it hit the ground. And although he could not feel more shock or horror or sadness than he felt already, Harry knew, as he picked it up, that there was something wrong----- He turned the locket over in his hands. This was neither as large as the locket he remembered seeing in the Pensieve, nor were there any markings upon it, no sign of the ornate S that was supposed to be Slytherins mark. Moreover, there was nothing inside but for a scrap of folded parchment wedged tightly into the place where a portrait should have been. Automatically, without really thinking about what he was doing, Harry pulled out the fragment of parchment, opened it, and read by the light of the many wands that had now been lit behind him: To the Dark Lord I now I will be dead long before you read this but I want you to know that it was I who dicovered your secret. I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can. I face death in the hope that when you meet your match you will be mortal once more. R.A.B. Harry neither knew nor cared what the message meant. Only one thing mattered: This was not a Horcrux. Dumbledore had weakened himself by drinking that terrible potion for nothing. Harry crumpled the parchment in his hand, and his eyes burned with tears as behind him Fang began to howl. \n",

            " The Bribe If Kreacher could escape a lake full of Inferi, Harry was confident that the capture of Mundungus would take a few hours at most, and he prowled the house all morning in a state of high anticipation. However, Kreacher did not return that morning or even that afternoon. By nightfall, Harry felt discouraged and anxious, and a supper composed largely of moldy bread, upon which Hermione had tried a variety of unsuccessful Transfigurations, did nothing to help. Kreacher did not return the following day, nor the day after that. However, two cloaked men had appeared in the square outside number twelve, and they remained there into the night, gazing in the direction of the house that they could not see. \"Death Eaters, for sure,\" said Ron, as he, Harry, and Hermione watched from the drawing room windows. \"Reckon they know we’re in here?\" \"I don’t think so,\" said Hermione, though she looked frightened, \"or they’d have sent Snape in after us, wouldn’t they?\" \"D’you reckon he’s been in here and has his tongue tied by Moody’s curse?\" asked Ron. \"Yes,\" said Hermione, \"otherwise he’d have been able to tell that lot how to get in, wouldn’t he? But they’re probably watching to see whether we turn up. They know that Harry owns the house, after all.\" \"How do they --?\" began Harry. \"Wizarding wills are examined by the Ministry, remember? They’ll know Sirius left you the place.\" The presence of the Death Eaters outside increased the ominous mood inside number twelve. They had not heard a word form anyone beyond Grimmauld Place since Mr. Weasley’s Patronus, and the strain was starting to tell. Restless and irritable, Ron had developed an annoying habit of playing with the Deluminator in his pocket; This particularly infuriated Hermione, who was whiling away the wait for Kreacher by studying The Tales of Beedle the Bard and did not appreciate the way the lights kept flashing on and off. \"Will you stop it!\" she cried on the third evening of Kreacher’s absence, as all the light was sucked from the drawing room yet again. \"Sorry, sorry!\" said Ron, clicking the Deluminator and restoring the lights. \"I don’t know I’m doing it!\" \"Well, can’t you find something useful to occupy yourself?\" \"What, like reading kids’ stories?\" \"Dumbledore left me this book, Ron -\" \"-and he left me the Deluminator, maybe I’m supposed to use it!\" Unable to stand the bickering, Harry slipped out of the room unnoticed by either of them. He headed downstairs toward the kitchen, which he kept visiting because he was sure that was where Kreacher was most likely to reappear. Halfway down the flight of stairs into the hall, however, he heard a tap on the front door, then metallic clicks and the grinding of the chain. Every nerve in his body seemed to tauten: He pulled out his wand, moved into the shadows beside the decapitated elf heads, and waited. The door opened: He saw a glimpse of the lamplit square outside, and a cloaked figure edged into the hall and closed the door behind it. The intruder took a step forward, and Moody’s voice asked, \"Severus Snape?\" Then the dust figure rose from the end of the hall and rushed him, raising its dead hand. \"It was not I who killed you, Albus,\" said a quiet voice. The jinx broke: The dust-figure exploded again, and it was impossible to make out the newcomer through the dense gray cloud it left behind. Harry pointed the wand into the middle of it. \"Don’t move!\" He had forgotten the portrait of Mrs. Black: At the sound of his yell, the curtains hiding her flew open and she began to scream, \"Mudbloods and filth dishonoring my house -\" Ron and Hermione came crashing down the stairs behind Harry, wands pointing, like his, at the unknown man now standing with his arms raised in the hall below. \"Hold your fire, it’s me, Remus!\" \"Oh, thank goodness,\" said Hermione weakly, pointing her wand at Mrs. Black instead; with a bang, the curtains swished shut again and silence fell. Ron too lowered his wand, but Harry did not. \"Show yourself!\" he called back. Lupin moved forward into the lamplight, hands still held high in a gesture of surrender. \"I am Remus John Lupin, werewolf, sometimes known as Moony, one of the four creators of the Marauder’s Map, married to Nymphadora, usually known as Tonks, and I taught you how to produce a Patronus, Harry, which takes the form of a stag.\" \"Oh, all right,\" said Harry, lowering his wand, \"but I had to check, didn’t I?\" \"Speaking as your ex-Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, I quite agree that you had to check. Ron, Hermione, you shouldn’t be so quick to lower your defenses.\" They ran down the stairs towards him. Wrapped in a thick black traveling cloak, he looked exhausted, but pleased to see them. \"No sign of Severus, then?\" he asked. \"No,\" said Harry. \"What’s going on? Is everyone okay?’ \"Yes,\" said Lupin, \"but we’re all being watched. There are a couple of Death Eaters in the square outside -\" \"We know -\" \"I had to Apparate very precisely onto the top step outside the front door to be sure that they would not see me. They can’t know you’re in here or I’m sure they’d have more people out there; they’re staking out everywhere that’s got any connection with you, Harry. Let’s go downstairs, there’s a lot to tell you, and I want to know what happened after you left the Burrow.\" They descended into the kitchen, where Hermione pointed her wand at the grate. A fire sprang up instantly: It gave the illusion of coziness to the stark stone walls and glistened off the long wooden table. Lupin pulled a few butterbeers from beneath his traveling cloak and they sat down. \"I’d have been here three days ago but I needed to shake off the Death Eater tailing me,\" said Lupin. \"So, you came straight here after the wedding?\" \"No,\" said Harry, \"only after we ran into a couple of Death Eaters in a café on Tottenham Court Road.\" Lupin slopped most of his butterbeer down his front. \"What?\" They explained what had happened; when they had finished, Lupin looked aghast. \"But how did they find you so quickly? It’s impossible to track anyone who Apparates, unless you grab hold of them as they disappear.\" \"And it doesn’t seem likely they were just strolling down Tottenham Court Road at the time, does it?\" said Harry. \"We wondered,\" said Hermione tentatively, \"whether Harry could still have the Trace on him?\" \"Impossible,\" said Lupin. Ron looked smug, and Harry felt hugely relieved. \"Apart from anything else, they’d know for sure Harry was here if he still had the Trace on him, wouldn’t they? But I can’t see how they could have tracked you to Tottenham Court Road, that’s worrying, really worrying.\" He looked disturbed, but as far as Harry was concerned, that question could wait. \"Tell us what happened after we left, we haven’t heard a thing since Ron’s dad told us the family was safe.\" \"Well, Kingsley saved us,\" said Lupin. \"Thanks to his warning most of the wedding guests were able to Disapparate before they arrived.\" \"Were they Death Eaters or Ministry people?\" interjected Hermione. \"A mixture; but to all intents and purposes they’re the same thing now,\" said Lupin. \"There were about a dozen of them, but they didn’t know you were there, Harry. Arthur heard a rumor that they tried to torture your whereabouts out of Scrimgeour before they killed him; if it’s true, he didn’t give you away.\" Harry looked at Ron and Hermione; their expressions reflected the mingled shock and gratitude he felt. He had never liked Scrimgeour much, but if what Lupin said was true, the man’s final act had been to try to protect Harry. \"The Death Eaters searched the Burrow from top to bottom,\" Lupin went on. \"They found the ghoul, but didn’t want to get too close - and then they interrogated those of us who remained for hours. They were trying to get information on you, Harry, but of course nobody apart from the Order knew that you had been there. \"At the same time that they were smashing up the wedding, more Death Eaters were forcing their way into every Order-connected house in the country. No deaths,\" he added quickly, forestalling the question, \"but they were rough. They burned down Dedalus Diggle’s house, but as you know he wasn’t there, and they used the Cruciarus Curse on Tonks’s family. Again, trying to find out where you went after you visited them. They’re all right - shaken, obviously, but otherwise okay.\" \"The Death Eaters got through all those protective charms?\" Harry asked, remembering how effective these had been on the night he had crashed in Tonks’s parents’ garden. \"What you’ve got to realize, Harry, is that the Death Eaters have got the full might of the Ministry on their side now,\" said Lupin. \"They’ve got the power to perform brutal spells without fear of identification or arrest. They managed to penetrate every defensive spell we’d cast against them, and once inside, they were completely open about why they’d come.\" \"And are they bothering to give an excuse for torturing Harry’s whereabouts out of people?\" asked Hermione, an edge to her voice. \"Well,\" Lupin said. He hesitated, then pulled out a folded copy of the Daily Prophet. \"Here,\" he said, pushing it across the table to Harry, \"you’ll know sooner or later anyway. That’s their pretext for going after you.\" Harry smoothed out the paper. A huge photograph of his own face filled the front page. He read the headline over it: WANTED FOR QUESTIONING ABOUT THE DEATH OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE Ron and Hermione gave roars of outrage, but Harry said nothing. He pushed the newspaper away; he did not want to read anymore: He knew what it would say. Nobody but those who had been on top of the tower when Dumbledore died knew who had really killed him and, as Rita Skeeter had already told the Wizarding world, Harry had been seen running from the place moments after Dumbledore had fallen. \"I’m sorry, Harry,\" Lupin said. \"So Death Eaters have taken over the Daily Prophet too?\" asked Hermione furiously. Lupin nodded. \"But surely people realize what’s going on?\" \"The coup has been smooth and virtually silent,\" said Lupin. \"The official version of Scrimgeour’s murder is that he resigned; he has been replaced by Pius Thicknesse, who is under the Imperius Curse.\" \"Why didn’t Voldemort declare himself Minister of Magic?\" asked Ron. Lupin laughed. \"He doesn’t need to, Ron. Effectively, he is the Minister, but why should he sit behind a desk at the Ministry? His puppet, Thicknesse, is taking care of everyday business, leaving Voldemort free to extend his power beyond the Ministry. \"Naturally many people have deduced what has happened: There has been such a dramatic change in Ministry policy in the last few days, and many are whispering that Voldemort must be behind it. However, that is the point: They whisper. They daren’t confide in each other, not knowing whom to trust; they are scared to speak out, in case their suspicions are true and their families are targeted. Yes, Voldemort is playing a very clever game. Declaring himself might have provoked open rebellion: Remaining masked has created confusion, uncertainty, and fear.\" \"And this dramatic change in Ministry policy,\" said Harry, \"involves warning the Wizarding world against me instead of Voldemort?\" \"That’s certainly a part of it,\" said Lupin, \"and it is a masterstroke. Now that Dumbledore is dead, you - the Boy Who Lived - were sure to be the symbol and rallying point for any resistance to Voldemort. But by suggesting that you had a hand in the old hat’s death, Voldemort has not only set a price upon your head, but sown doubt and fear amongst many who would have defended you. \"Meanwhile, the Ministry has started moving against Muggle-borns.\" Lupin pointed at the Daily Prophet. \"Look at page two.\" Hermione turned the pages with much the same expression of distaste she had when handling Secrets of the Darkest Art. \"Muggle-born Register!\" she read aloud. \"‘The Ministry of Magic is undertaking a survey of so-called \"Muggle-borns\" the better to understand how they came to possess magical secrets. \"‘Recent research undertaken by the Department of Mysteries reveals that magic can only be passed from person to person when Wizards reproduce. Where no proven Wizarding ancestry exists, therefore, the so-called Muggle-born is likely to have obtained magical power by theft or force. \"‘The Ministry is determined to root out such usurpers of magical power, and to this end has issued an invitation to every so-called Muggle-born to present themselves for interview by the newly appointed Muggle-born Registration Commission.’\" \"People won’t let this happen,\" said Ron. \"It is happening, Ron,\" said Lupin. \"Muggle-borns are being rounded up as we speak.\" \"But how are they supposed to have ‘stolen’ magic?\" said Ron. \"It’s mental, if you could steal magic there wouldn’t be any Squibs, would there?\" \"I know,\" said Lupin. \"Nevertheless, unless you can prove that you have at least one close Wizarding relative, you are now deemed to have obtained your magical power illegally and must suffer the punishment.\" Ron glanced at Hermione, then said, \"What if purebloods and halfbloods swear a Muggle-born’s part of their family? I’ll tell everyone Hermione’s my cousin -\" Hermione covered Ron’s hand with hers and squeezed it. \"Thank you, Ron, but I couldn’t let you -\" \"You won’t have a choice,\" said Ron fiercely, gripping her hand back. \"I’ll teach you my family tree so you can answer questions on it.\" Hermione gave a shaky laugh. \"Ron, as we’re on the run with Harry Potter, the most wanted person in the country, I don’t think it matters. If I was going back to school it would be different. What’s Voldemort planning for Hogwarts?\" she asked Lupin. \"Attendance is now compulsory for every young witch and wizard,\" he replied. \"That was announced yesterday. It’s a change, because it was never obligatory before. Of course, nearly every witch and wizard in Britain has been educated at Hogwarts, but their parents had the right to teach them at home or send them abroad if they preferred. This way, Voldemort will have the whole Wizarding population under his eye from a young age. And it’s also another way of weeding out Muggle-borns, because students must be given Blood Status - meaning that they have proven to the Ministry that they are of Wizard descent - before they are allowed to attend.\" Harry felt sickened and angry: At this moment, excited eleven-year-olds would be poring over stacks of newly purchased spell-books, unaware that they would never see Hogwarts, perhaps never see their families again either. \"It’s . . . it’s . . .\" he muttered, struggling to find words that did justice to the horror of his thoughts, but Lupin said quietly, \"I know.\" Lupin hesitated. I’ll understand if you can’t confirm this, Harry, but the Order is under the impression that Dumbledore left you a mission.\" \"He did,\" Harry replied, \"and Ron and Hermione are in on it and they’re coming with me.\" \"Can you confide in me what the mission is?\" Harry looked into the prematurely lined face, framed in thick but graying hair, and wished that he could return a different answer. \"I can’t, Remus, I’m sorry. If Dumbledore didn’t tell you I don’t think I can.\" \"I thought you’d say that,\" said Lupin, looking disappointed. \"But I might still be of some use to you. You know what I am and what I can do. I could come with you to provide protection. There would be no need to tell me exactly what you were up to.\" Harry hesitated. It was a very tempting offer, though how they would be able to keep their mission secret from Lupin if he were with them all the time he could not imagine. Hermione, however, looked puzzled. \"But what about Tonks?\" she asked. \"What about her?\" said Lupin. \"Well,\" said Hermione, frowning, \"you’re married! How does she feel about you going away with us?\" \"Tonks will be perfectly safe,\" said Lupin, \"She’ll be at her parents’ house.\" There was something strange in Lupin’s tone, it was almost cold. There was also something odd in the idea of Tonks remaining hidden at her parents’ house; she was, after all, a member of the Order and, as far as Harry knew, was likely to want to be in the thick of the action. \"Remus,\" said Hermione tentatively, \"is everything all right . . . you know . . . between you and - \" \"Everything is fine, thank you,\" said Lupin pointedly. Hermione turned pink. There was another pause, an awkward and embarrassed one, and then Lupin said, with an air of forcing himself to admit something unpleasant, \"Tonks is going to have a baby.\" \"Oh, how wonderful!\" squealed Hermione. \"Excellent!\" said Ron enthusiastically. \"Congratulations,\" said Harry. Lupin gave an artificial smile that was more like a grimace, then said, \"So . . . do you accept my offer? Will three become four? I cannot believe that Dumbledore would have disapproved, he appointed me your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, after all. And I must tell you that I believe we are facing magic many of us have never encountered or imagined.\" Ron and Hermione both looked at Harry. \"Just - just to be clear,\" he said. \"You want to leave Tonks at her parents’ house and come away with us?\" \"She’ll be perfectly safe there, they’ll look after her,\" said Lupin. He spoke with a finality bordering on indifference: \"Harry, I’m sure James would have wanted me to stick with you.\" \"Well,\" said Harry slowly, \"I’m not. I’m pretty sure my father would have wanted to know why you aren’t sticking with your own kid, actually.\" Lupin’s face drained of color. The temperature in the kitchen might have dropped ten degrees. Ron stared around the room as though he had been bidden to memorize it, while Hermione’s eyes swiveled backward and forward from Harry to Lupin. \"You don’t understand,\" said Lupin at last. \"Explain, then,\" said Harry. Lupin swallowed. \"I - I made a grave mistake in marrying Tonks. I did it against my better judgment and have regretted it very much every since.\" \"I see,\" said Harry, \"so you’re just going to dump her and the kid and run off with us?\" Lupin sprang to his feet: His chair toppled over backward, and he glared at them so fiercely that Harry saw, for the first time ever, she shadow of the wolf upon his human face. \"Don’t you understand what I’ve done to my wife and my unborn child? I should never have married her, I’ve made her an outcast!\" Lupin kicked aside the chair he had overturned. \"You have only ever seen me amongst the Order, or under Dumbledore’s protection at Hogwarts! You don’t know how most of the Wizarding world sees creatures like me! When they know of my affliction, they can barely talk to me! Don’t you see what I’ve done? Even her own family is disgusted by our marriage, what parents want their only daughter to marry a werewolf? And the child - the child - \" Lupin actually seized handfuls of his own hair; he looked quite deranged. \"My kind don’t usually breed! It will be like me, I am convinced of it - how can I forgive myself, when I knowingly risked passing on my own condition to an innocent child? And if, by some miracle, it is not like me, then it will be better off, a hundred times so, without a father of whom it must always be ashamed!\" \"Remus!\" whispered Hermione, tears in her eyes. \"Don’t say that - how could any child be ashamed of you?\" \"Oh, I don’t know, Hermione,\" said Harry. \"I’d be pretty ashamed of him.\" Harry did not know where his rage was coming from, but it had propelled him to his feet too. Lupin looked as though Harry had hit him. \"If the new regime thinks Muggle-borns are bad,\" Harry said, \"what will they do to a half-werewolf whose father’s in the Order? My father died trying to protect my mother and me, and you reckon he’d tell you to abandon your kid to go on an adventure with us?\" \"How - how dare you?\" said Lupin. \"This is not about a desire for - for danger or personal glory - how dare you suggest such a - \" \"I think you’re feeling a bit of a daredevil,\" Harry said, \"You fancy stepping into Sirius’s shoes -\" \"Harry, no!\" Hermione begged him, but he continued to glare into Lupin’s livid face. \"I’d never have believed this,\" Harry said. \"The man who taught me to fight dementors - a coward.\" Lupin drew his wand so fast that Harry had barely reached for his own; there was a loud bang and he felt himself flying backward as if punched; as he slammed into the kitchen wall and slid to the floor, he glimpsed the tail of Lupin’s cloak disappearing around the door. \"Remus, Remus, come back!\" Hermione cried, but Lupin did not respond. A moment later they heard the front door slam. \"Harry!\" wailed Hermione. \"How could you?\" \"It was easy,\" said Harry. He stood up, he could feel a lump swelling where his head had hit the wall. He was still so full of anger he was shaking. \"Don’t look at me like that!\" he snapped at Hermione. \"Don’t you start on her!\" snarled Ron. \"No - no - we mustn’t fight!\" said Hermione, launching herself between them. \"You shouldn’t have said that stuff to Lupin,\" Ron told Harry. \"He had it coming to him,\" said Harry. Broken images were racing each other through his mind: Sirius falling through the veil; Dumbledore suspended, broken, in midair; a flash of green light and his mother’s voice, begging for mercy . . . \"Parents,\" said Harry, \"shouldn’t leave their kids unless - unless they’ve got to.\" \"Harry -\" said Hermione, stretching out a consoling hand, but he shrugged it off and walked away, his eyes on the fire Hermione had conjured. He had once spoken to Lupin out of that fireplace, seeking reassurance about James, and Lupin had consoled him. Now Lupin’s tortured white face seemed to swim in the air before him. He felt a sickening surge of remorse. Neither Ron nor Hermione spoke, but Harry felt sure that they were looking at each other behind his back, communicating silently. He turned around and caught them turning hurriedly away form each other. \"I know I shouldn’t have called him a coward.\" \"No, you shouldn’t,\" said Ron at once. \"But he’s acting like one.\" \"All the same . . .\" said Hermione. \"I know,\" said Harry. \"But if it makes him go back to Tonks, it’ll be worth it, won’t it?\" He could not keep the plea out of his voice. Hermione looked sympathetic, Ron uncertain. Harry looked down at his feet, thinking of his father. Would James have backed Harry in what he had said to Lupin, or would he have been angry at how his son had treated his old friend? The silent kitchen seemed to hum with the shock of the recent scene and with Ron and Hermione’s unspoken reproaches. The Daily Prophet Lupin had brought was still lying on the table, Harry’s own face staring up at the ceiling from the front page. He walked over to it and sat down, opened the paper at random, and pretended to read. He could not take in the words; his mind was still too full of the encounter with Lupin. He was sure that Ron and Hermione had resumed their silent communications on the other side of the Prophet. He turned a page loudly, and Dumbledore’s name leapt out at him. It was a moment or two before he took in the meaning of the photograph, which showed a family group. Beneath the photograph were the words: The Dumbledore family, left to right: Albus; Percival, holding newborn Ariana; Kendra, and Aberforth. His attention caught, Harry examined the picture more carefully. Dumbledore’s father, Percival, was a good-looking man with eyes that seemed to twinkle even in this faded old photograph. The baby, Ariana, was a little longer than a loaf of bread and no more distinctive-looking. The mother, Kendra, had jet black hair pulled into a high bun. Her face had a carved quality about it. Harry thought of photos of Native Americans he’d seen as he studied her dark eyes, high cheekbones, and straight nose, formally composed above a high-necked silk gown. Albus and Aberforth wore matching lacy collared jackets and had identical, shoulder-length hairstyles. Albus looked several years older, but otherwise the two boys looked very alike, for this was before Albus’s nose had been broken and before he started wearing glasses. The family looked quite happy and normal, smiling serenely up out of the newspaper. Baby Ariana’s arm waved vaguely out of her shawl. Harry looked above the picture and saw the headline: EXCLUSIVE EXTRACT FROM UPCOMING BIOGRAPHY OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE by Rita Skeeter Thinking it could hardly make him feel any worse than he already did, Harry began to read: Proud and haughty, Kendra Dumbledore could not bear to remain in Mould-on-the-Wold after her husband Percival’s well-publicized arrest and imprisonment in Azkaban. She therefore decided to uproot the family and relocate to Godric’s Hollow, the village that was later to gain fame as the scene of Harry Potter’s strange escape from You-Know-Who. Like Mould-on-the-Wold, Godric’s Hollow was home to a number of Wizarding families, but as Kendra knew none of them, she would be spared the curiosity about her husband’s crime she had faced in her former village. By repeatedly rebuffing the friendly advances of her new Wizarding neighbors, she soon ensured that her family was left well alone. \"Slammed the door in my face when I went around to welcome her with a batch of homemade Cauldron Cakes,\" says Bathilda Bagshot. \"The first year they were there I only ever saw the two boys. Wouldn’t have known there was a daughter if I hadn’t been picking Plangentines by moonlight the winter after they moved in, and saw Kendra leading Ariana out into the back garden. Walked her round the lawn once, keeping a firm grip on her, then took her back inside. Didn’t know what to make of it.\" It seems that Kendra thought the move to Godric’s Hollow was the perfect opportunity to hide Ariana once and for all, something she had probably been planning for years. The timing was significant. Ariana was barely seven years old when she vanished from sight, and seven is the age by which most experts agree that magic will have revealed itself, if present. Nobody now alive remembers Ariana ever demonstrating even the slightest sign of magical ability. It seems clear, therefore, that Kendra made a decision to hide her daughter’s existence rather than suffer the shame of admitting that she had produced a Squib. Moving away from the friends and neighbors who knew Ariana would, of course, make imprisoning her all the easier. The tiny number of people who henceforth knew of Ariana’s existence could be counted upon to keep the secret, including her two brothers, who had deflected awkward questions with the answer their mother had taught them. \"My sister is too frail for school.\" Next week: Albus Dumbledore at Hogwarts - the Prizes and the Pretense. Harry had been wrong: What he had read had indeed made him feel worse. He looked back at the photograph of the apparently happy family. Was it true? How could he find out? He wanted to go to Godric’s Hollow, even if Bathilda was in no fit state to talk to him: he wanted to visit the place where he and Dumbledore had both lost loved ones. He was in the process of lowering the newspaper, to ask Ron’s and Hermione’s opinions, when a deafening crack echoed around the kitchen. For the first time in three days Harry had forgotten all about Kreacher. His immediate thought was that Lupin had burst back into the room, and for a split second, he did not take in the mass of struggling limbs that had appeared out of thin air right beside his chair. He hurried to his feet as Kreacher disentangled himself and, bowing low to Harry, croaked, \"Kreacher has returned with the thief Mundungus Fletcher, Master.\" Mundungus scrambled up and pulled out his wand; Hermione, however, was too quick for him. \"Expelliarmus!\" Mundungus’s wand soared into the air, and Hermione caught it. Wild-eyed, Mundungus dived for the stairs. Ron rugby-tackled him and Mundungus hit the stone floor with a muffled crunch. \"What?\" he bellowed, writhing in his attempts to free himself from Ron’s grip. \"Wha’ve I done? Setting a bleedin’ ‘house-elf on me, what are you playing at, wha’ve I done, lemme go, lemme go, of - \" \"You’re not in much of a position to make threats,\" said Harry. He threw aside the newspaper, crossed the kitchen in a few strides, and dropped to his knees beside Mundungus, who stopped struggling and looked terrified. Ron got up, panting, and watched as Harry pointed his wand deliberately at Mundungus’s nose. Mundungus stank of stale sweat and tobacco smoke. His hair was matted and his robes stained. \"Kreacher apologizes for the delay in bringing the thief, Master,\" croaked the elf. \"Fletcher knows how to avoid capture, has many hidey-holes and accomplices. Nevertheless, Kreacher cornered the thief in the end.\" \"You’ve done really well, Kreacher,\" said Harry, and the elf bowed low. \"Right, we’ve got a few questions for you,\" Harry told Mundungus, who shouted at once. \"I panicked, okay? I never wanted to come along, no offense, mate, but I never volunteered to die for you, an’ that was bleedin’ You-Know-Who come flying at me, anyone woulda got outta there. I said all along I didn’t wanna do it -\" \"For your information, none of the rest of us Disapparated,\" said Hermione. \"Well, you’re a bunch of bleedin’ ‘eroes then, aren’t you, but I never pretended I was up for killing meself -\" \"We’re not interested in why you ran out on Mad-Eye,\" said Harry, moving his wand a little closer to Mundungus’s baggy, bloodshot eyes. \"We already knew you were an unreliable bit of scum.\" \"Well then, why the ‘ell am I being ‘unted down by ‘ouse-elves? Or is this about them goblets again? I ain’t got none of ‘em left, or you could ‘ave ‘em -\" \"It’s not about the goblets either, although you’re getting warmer,\" said Harry. \"Shut up and listen.\" It felt wonderful to have something to do, someone of whom he could demand some small portion of truth. Harry’s wand was now so close to the bridge of Mundungus’s nose that Mundungus had gone cross-eyed trying to keep it in view. \"When you cleaned out this house of anything valuable,\" Harry began, but Mundungus interrupted him again. \"Sirius never cared about any of the junk -\" There was the sound of pattering fee, a blaze of shining copper, an echoing clang, and a shriek of agony; Kreacher had taken a run at Mundungus and hit him over the head with a saucepan. \"Call ‘im off, call ‘im off, ‘e should be locked up!\" screamed Mundungus, cowering as Kreacher raised the heavy-bottomed pan again. \"Kreacher, no!\" shouted Harry. Kreacher’s thin arms trembled with the weight of the pan, still held aloft. \"Perhaps just one more, Master Harry, for luck?\" Ron laughed. \"We need him conscious, Kreacher, but if he needs persuading, you can do the honors,\" said Harry. \"Thank you very much, Master,\" said Kreacher with a bow, and he retreated a short distance, his great pale eyes still fixed upon Mundungus with loathing. \"When you stripped this house of all the valuables you could find,\" Harry began again, \"you took a bunch of stuff from the kitchen cupboard. There was a locket there.\" Harry’s mouth was suddenly dry: He could sense Ron and Hermione’s tension and excitement too. \"What did you do with it?\" \"Why?\" asked Mundungus. \"Is it valuable?\" \"You’ve still got it!\" cried Hermione. \"No, he hasn’t,\" said Ron shrewdly. \"He’s wondering whether he should have asked more money for it.\" \"More?\" said Mundungus. \"That wouldn’t have been effing difficult . . .bleedin’ gave it away, di’n’ I? No choice.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"I was selling in Diagon Alley and she come up to me and asks if I’ve got a license for trading in magical artifacts. Bleedin’ snoop. She was gonna fine me, but she took a fancy to the locket an’ told me she’d take it and let me off that time, and to fink meself lucky.\" \"Who was this woman?\" asked Harry. \"I dunno, some Ministry hag.\" Mundungus considered for a moment, brow wrinkled. \"Little woman. Bow on top of ‘er head.\" He frowned and then added, \"Looked like a toad.\" Harry dropped his wand: It hit Mundungus on the nose and shot red sparks into his eyebrows, which ignited. \"Aquamenti!\" screamed Hermione, and a jet of water streamed from her wand, engulfing a spluttering and choking Mundungus. Harry looked up and saw his own shock reflected in Ron’s and Hermione’s faces. The scars on the back of his right hand seemed to be tingling again. \n",

            " THIRTYFOUR  PRIORI INCANTATEM Wormtail approached Harry, who scrambled to find his feet, to support his own weight before the ropes were untied. Wormtail raised his new silver hand, pulled out the wad of material gagging Harry, and then, with one swipe, cut through the bonds tying Harry to the gravestone. There was a split second, perhaps, when Harry might have considered running for it, but his injured leg shook under him as he stood on the overgrown grave, as the Death Eaters closed ranks, forming a tighter circle around him and Voldemort, so that the gaps where the missing Death Eaters should have stood were filled. Wormtail walked out of the circle to the place where Cedric's body lay and returned with Harry's wand, which he thrust roughly into Harry's hand without looking at him. Then Wormtail resumed his place in the circle of watching Death Eaters. \"You have been taught how to duel. Harry Potter?\" said Voldemort softly, his red eyes glinting through the darkness. At these words Harry remembered, as though from a former life, the dueling club at Hogwarts he had attended briefly two years ago. ... All he had learned there was the Disarming Spell, \"Expelliarmus\". . . and what use would it be to deprive Voldemort of his wand, even if he could, when he was surrounded by Death Eaters, outnumbered by at least thirty to one? He had never learned anything that could possibly fit him for this. He knew he was facing the thing against which Moody had always warned . . . the unblockable Avada Kedavra curse  and Voldemort was right  his mother was not here to die for him this time. ... He was quite unprotected. . . . \"We bow to each other. Harry,\" said Voldemort, bending a little, but keeping his snakelike face upturned to Harry. \"Come, the niceties must be observed. . . . Dumbledore would like you to show manners. . . . Bow to death, Harry. ...\" The Death Eaters were laughing again. Voldemorts lipless mouth was smiling. Harry did not bow. He was not going to let Voldemort play with him before killing him ... he was not going to give him that satisfaction. . . . \"I said, bow,\" Voldemort said, raising his wand  and Harry felt his spine curve as though a huge, invisible hand were bending him ruthlessly forward, and the Death Eaters laughed harder than ever. \"Very good,\" said Voldemort softly, and as he raised his wand the pressure bearing down upon Harry lifted too. \"And now you face me, like a man . . . straightbacked and proud, the way your father died. . . . \"And now  we duel.\" Voldemort raised his wand, and before Harry could do anything to defend himself, before he could even move, he had been hit again by the Cruciatus Curse. The pain was so intense, so allconsuming, that he no longer knew where he was. . . . Whitehot knives were piercing every inch of his skin, his head was surely going to burst with pain, he was screaming more loudly than he'd ever screamed in his life  And then it stopped. Harry rolled over and scrambled to his feet; he was shaking as uncontrollably as Wormtail had done when his hand had been cut off; he staggered sideways into the wall of watching Death Eaters, and they pushed him away, back toward Voldemort. \"A little break,\" said Voldemort, the slitlike nostrils dilating with excitement, \"a little pause . . . That hurt, didn't it. Harry? You don't want me to do that again, do you?\" Harry didn't answer. He was going to die like Cedric, those pitiless red eyes were telling him so ... he was going to die, and there was nothing he could do about it... but he wasn't going to play along. He wasn't going to obey Voldemort... he wasn't going to beg. . . . \"I asked you whether you want me to do that again,\" said Voldemort softly. \"Answer me! Imperial\" And Harry felt, for the third time in his life, the sensation that his mind had been wiped of all thought. . . . Ah, it was bliss, not to think, it was as though he were floating, dreaming ...just answer no ... say no ... just answer no. .. . I will not, said a stronger voice, in the back of his head, I won't answer. . . . Just answer no. . . . I won't do it, I won't say it. ... Just answer no. . . . \"I WON'T!\" And these words burst from Harry's mouth; they echoed through the graveyard, and the dream state was lifted as suddenly as though cold water had been thrown over him  back rushed the aches that the Cruciatus Curse had left all over his body  back rushed the realization of where he was, and what he was facing. . . . \"You won't?\" said Voldemort quietly, and the Death Eaters were not laughing now. \"You won't say no? Harry, obedience is a virtue I need to teach you before you die. . . . Perhaps another little dose of pain?\" Voldemort raised his wand, but this time Harry was ready; with the reflexes born of his Quidditch training, he flung himself sideways onto the ground; he rolled behind the marble headstone of Voldemort s father, and he heard it crack as the curse missed him. \"We are not playing hideandseek, Harry,\" said Voldemort's soft, cold voice, drawing nearer, as the Death Eaters laughed. \"You cannot hide from me. Does this mean you are tired of our duel? Does this mean that you would prefer me to finish it now, Harry? Come out, Harry . . . come out and play, then ... it will be quick ... it might even be painless ... I would not know... I have never died. . . .\" Harry crouched behind the headstone and knew the end had come. There was no hope ... no help to be had. And as he heard Voldemort draw nearer still, he knew one thing only, and it was beyond fear or reason: He was not going to die crouching here like a child playing hideandseek; he was not going to die kneeling at Voldemort s feet... he was going to die upright like his father, and he was going to die trying to defend himself, even if no defense was possible. . . . Before Voldemort could stick his snakelike face around the headstone. Harry stood up ... he gripped his wand tightly in his hand, thrust it out in front of him, and threw himself around the headstone, facing Voldemort. Voldemort was ready. As Harry shouted, \"Expelliarmus!\" Voldemort cried, \"Avada Kedavra!\" A jet of green light issued from Voldemorts wand just as a jet of red light blasted from Harry's  they met in midair  and suddenly Harry's wand was vibrating as though an electric charge were surging through it; his hand seized up around it; he couldn't have released it if he'd wanted to  and a narrow beam of light connected the two wands, neither red nor green, but bright, deep gold. Harry, following the beam with his astonished gaze, saw that Voldemort's long white fingers too were gripping a wand that was shaking and vibrating. And then  nothing could have prepared Harry for this  he felt his feet lift from the ground. He and Voldemort were both being raised into the air, their wands still connected by that thread of shimmering golden light. They glided away from the tombstone of Voldemort's father and then came to rest on a patch of ground that was clear and free of graves. . . . The Death Eaters were shouting; they were asking Voldemort for instructions; they were closing in, reforming the circle around Harry and Voldemort, the snake slithering at their heels, some of them drawing their wands  The golden thread connecting Harry and Voldemort splintered; though the wands remained connected, a thousand more beams arced high over Harry and Voldemort, crisscrossing all around them, until they were enclosed in a golden, domeshaped web, a cage of light, beyond which the Death Eaters circled like jackals, their cries strangely muffled now. . . . \"Do nothing!\" Voldemort shrieked to the Death Eaters, and Harry saw his red eyes wide with astonishment at what was happening, saw him fighting to break the thread of light still connecting his wand with Harry's; Harry held onto his wand more tightly, with both hands, and the golden thread remained unbroken. \"Do nothing unless I command you!\" Voldemort shouted to the Death Eaters. And then an unearthly and beautiful sound filled the air. ... It was coming from every thread of the lightspun web vibrating around Harry and Voldemort. It was a sound Harry recognized, though he had heard it only once before in his life: phoenix song. It was the sound of hope to Harry. . . the most beautiful and welcome thing he had ever heard in his life. . . . He felt as though the song were inside him instead of just around him. ... It was the sound he connected with Dumbledore, and it was almost as though a friend were speaking in his ear. . . . Don't break the connection. I know. Harry told the music, I know I mustn't. . . but no sooner had he thought it, than the thing became much harder to do. His wand began to vibrate more powerfully than ever . . . and now the beam between him and Voldemort changed too ... it was as though large beads of light were sliding up and down the thread connecting the wands  Harry felt his wand give a shudder under his hand as the light beads began to slide slowly and steadily his way. . . . The direction of the beams movement was now toward him, from Voldemort, and he felt his wand shudder angrily. . . . As the closest bead of light moved nearer to Harrys wand tip, the wood beneath his fingers grew so hot he feared it would burst into flame. The closer that bead moved, the harder Harry's wand vibrated; he was sure his wand would not survive contact with it; it felt as though it was about to shatter under his fingers  He concentrated every last particle of his mind upon forcing the bead back toward Voldemort, his ears full of phoenix song, his eyes furious, fixed . . . and slowly, very slowly, the beads quivered to a halt, and then, just as slowly, they began to move the other way . . . and it was Voldemort's wand that was vibrating extrahard now . . . Voldemort who looked astonished, and almost fearful. . . . One of the beads of light was quivering, inches from the tip of Voldemorts wand. Harry didn't understand why he was doing it, didn't know what it might achieve . . . but he now concentrated as he had never done in his life on forcing that bead of light right back into Voldemort s wand . . . and slowly . . . very slowly ... it moved along the golden thread ... it trembled for a moment. . . and then it connected. . . . At once, Voldemorts wand began to emit echoing screams of pain . . . then  Voldemort's red eyes widened with shock  a dense, smoky hand flew out of the tip of it and vanished . . . the ghost of the hand he had made Wormtail. . . more shouts of pain . . . and then something much larger began to blossom from Voldemorts wand tip, a great, grayish something, that looked as though it were made of the solidest, densest smoke. ... It was a head . . . now a chest and arms . . . the torso of Cedric Diggory. If ever Harry might have released his wand from shock, it would have been then, but instinct kept him clutching his wand tightly, so that the thread of golden light remained unbroken, even though the thick gray ghost of Cedric Diggory (was it a ghost? it looked so solid) emerged in its entirety from the end of Voldemort s wand, as though it were squeezing itself out of a very narrow tunnel. . . and this shade of Cedric stood up, and looked up and down the golden thread of light, and spoke. \"Hold on. Harry,\" it said. Its voice was distant and echoing. Harry looked at Voldemort ... his wide red eyes were still shocked ... he had no more expected this than Harry had . . . and, very dimly. Harry heard the frightened yells of the Death Eaters, prowling around the edges of the golden dome. . More screams of pain from the wand . . . and then something else emerged from its tip ... the dense shadow of a second head, quickly followed by arms and torso ... an old man Harry had seen only in a dream was now pushing himself out of the end of the wand just as Cedric had done . . . and his ghost, or his shadow, or whatever it was, fell next to Cedric's, and surveyed Harry and Voldemort, and the golden web, and the connected wands, with mild surprise, leaning on his walking stick. . . . \"He was a real wizard, then?\" the old man said, his eyes on Voldemort. \"Killed me, that one did. . . . You fight him, boy. . . .\" But already, yet another head was emerging ... and this head, gray as a smoky statue, was a woman's. . . . Harry, both arms shaking now as he fought to keep his wand still, saw her drop to the ground and straighten up like the others, staring. . . . The shadow of Bertha Jorkins surveyed the battle before her with wide eyes. \"Don't let go, now!\" she cried, and her voice echoed like Cedrics as though from very far away. \"Don't let him get you, Harry  don't let go!\" She and the other two shadowy figures began to pace around the inner walls of the golden web, while the Death Eaters flitted around the outside of it... and Voldemort's dead victims whispered as they circled the duelers, whispered words of encouragement to Harry, and hissed words Harry couldn't hear to Voldemort. And now another head was emerging from the tip of Voldemorts wand . . . and Harry knew when he saw it who it would be ... he knew, as though he had expected it from the moment when Cedric had appeared from the wand . . . knew, because the man appearing was the one he'd thought of more than any other tonight. . . . The smoky shadow of a tall man with untidy hair fell to the ground as Bertha had done, straightened up, and looked at him . . . and Harry, his arms shaking madly now, looked back into the ghostly face of his father. \"Your mother's coming . . .\" he said quietly. \"She wants to see you ... it will be all right.. . hold on. . . .\" And she came. . . first her head, then her body... a young woman with long hair, the smoky, shadowy form of Lily Potter blossomed from the end of Voldemort's wand, fell to the ground, and straightened like her husband. She walked close to Harry, looking down at him, and she spoke in the same distant, echoing voice as the others, but quietly, so that Voldemort, his face now livid with fear as his victims prowled around him, could not hear. . .. \"When the connection is broken, we will linger for only moments . . . but we will give you time. . . you must get to the Portkey, it will return you to Hogwarts ... do you understand, Harry?\" \"Yes,\" Harry gasped, fighting now to keep a hold on his wand, which was slipping and sliding beneath his fingers. \"Harry . . .\" whispered the figure of Cedric, \"take my body back, will you? Take my body back to my parents, ...\" \"I will,\" said Harry, his face screwed up with the effort of holding the wand. \"Do it now,\" whispered his father's voice, \"be ready to run . . . do it now. ...\" \"NOW!\" Harry yelled; he didn't think he could have held on for another moment anyway  he pulled his wand upward with an almighty wrench, and the golden thread broke; the cage of light vanished, the phoenix song died  but the shadowy figures of Voldemort's victims did not disappear  they were closing in upon Voldemort, shielding Harry from his gaze  And Harry ran as he had never run in his life, knocking two stunned Death Eaters aside as he passed; he zigzagged behind headstones, feeling their curses following him, hearing them hit the headstones  he was dodging curses and graves, pelting toward Cedric's body, no longer aware of the pain in his leg, his whole being concentrated on what he had to do  \"Stun him!\" he heard Voldemort scream. Ten feet from Cedric, Harry dived behind a marble angel to avoid the jets of red light and saw the tip of its wing shatter as the spells hit it. Gripping his wand more tightly, he dashed out from behind the angel  \"Impedimenta!\" he bellowed, pointing his wand wildly over his shoulder at the Death Eaters running at him. From a muffled yell, he thought he had stopped at least one of them, but there was no time to stop and look; he jumped over the cup and dived as he heard more wand blasts behind him; more jets of light flew over his head as he fell, stretching out his hand to grab Cedric's arm... \"Stand aside! I will kill him! He is mine!\" shrieked Voldemort. Harry's hand had closed on Cedric's wrist; one tombstone stood between him and Voldemort, but Cedric was too heavy to carry, and the cup was out of reach  Voldemort's red eyes flamed in the darkness. Harry saw his mouth curl into a smile, saw him raise his wand. \"Accio!\" Harry yelled, pointing his wand at the Triwizard Cup. It flew into the air and soared toward him. Harry caught it by the handle  He heard Voldemort s scream of fury at the same moment that he felt the jerk behind his navel that meant the Portkey had worked  it was speeding him away in a whirl of wind and color, and Cedric along with him. . . . They were going back. \n",

            "-Six The Flaw in the Plan He was flying facedown on the grond again. The smell of the forest filled his nostrils. He could feel the cold hard ground beneath his cheek, and the hinge of his glasses which have been knocked sideways by the fall cutting into his temple. Every inch of him ached, and the place where Killing Curse had hit him felt like the bruise of an iron-clad punch. He did not stir, but he remained exactly where he had fallen, with his left arm bent out at an akward angle and his mouth gaping. He had expected to hear cheer of triumph and jubilation at his death, but instead hurried footsteps, whispers, and solicitous murmurs filled the air. \"My Lord... my Lord...\" It was Bellatrix's voice, and she spoke as if to a lover. Harry did not dare open his eyes, but allowed his other senses to explore his predicament. He knew that his wand was still stowed beneath his robes because he could feel it pressed between his chest and the ground. A slight cushioning effect in the area of his stomach told him that the Invisibility Cloak was also there, stuffed out of sight. \"My Lord...\" \"That will do,\" said Voldemort's voice. More footsteps. Several people were backing away from the same spot. Desperate to see what was happening and why, Harry opened his eyes by a milimeter. Voldemort seemed to be getting to his feet. Various Death Eaters were hurrying away from him, returning to the crowd lining the clearing. Bellatrix alone remained behind, kneeling beside Voldemort. Harry closed his eyes again and considered what he had seen. The Death Eaters have been buddled around Voldemort, who seem to have fallen to the ground. Something had happened when he had hit Harry with the Killing Curse. Had Voldemort too collapsed? It seemed like it. And both of them had briefly fallen unconcious and both of them had now returned. . . \"My Lord, let me --\" \"I do not require assitance,\" said Voldemort coldly, and though he could not see it, Harry pictured Bellatrix withdrawing a helpful hand. \"The boy . . . Is he dead?\" There was a complete silence in the clearing. Nobody approached Harry, but he felt their concentraded gaze; it seemed to press him harder into the ground, and he was terrified a finger or an eyelid might twitch. \"You,\" said Voldemort, and there was a bang and a small shrick of pain. \"Examine him. Tell me whether he is dead.\" Harry did not know who had been sent to verify. He could only lie there, with his heart thumping traitorously, and wait to be examined, but at the same time nothing, small comfort through it was, that Voldemort was wary of approaching him, that Voldemort suspected that all had not gone to plan . . . . Hands, softer than he had been expecting, touched Harry's face, and felt his heart. He could hear the woman's fast breathing, her pounding of life against his ribs. \"Is Draco alive? Is he in the castle?\" The whisper was barely audible, her lips were an inch from his car, her head bent so low that her long hair shielded his face from the onlookers. \"Yes,\" he breathed back. He felt the hand on his chest contract: her nails pierced him. Then it was withdrawn. She had sat up. \"He is dead!\" Narcissa Malfoy called to the watchers. And now they shouted, now they yelled in triumph and stamped their feet, and through his eyelids, Harry saw bursts of red and silver light shoot into the air in celebration. Still feigning death on the ground, he understood. Narcissa knew that the only way she would be permitted to enter Hogwarts, and find her son, was as part of the conquering army. She no longer cared whether Voldemort won. \"You see?\" screeched Voldemort over the tumult. \"Harry Potter is dead by my hand, and no man alive can threaten me now! Watch! Crucio!\" Harry had been expecting it, knew his body would not be allowed to remain unsullied upon the forest floor; it must be subjected to humiliation to prove Voldemort's victory. He was lifted into the air, and it took all his determination to remain limp, yet the pain he expected did not come. He was thrown once, twice, three times into the air. His glasses flew off and he felt his wand slide a little beneath his robes, but he kept himself floppy and lifeless, and when he fell no ground for the last time, the clearing echoed with jeers and shrieks of laughter. \"Now,\" said Voldemort, \"we go to the castle, and show them what has become of their hero. Who shall drag the body? No - Wait - \" There was a fresh outbreak of laughter, and after a few moments Harry felt the ground trembling beneath him. \"You carry him,\" Voldemort said. \"He will be nice and visible in your arms, will he not? Pick up your little friend, Hagrid. And the glasses - put on the glasses - he must be recognizable - \" Someone slammed Harry's glasses back onto his face with deliberate force, but the enormous hands that lifted him into the air were exceedingly gentle. Harry could feel Hagrid's arms trembling with the force of his heaving sobs; great tears splashed down upon him as Hagrid cradled Harry in his arms, and Harry did not dare, by movement or word, to intimate to Hagrid that all was not, yet, lost. \"Move,\" said Voldemort, and Hagrid stumbled forward, forcing his way through the close-growing trees, back through the forest. Branches caught at Harry's hair and robes, but he lay quiescent, his mouth lolling open, his eyes shut, and in the darkness, while the Death Eaters croed all around them, and while Hagrid sobbed blindly, nobody looked to see whether a pulse beat in the exposed neck of Harry Potter. . . . The two giants crashed along behind the Death Eaters; Harry could hear trees creaking and falling as they passed; they made so much din that birds toes shrieking into the sky, and even the jeers of the Death Eaters were drowned. The victorious procession marched on toward the open ground, and after a while Harry could tell, by the lightening of the darkness through his closed eyelids, that the trees were beginning to thin. \"BANE!\" Hagrid's unexpected bellow nearly forced Harry's eyes open. \"Happy now, are yeh, that yeh didn't fight, yeh cowardly bunch o' nags? Are yeh happy Harry Potter's - d-dead . . . ?\" Hagrid could not continue, but broke down in fresh tears. Harry wondered how many centaurs were watching their procession pass; he dared not open his eyes to look. Some of the Death Eaters called insults at the centaurs as they left them behind. A little later, Harry sensed, by a freshening of the air, that they had reached the edge of the forest. \"Stop.\" Harry thought that Hagrid must have been forced to obey Voldemort's command, because he lurched a little. And now a chill settled over them where they sood, and Harry heard the rasping breath of the dementors that patrolled the other trees. They would not affect him now. The fact of his own survival burned inside him, a talisman against them, as though his father's stag kept guardian in his heart. Someone passed close by Harry, and he knew that it was Voldemort himself because he spoke a moment later, his voice magically magnified so that it swelled through the ground, crashing upon Harry's eardrums. \"Harry Potter is dead. He was killed as he ran away, trying to save himself while you lay down your lives for him. We bring you his body as proof that your hero is gone. \"The battle is won. You have lost half of your fighters. My Death Eaters outnumber you, and the Boy Who Lived is finished. There must be no more war. Anyone who continues to resist, man, woman or child, will be slaughtered, as will every member of their family. Come out of the castle now, kneel before me, and you shall be spared. Your parents and children, your brothers and sisters will live and be forgiven, and you will join me in the new world we shall build togheter.\" There was silence in the grounds and from the castle. Voldemort was so close to him that Harry did not dare open his eyes again. \"Come,\" said Voldemort, and Harry heard him move ahead, and Hagrid was forced to follow. Now Harry opened his eyes a fraction, and saw Voldemort striding in front them, wearing the great snake Nagini around his shoulders, now free of her enchanted cage. But Harry had no possibility of extracting the wand concealed under his robes without being noticed by the Death Eaters, who marched on the either side of them through the slowly lightening darkness . . . . \"Harry,\" sobbed Hagrid. \"Oh, Harry . . . Harry . . .\" Harry shut his eyes tight again. He knew that they were approaching the castle and strained his ears to distinguish, above the gleeful voices of the Death Eaters and their tramping footsteps, signs of life from those within. \"Stop.\" The Death Eaters camte to a halt; Harry heard them spreading out in a line facing the opne front doors of the school. He could see, even though his closed lids, the teddish glow that meant light streamed upon him from the entrance hall. He waited. Any moment, the people for whom he had tried to die would see him, lying apparently dead, in Hagrid's arms. \"NO!\" The scream was the more terrible because he had never expected or dreamed that Professor McGonagall could make such a sound. He heard another women laughing nearby, and knew that Bellatrix gloried in McGonagall's despair. He squinted again for a single second and saw the open doorway filling with people, as the survivors of the battle came out onto the front steps to face their vanquishers and see the truth of Harry's death for themselves. He saw Voldemort standing a little in front of him, stroking Nagini's head with a single white finger. He closed his eyes again. \"No!\" \"No!\" \"Harry! HARRY!\" Ron's, Hermione's, and Ginny's voices were worse than McGonagall's; Harry wanted nothing more than to call back, yet he made himself lie silent, and their cries acted like a trigger; the crowd of survivors took up the cause, screaming and yelling abuse at the Death Eathers, until - \"SILENCE!\" cried Voldemort, and there was a bang and a flash of bright light, and silence was forced upn them all. \"It is over! Set him down, Hagrid, at my feet, where he belongs!\" Harry felt himself lowered onto the grass. \"You see? said Voldemort, and Harry felt him striding backward and forward right beside the place where he lay. \"Harry Potter is dead! Do you understand now, deluded ones? He was nothing, ever, but a boy who relied on others to sacrifice themselves for him!\" \"He beat you!\" yelled Ron, and the charm broke, and the defenders of Hogwarts were shouting and screaming again until a second, more powerful bang extinguished their voices once more. \"He was killed while trying to sneak out of the castle grounds,\" said Voldemort, and there was a relish in his voice for the lie. \"killed while trying to save himself - \" But Voldemort broke off: Harry heard a scuffle and a shout, then another bang, a flash of light, and grunt of pain; he opened his eyes an infinitesimal amount. Someone had broken free of the crowd and charged at Voldemort: Harry saw the figure hit the ground. Disarmed, Voldemort throwing the challenger's wand aside and laughing. \"And who is this?\" he said in his soft snake's hiss. \"Who has volunteered to demonstrate what happens to those who continue to fight when the battle is lost?\" Bellatrix gave a delighted laugh. \"It is Neville Longbottom, my Lord! The boy who has been giving the Carrows so much trouble! The son of the Aurors, remember?\" \"Ah, yes, I remember,\" said Voldemort, looking down at Neville, who was struggling back to his feet, unarmed and unproctected, standing in the no-man's-land between the survivors and the Death Eaters. \"But you are a pureblood, aren't you, my brave boy? Voldemort asked Neville, who stood facing him, his empty hands curled in fists. \"So what if I am?\" said Neville loudly. \"You show spirit and bravery, and you come of noble stock. You will make a very valuable Death Eater. We need your kind, Neville Longbottom.\" \"I'll join you when hell freezes over,\" said Neville. \"Dumbledore's Army!\" he shouted, and there was an answering cheer from the crowd, whom Voldemort's Silencing Charms seemed unable to hold. \"Very well,\" said Voldemort, and Harry heard more danger in the silkiness of his voice than in the most powerful curse. \"If that is your choice, Longbottom, we revert to the original plan. On your head,\" he said quietly, \"be it.\" Still watching through his lashes, Harry saw Voldemort wave his wand. Seconds later, out of one of the castle's shattered windows, something that looked like a misshapen bird flew through the half light and landed in Voldemort's hand. He shook the mildewed object by its pointed end and it dangled, emtpy and ragged: the Sorting Hat. \"There will be no more Sorting at Hogwarts School,\" said Voldemort. \"There will be no more Houses. The emblem, sheild and colors of my noble ancestor, Salazar Slythering, will suffice everyone. Won't they, Neville Longbottom?\" He pointed his wand at Neville, who grew rigid and still, then forced the hat onto Neville's head, so thta it slipped down below his eyes. There were movements from the watching crowd in front of the castle, and as one, the Death Eaters raised their wands, holding the fighters of Hogwarts at bay. \"Neville here is now going to demonstrate what happens to anyone foolish enough to continue to oppose me,\" said Voldemort, and with a flick of his wand, he caused the Sorting Hat to burst into flames. Screams split the dawn, and Neville was a flame, rooted to the spot, unable to move, and Harry could not bear it: He must act - And then many things happened at the same moment. They heard uproar from the distant boundary of the school as what sounded like hundreds of people came swarming over the out-of-sight walls and pelted toward the castle, uttering lowd war cries. At the same time, Grawp came lumbering around the side of the castel and yelled, \"HAGGER!\" His cry was answered by roars from Voldemort's giants: They ran at Grawp like bull elephants making the earth quake. Then came hooves and the twangs of bows, and arrows were suddenly falling amongst the Death Eaters, who broke ranks, shouting their surprise. Harry pulled the Invisibilty Cloak from inside his robes, swunt it over himself, and sprang to his feet, as Neville moved too. In one swift, fluid motin, Neville broke free of the Body-Bind Curse upon him; the flaming har fell off him and he drew from its depths something silver, with a glittering, rubied handle - The slash of the silver blade could not be heard over the roar of the oncoming crowd or the sounds of the clashing giants or of te stampending centaurs, and yet, it seemd to draw every eye. With a single stroke Neville sliced off the great snake's head, which spun high into the air, gleaming in the light flooding from the entrance hall, and Voldemort's mouth was open in a scream of fury that nobody could hear, and the snake's body thudded to the ground at his feet- Hidden beneath the Invisibilty Cloak, Harry cast a Shield Charm between Neville and Voldemort before the latter could raise his stamps of the battling giants, Hagrid's yell came loudets of all. \"HARRY!\" Hagrid shouted. \"HARRY - WHERE'S HARRY?\" Chaos reigned. The charging centaurs were scattering the Death Eaters, everyone was feeling the giants' stamping feet, and nearer and nearar thundered the reinforcements that had come from who knew where; Harry saw great winget creatues soaring the heads of Voldemort's giants, thestrals and Buckbeak the hippogriff scratching at their eyes while Grawp punched and pummeled them and now the wizards, defenders of Hogwarts and Death Eaters alike were being forced back into the castle. Harry was shooting jinxes and curses at any Death Eater he could see, and they crumpled, not knowing what or who had hit them, and their bodies were trampled by the retreating crowd. Still hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, Harry was buffered into the entrance hall: He was searching for Voldemort and saw him across the room, firing spells from his wand as he backed into the Great Hall, still screaming instructions to his followers as he sent curses flying left and right; Harry cast more Shield Charms, and Voldemort's would-be victims. Seamus Finnigan and Hannah Abbott, datted past him into the Great Hall, where they joined the fight already flourishing inside it. And now there were more, even more people storming up the front steps, and Harry saw Charlie Weasly overtaking Horace Slughorn, who was still wearing his emeral pijamas. They seemed to have returned at the head of what looked like the families and friends of every Hogwarts student who had remained to fight along with the shopkeeps and homeowners of Hogsmeade. The centaurs Bane, Ronan and Magorian burst into the hall with a great clatter of hooves, as behind Harry the door that led to the kitchens was blasted off its hinges. The house-elves of Hogwarts swarmed intot he entrance hall, screaming and waving carving knives and cleaver, and at their head, the locker of Regulus Black bouncing on his chest, was Kreacher, his bullfrog's voice audible even above this din: \"Fight! Fight! Fight for my Master, defender of house-elves! Fight the Dark Lord, in the name of brave Regulus! Fight!\" They were hacking and stabbing at the ankles and shim of Death Eaters their tiny faces alive with malice, and everywhere Harry looked Death Eaters were folding under sheer weight of numbers, overcome by spells, dragging arrows from wounds, stabbed in the leg by elves, or else simply attempting to escape, but swallowed by the oncoming horde. But it was not over yet: Harry sped between duelers, past atruggling prosoners, and into he Great Hall. Voldemort was in the center of the battle, and he was striking and smiting al within reach. Harry could not get a clear shot, but fought his way nearer, still invisible, and the Great Hall became more and more crowded as everyone who could walk forced their way inside. Harry saw Yaxley slammed tot he floor by George and Lee Jordan, saw Dolohov fall with a scream at Flitwick's hands, saw Walden Macnair thrown across the room by Hagrid, hit the stone wall opposite, and slide unconscious to the ground. He saw Ron and Neville bringing down Fenrir Greyback. Aberforth Stunning Rookwood, Arthur and Percy flooting Thicknesse, and Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy running through the crowd, not even attempting to fight, screaming for their son. Voldemort was now dueling McGonagall, Slughorn, Kingsley all at once, and there was a cold hatred in his face as they wove and ducked around him, unable to finish him - Bellatrix was still fighing too, fifty yards away from Voldemort, and like her master she dueled three at once: Hermione, Ginny and Luna, all battling their hardest, but Bellatrix was equal to them, and Harry's attention was diverted as a Killing Curse shot so close to Ginny that she missed death by an inch - He changed course, running at Bellatrix rather than Voldemort, but before he had gone a few steps he was knocked sideways. \"NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!\" Mrs. Weasley threw off her cloak as she ran, freeing her arms, Bellatrix spun on the spot, roaring with laughter at the sight of the new challenger. \"OUT OF MY WAY!\" shouted Mrs. Weasley to the three girls, and with a simple swipe of her wand she began to duel. Harry watched with terror and elation as Molly Weasley's wand slashed and twisted, and Bellatrix Lestrange's smile faltered and became a snarl. Jets of light flew from both wands, the floor around the withces' feet became bot and cracked; both woman were fighting to kill. \"No!\" Mrs. Weasley cried as a few students ran forward, trying to come to her aid. \"Get back! Get back! She is mine!\" Hundreds of people now lined the walls, watching the two fights, Voldemort and his three opponents, Bellatrix and Molly, and Harry stood, invisible, torn between both, wanting to attack and yet to protect, unable to be sure that he would not hit the innocent. \"What will happen to your children when I've killed you?\" taunted Bellatrix, as mad as her master, capering as Molly's curses danced around her. \"When Mummy's gone the same way as Freddie?\" \"You - will - never - touch - our - children - again!\" screamed Mrs. Weasley. Bellatrix laughed the same exhilarated laugh her cousin Sirius had given as he toppled backward through the veil, and suddenly Harry knew what was going to happen before it did. Molly's curse soared beneath Bellatrix's constreched arm and hit her squarely in the chest, directly over her heart. Bellatrix's glounting smile froze, her eyes seemd to bulge: For the tiniest space of time she knew what had happened, and then she toppled, and the watching crowd roared, and Voldemord screamed. Harry felt as though he turned into slow motin: he saw McGonagall, Kingsley and Slughorn blasted backward, flailing and writhing through the air, as Voldemort's fury at the fall of his last, best leutenant exploded with the force of a bomb, Voldemort raised his wand and directed it at Molly Weasley. \"Protego!\" roared Harry, and the Shield Charm expanded in the middle of the Hall, and Voldemort stared around for the source as Harry pulled off the Invisibility Cloak at last. The yell of shock, the cheers, the screams on every side of :\"Harry!\" \"HE'S ALIVE!\" were stifled at once. The crowd was afraid, and silence fell abruptly and completely as Voldemort and Harry looked at each other, and began, at the same moment, to circle each other. \"I don't want anyone else to help,\" Harry said loudly, and in the total silence his voice carried like a trumpet call. \"It's got to be like this. It's got to be me.\" Voldemort hissed. \"Potter doesn't mean that,\" he said, his red eyes wide. \"This isn't how he works, is it? Who are you going to use as a shield today, Potter?\" \"Nobody,\" said Harry simply. \"There are no more Horcruxes. It's just you and me. Neither can live while the other survives, and one of us is about to leave for good. . . .\" \"One of us?\" jeered Voldemort, and his wholy body was taut and his red eyes stared, a snake that was about to strike. \"You think it will be you, do you, the boy who has survived by accident, and because Dumbledore was pulling the strings?\" \"Accident, was it, when my mother died to save me?\" asked Harry. They were still moving sideways, both of them, in that perfect circle, maintaining the same distance from each other, and for Harry no face existed but Voldemort's. \"Accident, when I decided to fight in that graveyard? Accident, that I didn't defend myself tonight, and still survived, and returned to fight again?\" \"Accidents!\" screamed Voldemort, but still he did not strike, and the watching crowd was frozen as if Petrified, and of the hundreds in the Hall, nobody seemed to breathe but they two. \"Accident and chance and the fact that you crouched and sniveled behind the skirts of greater men and women, and permitted me to kill them for you!\" \"You won't be killing anyone else tonight,\" said Harry as they circled, and stared into each other's eyes, green into red. \"You won't be able to kill any of them ever again. Don't you get it? I was ready to die to stop you from hurting these people - \" \"But you did not!\" \" - I meant to, and that's what did it. I've done what my mother did. They're protected from you. Haven't you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding? You can't torture them. You can't touch them. You don't learn from your mistakes, Riddle, do you?\" \"You dare -\" \"Yes, I dare,\" said Harry. \"I know things you don't know, Tom Riddle. I know lots of important things that you don't. Want to hear some, before you make another big mistake?\" Voldemort did not speak, but powled in a circle, and Harry knew that he kept him temporarily mesmerized at bay, held back by the faintest possibility that Harry might indeed know a final secret. . . . \"Is it love again?\" said Voldemort, his snake's face jeering. \"Dumbledore favorite solution, love, which he claimed conqered death, though love did not stop him falling from the tower and breaking like and old waxwork? Love, which did not prevent me stamping out your Modblood mother like a cockroack, Potter - and nobody seems to love you enough to run forward this time and take my curse. So what will stop you dying now when I strike?\" \"Just one thing,\" said Harry, and still they circled each other, wrapped in each other, held apart by nothing but the last secret. \"If it is not love that will save you this time,\" said Voldemort, \"you must believe that you have magic that i do not, or else a weapon more powerful than mine?\" \"I believe both,\" said Harry, and he saw shock flit across the snakelike face, though it was instantly dispelled; Voldemort began to laugh, and the sound was more frightening than his screams; humorles and insane, it echoed around the silent Hall. \"You think you know more magic than I do?\" he said. \"Than I, than Lord Voldemort, who has performed magic that Dumbledore himself never dreamed of?\" \"Oh he dreamed of it,\" said Harry, \"but he knew more than you, knew enough not to do what you've done.\" \"You mean he was weak!\" screamed Voldemort. \"Too weak to dare, too weak to take what might have been his, what will be mine!\" \"No, he was cleverer than you,\" said Harry, \"a better wizard, a better man.\" \"I brought about the death of Albus Dumbledore!\" \"You thought you did,\" said Harry, \"but you were wrong.\" For the frist time, the watching crowd stirred as the hundreds of people around the walls drew breath as one. \"Dumbledore is dead!\" Voldemort hurled the words at Harry as in the marble tomb in the grounds of this castle, I have seen it, Potter, and he will not return!\" \"Yes, Dumbledore is dead,\" said Harry calmly, \"but you didn't have him killed. He chose his own manner of dying, chose it months before he died, arranged the whole thing with the man you thought was your servant.\" \"What chldish dream is this?\" said Voldemort, but still he did not strike, and his red eyes did not waver from Harry's. \"Severus Snape wasn't yours,\" said Harry. \"Snape was Dumbledore's. Dumbledore's from the moment you starting hunting down my mother. And you never realized it, because of the thing you can't understand. You never saw Snape cast a Patronus, did you, Riddle?\" Voldemort did not answer. They continued to circle each other like wolves about to tear each other apart. \"Snape's Patronus was a doe,\" said Harry, \"the same as my mother's, because he loved her for nearly all of his life, from the time when they were children. You should have realized,\" he said as he saw Voldemort's nostrils flare, \"he asked you to spare her life, didn't he?\" \"He desired her, that was all,\" sneered Voldemort, \"but when she had gone, he agreed that there were other women, and of purer blood, worhier of him - \" \"Of course he told you that,\" said Harry, \"but he was Dumbledore's spy from the moment you threatened her, and he's been working against you ever since! Dumbledore was already dying when Snape finished him!\" \"It matters not!\" shrieked Voldemort, who had followed every word with rapt attention, but now let out a cackle of mad laughter. \"It matters not whether Snape was mine or Dumbledore's, or what petty obstacles they tried to put in my path! I crushed them as I crushed your mother, Snape's supposed great love! Oh, but it all makes sense, Potter, and in ways that you do not understand! \"Dumbledore was trying to keep the Elder Wand from me! He intended that Snape should be the true master of the wand! But I got there ahead of you, little boy - I reached the wand before you could get your hands on it, I understood the truth before you caught up. I killed Severus Snape three hours ago, and the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny is truly mine! Dumbledore's last plan went wrong, Harry Potter!\" \"Yeah, it did.\" said Harry. \"You're right. But before you try to kill me, I'd advise you think what you've done . . . . Think, and try for some remorse, Riddle. . . .\" \"What is this?\" Of all the things that Harry had said to him, beyond any revelation or taunt, nothing had socked Voldemort like this. Harry saw is pupils contract to thin slits, saw the skin around his eyes whiten. \"It's your one last chance,\" said Harry, \"it's all you've got left. . . . I've seen what you'll be otherwise. . . . Be a man. . . try. . . Try for some remorse. . . .\" \"You dare --- ?\" said Voldemort again. \"Yes, I dare,\" said Harry, \"because Dumbledore’s last plan hasn’t backfired on me at all. It’s backfired on you, Riddle.\" Voldemort’s hand was trembling on the Elder Wand, and Harry gripped Draco’s very tightly. The moment, he knew, was seconds away. \"That wand still isn’t working properly for you because you murdered the wrong person. Severus Snape was never the true master of the Elder Wand. He never defeated Dumbledore.\" \"He killed --- \" \"Aren’t you listening? Snape never beat Dumbledore! Dumbledore’s death was planned between them! Dumbledore instended to die, undefeated, the wand’s last true master! If all had gone as planned, the wand’s power would have died with him, because it had never been won from him!\" \"But then, Potter, Dumbledore as good as gave me the wand!\" Voldemort’s voice shook with malicious pleasure. \"I stole the wand from its last master’s tomb! I removed it against the last master’s wishes! Its power is mine!\" \"You still don’t get it, Riddle, do you? Possessing the wand isn’t enough! Holding it, using it, doesn’t make it really yours. Didn’t you listen to Ollivander? The wand chooses the wizard . . . The Elder Wand recognized a new master before Dumbledore died, someone who never even laid a hand on it. The new master removed the wand from Dumbledore against his will, never realizing exactly what he had done, or that the world’s most dangerous wand had given him its allegiance . . .\" Voldemort’s chest rose and fell rapidly, and Harry could feel the curse coming, feel it building inside the wand pointed at his face. \"The true master of the Elder Wand was Draco Malfoy.\" Blank shock showed in Voldemort’s face for a moment, but then it was gone. \"But what does it matter?\" he said softly. \"Even if you are right, Potter, it makes no difference to you and me. You no longer have the phoenix wand: We duel on skill alone . . . and after I have killed you, I can attend to Draco Malfoy . . .\" \"But you’re too late,\" said Harry. \"You’ve missed your chance. I got there first. I overpowered Draco weeks ago. I took his wand from him.\" Harry twitched the hawthorn wand, and he felt the eyes of everyone in the Hall upon it. \"So it all comes down to this, doesn’t it?\" whispered Harry. \"Does the wand in your hand know its last master was Disarmed? Because if it does . . . I am the true master of the Elder Wand.\" A red-glow burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above them as an edge of dazzling sun appeared over the sill of the nearest window. The light hit both of their faces at the same time, so that Voldemort’s was suddenly a flaming blur. Harry heard the high voice shriek as he too yelled his best hope to the heavens, pointing Draco’s wand: \"Avada Kedavra!\" \"Expelliarmus!\" The bang was like a cannon blast, and the golden flames that erupted between them, at the dead center of the circle they had been treading, marked the point where the spells collided. Harry saw Voldemort’s green jet meet his own spell, saw the Elder Wand fly high, dark against the sunrise, spinning across the enchanted ceiling like the head of Nagini, spinning through the air toward the master it would not kill, who had come to take full possession of it at last. And Harry, with the unerring skill of the Seeker, caught the wand in his free hand as Voldemort fell backward, arms splayed, the slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upward. Tom Riddle hit the floor with a mundane finality, his body feeble and shrunken, the white hands empty, the snakelike face vacant and unknowing. Voldemort was dead, killed by his own rebounding curse, and Harry stood with two wands in his hand, staring down at his enemy’s shell. One shivering second of silence, the shock of the moment suspended: and then the tumult broke around Harry as the screams and the cheers and the roars of the watchers rent the air. The fierce new sun dazzled the windows as they thundered toward him, and the first to reach him were Ron and Hermione, and it was their arms that were wrapped around him, their incomprehensible shouts that deafened him. The Ginny, Neville, and Luna were there, and then all the Weasleys and Hagrid, and Kingsley and McGonagall and Flitwick and Sprout, and Harry could not hear a word that anyone was shouting, not tell whose hands were seizing him, pulling him, trying to hug some part of him, hundreds of them pressing in, all of them determined to touch the Boy Who Lived, the reason it was over at last --- The sun rose steadily over Hogwarts, and the Great Hall blazed with life and light. Harry was an indispensible part of the mingled outpourings of jubilation and mourning, of grief and celebration. They wanted him there with them, their leader and symbol, their savior and their guide, and that he had not slept, that he craved the company of only a few of them, seemed to occur to no one. He must speak to the bereaved, clasp their hands, witness their tears, receive their thanks, hear the news now creeping in from every quarter as the morning drew on; that the Imperiused up and down the country had come back to themselves, that Death Eaters were fleeing or else being captured, that the innocent of Azkaban were being released at that very moment, and that Kingsley Shacklebolt had been named temporary Minister of Magic. They moved Voldemort’s body and laid it in a chamber off the Hall, away form the bodies of Fred, Tonks, Lupin, Colin Creevey, and fifty others who had died fighting him. McGonagall had replaced the House tables, not nobody was sitting according to House anymore: All were jumbled together, teachers and pupils, ghosts and parents, centaurs and house-elves, and Firenze lay recovering in the corner, and Grawp peered in through a smashed window, and people were throwing food into his laughing mouth. After a while, exhausted and drained, Harry found himself sitting on a bench beside Luna. \"I’d want some peace and quiet, if it were me,\" she said. \"I’d love some,\" he replied. \"I’ll distract them all,\" she said. \"Use your cloak.\" And before he could say a word, she had cried, \"Oooh, look, a Blibbering Humdinger!\" and pointed out the window. Everyone who heard looked around, and Harry slid the Cloak up over himself, and got to his feet. Now he could move through the Hall without interference. He spotted Ginny two tables away; she was sitting with her head on her mother’s shoulder: There would be time to talk later, hours and days and maybe years in which to talk. He saw Neville, the sword of Gryffindor lying beside his plate as he ate, surrounded by a knot of fervent admirers. Along the aisle between the tables he walked, and he spotted the three Malfoys, huddled together as though unsure whether or not they were supposed to be there, but nobody was paying them any attention. Everywhere he looked, he saw families reunited, and finally, he saw the two whose company he craved most. \"It’s me,\" he muttered, crouching down between them. \"Will you come with me?\" They stood up at once, and together he, Ron and Hermione left the Great Hall. Great chunks were missing from the marble staircase, part of the balustrade gone, and rubble and bloodstains occurred ever few steps as their climbed. Somewhere in the distance they could hear Peeves zooming through the corridors singing a victory song of his own composition: We did it, we bashed them, wee Potter’s the one, And Voldy’s gone moldy, so now let’s have fun! \"Really gives a feeling for the scope and tragedy of the thing, doesn’t it?\" said Ron, pushing open a door to let Harry and Hermione through. Happiness would come, Harry though, but at the moment it was muffled by exhaustion, and the pain of losing Fred and Lupin and Tonks pierced him like a physical wound every few steps. Most of all he felt the most stupendous relief, and a longing to sleep. But first he owed an explanation to Ron and Hermione, who had stuck with him for so long, and who deserved the truth. Painstakingly he recounted what he had seem in the Pensieve and what had happened in the forest, and they had not even begun to express all their shock and amazement, when at last they arrived at the place to which they had been walking, though none of them had mentioned their destination. Since he had last seen it, the gargoyle guarding the entrance to the headmaster’s study had been knocked aside; it stood lopsided, looking a little punch-drunk, and Harry wondered whether it would be able to distinguish passwords anymore. \"Can we go up?\" he asked the gargoyle. \"Feel free,\" groaned the statue. They clambered over him and onto the spiral stone staircase that moved slowly upward like an escalator. Harry pushed open the door at the top. He had one, brief glimpse of the stone Pensieve on the desk where he had left it, and then an earsplitting noise made him cry out, thinking of curses and returning Death Eaters and the rebirth of Voldemort --- But it was applause. All around the walls, the headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts were giving him a standing ovation; they waved their hats and in some cases their wigs, they reached through their frames to grip each other’s hands; they danced up and down on their chairs in which they have been painted: Dilys Derwent sobbed unashamedly; Dexter Fortescue was waving his ear-trumpet; and Phineas Niggelus called, in his high, reedy voice, \"And let it be noted that Slytherin House played its part! Let our contribution not be forgotten!\" But Harry had eyes only for the man who stood in the largest portrait directly behind the headmaster’s chair. Tears were sliding down from behind the half-moon spectacles into the long silver beard, and the pride and the gratitude emanating from him filled Harry wit h the same balm as phoenix song. At last, Harry held up his hands, and the portraits fell respectfully silent, beaming and mopping their eyes and waiting eagerly for him to speak. He directed his words at Dumbledore, however, and chose them with enormous care. Exhausted and bleary-eyed though he was, he must make one last effort, seeking one last piece of advice. \"The thing that was hidden in the Snitch,\" he began, \"I dropped it in the forest. I don’t exactly here, but I’m not going to go looking for it again. Do you agree?\" \"My dear boy, I do,\" said Dumbledore, while his fellow pictures looked confused and curious. \"A wise and courageous decision, but no less than I would have expected of you. Does anyone know else know where it fell?\" \"No one,\" said Harry, and Dumbledore nodded his satisfaction. \"I’m going to keep Ignotus’s present, though,\" said Harry, and Dumbledore beamed. \"But of course, Harry, it is yours forever, until you pass it on!\" \"And then there’s this.\" Harry held up the Elder Wand, and Ron and Hermione looked at it with a reverence that, even in his befuddled and sleep-deprived state, Harry did not like to see. \"I don’t want it.\" said Harry. \"What?\" said Ron loudly. \"Are you mental?\" \"I know it’s powerful,\" said Harry wearily. \"But I was happier with mine. So . . .\" He rummaged in the pouch hung around his neck, and pulled out the two halves of holly tstill just connected by the finest threat of phoenix feather. Hermione had said that they could not be repaired, that the damage was too severe. All he knew was that if this did not work, nothing would. He laid the broken wand upon the headmaster’s desk, touched it with the very tip of the Elder Wand, and said, \"Reparo.\" As his wand resealed, red sparks flew out of its end. Harry knew that he had succeeded. He picked up the holly and phoenix wand and felt a sudden warmth in his fingers, as though wand and hand were rejoicing at their reunion. \"I’m putting the Elder Wand,\" he told Dumbledore, who was watching him with enormous affection and admiration, \"back where it came from. It can stay there. If I die a natural death like Ignotus, its power will be broken, won’t it? The previous master will never have been defeated. That’ll be the end of it. Dumbledore nodded. They smiled at each other. \"Are you sure?\" said Ron. There was the faintest trace of longing in his voice as he looked at the Elder Wand. \"I think Harry’s right,\" said Hermione quietly. \"That wand’s more trouble than it’s worth.\" said Harry. \"And quite honestly,\" he turned away from the painted portraits, thinking now only of the four-poster bed lying waiting for him in Gryffindor Tower, and wondering whether Kreacher might bring him a sandwich there, \"I’ve had enough trouble for a lifetime.\" Epilogue Nineteen Years Later Autumn seemed to arrive suddenly that year. The morning of the first of September was crisp as an apple, and as the little family bobbed across the rumbling road toward the great sooty station, the fumes of car exhausts and the breath of pedestrians sparkled like cobwebs in the cold air. Two large cages tattled on top of the laden trolleys the parents were pushing; the owls inside them hooted indignantly, and the redheaded girl trailed fearfully behind here brothers, clutching her father's arm. \"It won't be long, and you'll be going too,\" Harry told her. \"Two years,\" sniffed Lily. \"I want to go now!\" The commuters stared curiously at the owls as the family wove its way toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten, Albus's voice drifted back to Harry over the surrounding clamor; his sons had resumed the argument they had started in the car. \"I won't! I won't be a Slytherin!\" \"James, give it a rest!\" said Ginny. \"I only said he might be,\" said James, grinning at his younger brother. \"There's nothing wrong with that. He might be in Slytherin\" But James caught his mother's eye and fell silent. The five Potters approached the barrier. With a slightly cocky look over his shoulder at his younger brother, James took the trolley from his mother and broke into a run. A moment later, he had vanished. \"You'll write to me, won't you?\" Albus asked his parents immediately, capitalizing on the momentary absence of his brother. \"Every day, of you want us to,\" said Ginny. \"Not every day,\" said Albus quickly, \"James says most people only get letters from home about once a month.\" \"We wrote to James three times a week last year,\" said Ginny. \"And you don't want to believe everything he tells you about Hogwarts,\" Harry put in. \"He likes a laugh, your brother.\" Side by side, they pushed the second trolley forward, gathering speed. As they reached the barrier, Albus winced, but no collision came. Instead, the family emerged onto platform nine and three-quarters, which was obscured by thick white steam that was pouring from the scarlet Hogwarts Express. Indistinct figures were swarming through the mist, into which James had already disappeared. \"Where are they?\" asked Albus anxiously, peering at the hazy forms they passed as they made their way down the platform. \"We'll find them,\" said Ginny reassuringly. But the vapor was dense, and it was difficult to make out anybody's faces. Detached from their owners, voices sounded unnaturally loud, Harry thought he head Percy discoursing loudly on broomstick regulations, and was quite glad of the excuse not to stop and say hello. . . . \"I think that's them, Al,\" said Ginny suddenly. A group of four people emerged from the mist, standing alongside the very last carriage. Their faces only came into focus when Harry, Ginny, Lily, and Albus had drawn right up to them. \"Hi,\" said Albus, sounding immensely relieved. Roses, who was already wearing her brand-new Hogwarts robes, beamed at him. \"Parked all right, then?\" Ron asked Harry. \"I did. Hermione didn't believe I could pass a Muggle driving test, did you? She thought I'd have to Confound the examiner.\" \"No, I didn't,\" said Hermione, \"I had complete faith in you.\" \"As a matter of fact, I did Confund him,\" Ron whispered to Harry, as together they lifted Albus's trunk and owl onto the train. \"I only forgot to look in the wing mirror, and let's face it, I can use a Supersensory Charm for that.\" Back on the platform, they found Lily and Hugo, Rose's younger brother, having an animated discussion about which House they would be sorted into when they finally went to Hogwarts. \"If you're not in Gryffindor, we'll disinherit you,\" said Ron, \"but no pressure.\" \"Ron!\" Lily and Hugo laughed, but Albus and Rose looked solemn. \"He doesn't mean it,\" said Hermione and Ginny, but Ron was no longer paying attention. Catching Harry's eye, he nodded covertly to a point some fifty yards away. The steam had thinned for a moment, and three people stood in sharp relief against the shifting mist. \"Look who it is.\" Draco Malfoy was standing there with his wife and son, a dark coat buttoned up to his throat. His hair was receding somewhat, which emphasized the pointed chin. The new boy resembled Draco as much as Albus resembled Harry. Draco caught sight of Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny staring at him, nodded curtly, and turned away again. \"So that's little Scorpius,\" said Ron under his breath. \"Make sure you beat him in every test, Rosie. Thank God you inherited your mother's brains.\" \"Ron, for heaven's sake,\" said Hermione, half stern, half amused. \"Don't try to turn them against each other before they've even started school!\" \"You're right, sorry,\" said Ron, but unable to help himself, he added, \"Don't get too friendly with him, though, Rosie. Granddad Weasley would never forgive you if you married a pureblood.\" \"Hey!\" James had reappeared; he had divested himself of his trunk, owl, and trolley, and was evidently bursting with news. \"Teddy's back there,\" he said breathlessly, pointing back over his shoulder into the billowing clouds of steam. \"Just seen him! And guess what he's doing? Snogging Victoire!\" He gazed up at the adults, evidently disappointed by the lack of reaction. \"Our Teddy! Teddy Lupin! Snogging our Victoire! Our cousin! And I asked teddy what he was doing --\" \"You interrupted them?\" said Ginny. \"You are so like Ron --\" \"-- and he said he'd come to see her off! And then he told me to go away. He's snogging her!\" James added as though worried he had not made himself clear. \"Oh, it would be lovely if they got married!\" whispered Lily ecstatically. \"Teddy would really be part of the family then!\" \"He already comes round for dinner about four times a week,\" said Harry \"Why don't we just invite him to live with is and have done with it?\" \"Yeah!\" said James enthusiastically. \"I don't mind sharing with Al--Teddy could have my room!\" \"No,\" said Harry firmly, \"you and Al will share a room only when I want the house demolished.\" He checked the battered old watch that had once been Fabian Prewett's. \"It's nearly eleven, you'd better get on board.\" \"Don't forget to give Neville our love!\" Ginny told James as she hugged him. \"Mum! I can't give a professor love!\" \"But you know Neville--\" James rolled his eyes. \"Outside, yeah, but at school he's Professor Longbottom, isn't he? I can't walk into Herbology and give him love. . . .\" Shaking his head at his mother's foolishness, he vented his feelings by aiming a kick at Albus. \"See you later, Al. Watch out for the thestrals.\" \"I thought they were invisible? You said they were invisible!\" but James merely laughed, permitted his mother to kiss him, gave his father a fleeting hug, then leapt onto the rapidly filling train. They saw him wave, then sprint away up the corridor to find his friends. \"Thestrals are nothing to worry about,\" Harry told Albus. \"They're gentle things, there's nothing scare about them. Anyway, you won't be going up to school in the carriages, you'll be going in the boats.\" Ginny kissed Albus good-bye. \"See you at Christmas.\" \"Bye, Al,\" said Harry as his son hugged him. \"Don't forget Hagrid's invited you to tea next Friday. Don't mess with Peeves. Don't duel anyone till you're learned how. And don't let James wind you up.\" \"What if I'm in Slytherin?\" The whisper was for his father alone, and Harry knew that only the moment of departure could have forced Albus to reveal how great and sincere that fear was. Harry crouched down so that Albus's face was slightly above his own. Alone of Harry's three children, Albus had inherited Lily's eyes. \"Ablus Severus,\" Harry said quietly, so that nobody but Ginny could hear, and she was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to rose, who was now on the train, \"you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.\" \"But just say--\" \"--then Slytherin House will have gained an excellent student, won't it? It doesn't matter to us, Al. But if it matter to you, you'll be able to choose Gryffindor over Slytherin. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.\" \"Really?\" \"It did for me,\" said Harry. He had never told any of his children that before, and he saw the wonder in Albus's face when he said it. But how the doorsr were slamming all along the scarlet train, and the blurred outlines of parents swarming forward for final kisses, last-minute reminders, Albus jumped into the carriage and ginny closed the door behind him. Students were hanging from the windows nearest them. A great number of faces, both on the train and off, seemed to be turned toward Harry. \"Why are they all staring?\" demanded Albus as he and rose craned around to look at the other students. \"Don't let it worry you,\" said Ron. \"It's me, I'm extremely famous.\" Albus, Rose, Hugo, and Lily laughed. The train began to more, and Harry walked alongside it, watching his son's thin face, already ablaze with excitement. Harry kept smiling and waving, even though it was like a little bereavement, watching his son glide away from him. . . . The last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn air. The train rounded a corner. Harry's hand was still raised in farewell. \"He'll be alright,\" murmured Ginny. As Harry looked dat her, he lowered his hand absentmindedly and touched the lightning scar on his forehead. \"I know he will.\" The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well.\n",

            " The Seven Potters Harry ran back upstairs to his bedroom, arriving at the window just in time to see the Dursleys' car swinging out of the drive and off up the road. Dedalus’s top hat was visible between Aunt Petunia and Dudley in the backseat. The car turned right at the end of Privet Drive, its windows burned scarlet for a moment in the now setting sun, and then it was gone. Harry picked up Hedwig’s cage, his Firebolt, and his rucksack, gave his unnaturally tidy bedroom one last sweeping look, and then made his ungainly way back downstairs to the hall, where he deposited cage, broomstick, and bag near the foot of the stairs. The light was fading rapidly, the hall full of shadows in the evening light. It felt most strange to stand here in the silence and know that he was about to leave the house for the last time. Long ago, when he had been left alone while the Dursleys went out to enjoy themselves, the hours of solitude had been a rare treat. Pausing only to sneak something tasty from the fridge, he had rushed upstairs to play on Dudley’s computer, or put on the television and flicked through the channels to his heart’s content. It gave him an odd, empty feeling remembering those times; it was like remembering a younger brother whom he had lost. \"Don’t you want to take a last look at the place?\" he asked Hedwig, who was still sulking with her head under her wing. \"We’ll never be here again. Don’t you want to remember all the good times? I mean, look at this doormat. What memories ... Dudley sobbed on it after I saved him from the dementors ... Turns out he was grateful after all, can you believe it? ... And last summer, Dumbledore walked through that front door ... \" Harry lost the thread of his thoughts for a moment and Hedwig did nothing to help him retrieve it, but continued to sit with her head under her wing. Harry turned his back on the front door. \"And under here, Hedwig\" - Harry pulled open a door under the stairs - \"is where I used to sleep! You never knew me then - Blimey, it’s small, I’d forgotten ... \" Harry looked around at the stacked shoes and umbrellas remembering how he used to wake every morning looking up at the underside of the staircase, which was more often than not adorned with a spider or two. Those had been the days before he had known anything about his true identity; before he had found out how his parents had died or why such strange things often happened around him. But Harry could still remember the dreams that had dogged him, even in those days: confused dreams involving flashes of green light and once - Uncle Vernon had nearly crashed the car when Harry had recounted it - a flying motorbike ... There was a sudden, deafening roar from somewhere nearby. Harry straightened up with a jerk and smacked the top of his head on the low door frame. Pausing only to employ a few of Uncle Vernon’s choicest swear words, he staggered back into the kitchen, clutching his head and staring out of the window into the back garden. The darkness seemed to be rippling, the air itself quivering. Then, one by one, figures began to pop into sight as their Disillusionment Charms lifted. Dominating the scene was Hagrid, wearing a helmet and goggles and sitting astride an enormous motorbike with a black sidecar attached. All around him other people were dismounting from brooms and, in two cases, skeletal, black winged horses. Wrenching open the back door, Harry hurtled into their midst. There was a general cry of greeting as Hermione flung her arms around him, Ron clapped him on the back, and Hagrid said, \"All righ’, Harry? Ready fer the off?\" \"Definitely,\" said Harry, beaming around at them all. \"But I wasn’t expecting this many of you!\" \"Change of plan,\" growled Mad-Eye, who was holding two enormous bulging sacks, and whose magical eye was spinning from darkening sky to house to garden with dizzying rapidity. \"Let’s get undercover before we talk you through it.\" Harry led them all back into the kitchen where, laughing and chattering, they settled on chairs, sat themselves upon Aunt Petunia’s gleaming work surfaces, or leaned up against her spotless appliances; Ron, long and lanky; Hermione, her bushy hair tied back in a long plait; Fred and George, grinning identically; Bill, badly scarred and long-haired; Mr. Weasley, kind-faced, balding, his spectacles a little awry; Mad-Eye, battle-worn, one-legged, his bright blue magical eye whizzing in its socket; Tonks, whose short hair was her favorite shade of bright pink; Lupin, grayer, more lined; Fleur, slender and beautiful, with her long silvery blonde hair; Kingsley, bald and broad-shouldered; Hagrid, with his wild hair and beard, standing hunchbacked to avoid hitting his head on the ceiling; and Mundungus Fletcher, small, dirty, and hangdog, with his droopy beady hound’s eyes and matted hair. Harry’s heart seemed to expand and glow at the sight: He felt incredibly fond of all of them, even Mundungus, whom he had tried to strangle the last time they had met. \"Kingsley, I thought you were looking after the Muggle Prime Minister?\" he called across the room. \"He can get along without me for one night,\" said Kingsley, \"You’re more important.\" \"Harry, guess what?\" said Tonks from her perch on top of the washing machine, and she wiggled her left hand at him; a ring glistened there. \"You got married?\" Harry yelped, looking from her to Lupin. \"I’m sorry you couldn’t be there, Harry, it was very quiet.\" \"That’s brilliant, congrat -\" \"All right, all right, we’ll have time for a cozy catch-up later,\" roared Moody over the hubbub, and silence fell in the kitchen. Moody dropped his sacks at his feet and turned to Harry. \"As Dedalus probably told you, we had to abandon Plan A. Pius Thicknesse has gone over, which gives us a big problem. He’s made it an imprisonable offense to connect this house to the Floo Network, place a Portkey here, or Apparate in or out. All done in the name of your protection, to prevent You-Know-Who getting in at you. Absolutely pointless, seeing as your mother’s charm does that already. What he’s really done is to stop you getting out of here safely.\" \"Second problem: You’re underage, which means you’ve still got the Trace on you.\" \"I don’t -\" \"The Trace, the Trace!\" said Mad-Eye impatiently. \"The charm that detects magical activity around under-seventeens, the way the Ministry finds out about underage magic! If you, or anyone around you, casts a spell to get you out of here, Thicknesse is going to know about it, and so will the Death Eaters.\" \"We can’t wait for the Trace to break, because the moment you turn seventeen you’ll lose all the protection your mother gave you. In short, Pius Thicknesse thinks he’s got you cornered good and proper.\" Harry could not help but agree with the unknown Thicknesse. \"So what are we going to do?\" \"We’re going to use the only means of transport left to us, the only ones the Trace can’t detect, because we don’t need to cast spells to use them: brooms, thestrals, and Hagrid’s motorbike.\" Harry could see flaws in this plan; however, he held his tongue to give Mad-Eye the chance to address them. \"Now, your mother’s charm will only break under two conditions: when you come of age, or\" - Moody gestured around the pristine kitchen - \"you no longer call this place home. You and your aunt and uncle are going your separate ways tonight, in the full understanding that you’re never going to live together again, correct?\" Harry nodded. \"So this time, when you leave, there’ll be no going back, and the charm will break the moment you get outside its range. We’re choosing to break it early, because the alternative is waiting for You-Know-Who to come and seize you the moment you turn seventeen. \"The one thing we’ve got on our side is that You-Know-Who doesn’t know we’re moving you tonight. We’ve leaked a fake trail to the Ministry: They think you’re not leaving until the thirtieth. However, this is You-Know-Who we’re dealing with, so we can’t rely on him getting the date wrong; he’s bound to have a couple of Death Eaters patrolling the skies in this general area, just in case. So, we’ve given a dozen different houses every protection we can throw at them. They all look like they could be the place we’re going to hide you, they’ve all got some connection with the Order: my house, Kingsley’s place, Molly’s Auntie Muriel’s - you get the idea.\" \"Yeah,\" said Harry, not entirely truthfully, because he could still spot a gaping hole in the plan. \"You’ll be going to Tonks’s parents. Once you’re within the boundaries of the protective enchantments we’ve put on their house you’ll be able to use a Portkey to the Burrow. Any questions?\" \"Er - yes,\" said Harry. \"Maybe they won’t know which of the twelve secure houses I’m heading for at first, but won’t it be sort of obvious once\" - he performed a quick headcount - \"fourteen of us fly off toward Tonks’s parents?\" \"Ah,\" said Moody, \"I forgot to mention the key point. Fourteen of us won’t be flying to Tonks’s parents. There will be seven Harry Potters moving through the skies tonight, each of them with a companion, each pair heading for a different safe house.\" From inside his cloak Moody now withdrew a flask of what looked like mud. There was no need for him to say another word; Harry understood the rest of the plan immediately. \"No!\" he said loudly, his voice ringing through the kitchen. \"No way!\" \"I told them you’d take it like this,\" said Hermione with a hint of complacency. \"If you think I’m going to let six people risk their lives -- !\" \"-because it’s the first time for all of us,\" said Ron. \"This is different, pretending to be me -\" \"Well, none of us really fancy it, Harry,\" said Fred earnestly. \"Imagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as specky, scrawny gits forever.\" Harry did not smile. \"You can’t do it if I don’t cooperate, you need me to give you some hair.\" \"Well, that’s the plan scuppered,\" said George. \"Obviously there’s no chance at all of us getting a bit of your hair unless you cooperate.\" \"Yeah, thirteen of us against one bloke who’s not allowed to use magic; we’ve got no chance,\" said Fred. \"Funny,\" said Harry, \"really amusing.\" \"If it has to come to force, then it will,\" growled Moody, his magical eye now quivering a little in its socket as he glared at Harry. \"Everyone here’s overage, Potter, and they’re all prepared to take the risk.\" Mundungus shrugged and grimaced; the magical eye swerved sideways to glance at him out of the side of Moody’s head. \"Let’s have no more arguments. Time’s wearing on. I want a few of your hairs, boy, now.\" \"But this is mad, there’s no need -\" \"No need!\" snarled Moody. \"With You-Know-Who out there and half the Ministry on his side? Potter, if we’re lucky he’ll have swallowed the fake bait and he’ll be planning to ambush you on the thirtieth, but he’d be mad not to have a Death Eater or two keeping an eye out, it’s what I’d do. They might not be able to get at you or this house while your mother’s charm holds, but it’s about to break and they know the rough position of the place. Our only chance is to use decoys. Even You-Know-Who can’t split himself into seven.\" Harry caught Hermione’s eye and looked away at once. \"So, Potter - some of your hair, if you please.\" Harry glanced at Ron, who grimaced at him in a just-do-it sort of way. \"Now!\" barked Moody. With all of their eyes upon him, Harry reached up to the top of his head, grabbed a hank of hair, and pulled. \"Good,\" said Moody, limping forward as he pulled the stopper out of the flask of potion. \"Straight in here, if you please.\" Harry dropped the hair into the mudlike liquid. The moment it made contact with its surface, the potion began to froth and smoke, then, all at once, it turned a clear, bright gold. \"Ooh, you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle, Harry,\" said Hermione, before catching sight of Ron’s raised eyebrows, blushing slightly, and saying, \"Oh, you know what I mean - Goyle’s potion tasted like bogies.\" \"Right then, fake Potters line up over here, please,\" said Moody. Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Fleur lined up in front of Aunt Petunia’s gleaming sink. \"We’re one short,\" said Lupin. \"Here,\" said Hagrid gruffly, and he lifted Mundungus by the scruff of the neck and dropped him down beside Fleur, who wrinkled her nose pointedly and moved along to stand between Fred and George instead. \"I’m a soldier, I’d sooner be a protector,\" said Mundungus. \"Shut it,\" growled Moody. \"As I’ve already told you, you spineless worm, any Death Eaters we run into will be aiming to capture Potter, not kill him. Dumbledore always said You-Know-Who would want to finish Potter in person. It’ll be the protectors who have got the most to worry about, the Death Eaters’ll want to kill them.\" Mundungus did not look particularly reassured, but Moody was already pulling half a dozen eggcup-sized glasses from inside his cloak, which he handed out, before pouring a little Polyjuice Potion into each one. \"Altogether, then ... \" Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, Fleur, and Mundungus drank. All of them gasped and grimaced as the potion hit their throats; At once, their features began to bubble and distort like hot wax. Hermione and Mundungus were shooting upward; Ron, Fred, and George were shrinking; their hair was darkening, Hermione’s and Fleur’s appearing to shoot backward into their skulls. Moody, quite unconcerned, was now loosening the ties of the large sacks he had brought with him. When he straightened up again, there were six Harry Potters gasping and panting in front of him. Fred and George turned to each other and said together, \"Wow - we’re identical!\" \"I dunno, though, I think I’m still better-looking,\" said Fred, examining his reflection in the kettle. \"Bah,\" said Fleur, checking herself in the microwave door, \"Bill, don’t look at me - I’m ‘ideous.\" \"Those whose clothes are a bit roomy, I’ve got smaller here,\" said Moody, indicating the first sack, \"and vice versa. Don’t forget the glasses, there’s six pairs in the side pocket. And when you’re dressed, there’s luggage in the other sack.\" The real Harry thought that this might just be the most bizarre thing he had ever seen, and he had seen some extremely odd things. He watched as his six doppelgangers rummaged in the sacks, pulling out sets of clothes, putting on glasses, stuffing their own things away. He felt like asking them to show a little more respect for privacy as they all began stripping off with impunity, clearly more at ease with displaying his body than they would have been with their own. \"I knew Ginny was lying about that tattoo,\" said Ron, looking down at his bare chest. \"Harry, your eyesight really is awful,\" said Hermione, as she put on glasses. Once dressed, the fake Harrys took rucksacks and owl cages, each containing a stuffed snowy owl, from the second sack. \"Good,\" said Moody, as at last seven dressed, bespectacled, and luggage-laden Harrys faced him. \"The pairs will be as follows: Mundungus will be traveling with me, by broom -\" \"Why’m I with you?\" grunted the Harry nearest the back door. \"Because you’re the one that needs watching,\" growled Moody, and sure enough, his magical eye did not waver from Mundungus as he continued, \"Arthur and Fred -\" \"I’m George,\" said the twin at whom Moody was pointing. \"Can’t you even tell us apart when we’re Harry?\" \"Sorry, George -\" \"I’m only yanking your wand, I’m Fred really -\" \"Enough messing around!\" snarled Moody. \"The other one - George or Fred or whoever you are - you’re with Remus. Miss Delacour -\" \"I’m taking Fleur on a thestral,\" said Bill. \"She’s not that fond of brooms.\" Fleur walked over to stand beside him, giving him a soppy, slavish look that Harry hoped with all his heart would never appear on his face again. \"Miss Granger with Kingsley, again by thestral -\" Hermione looked reassured as she answered Kingsley’s smile; Harry knew that Hermione too lacked confidence on a broomstick. \"Which leaves you and me, Ron!\" said Tonks brightly, knocking over a mug tree as she waved at him. Ron did not look quite as pleased as Hermione. \"An’ you’re with me, Harry. That all righ’?\" said Hagrid, looking a little anxious. \"We’ll be on the bike, brooms an’ thestrals can’t take me weight, see. Not a lot o’ room on the seat with me on it, though, so you’ll be in the sidecar.\" \"That’s great,\" said Harry, not altogether truthfully. \"We think the Death Eaters will expect you to be on a broom,\" said Moody, who seemed to guess how Harry was feeling. \"Snape’s had plenty of time to tell them everything about you he’s never mentioned before, so if we do run into any Death Eaters, we’re betting they’ll choose one of the Potters who looks at home on a broomstick. All right then,\" he went on, tying up the sack with the fake Potters’ clothes in it and leading the way back to the door, \"I make it three minutes until we’re supposed to leave. No point locking the back door, it won’t keep the Death Eaters out when they come looking. Come on ...\" Harry hurried to gather his rucksack, Firebolt, and Hedwig’s cage and followed the group to the dark back garden. On every side broomsticks were leaping into hands; Hermione had already been helped up onto a great black thestral by Kingsley, Fleur onto the other by Bill. Hagrid was standing ready beside the motorbike, goggles on. \"Is this it? Is this Sirius’s bike?\" \"The very same,\" said Hagrid, beaming down at Harry. \"An’ the last time yeh was on it, Harry, I could fit yeh in one hand!\" Harry could not help but feel a little humiliated as he got into the sidecar. It placed him several feet below everybody else: Ron smirked at the sight of him sitting there like a child in a bumper car. Harry stuffed his rucksack and broomstick down by his feet and rammed Hedwig’s cage between his knees. He was extremely uncomfortable. \"Arthur’s done a bit o’ tinkerin’,\" said Hagrid, quite oblivious to Harry’s discomfort. He settled himself astride the motorcycle, which creaked slightly and sank inches into the ground. \"It’s got a few tricks up its sleeves now. Tha’ one was my idea.\" He pointed a thick finger at a purple button near the speedometer. \"Please be careful, Hagrid.\" said Mr. Weasley, who was standing beside them, holding his broomstick. \"I'm still not sure that was advisable and it's certainly only to be used in emergencies.\" \"All right, then.\" said Moody. \"Everyone ready, please. I want us all to leave at exactly the same time or the whole point of the diversion's lost.\" Everybody motioned their heads. \"Hold tight now, Ron,\" said Tonks, and Harry saw Ron throw a forcing, guilty look at Lupin before placing his hands on each side of her waist. Hagrid kicked the motorbike into life: It roared like a dragon, and the sidecar began to vibrate. \"Good luck, everyone,\" shouted Moody. \"See you all in about an hour at the Burrow. On the count of three. One ... two .. THREE.\" There was a great roar from the motorbike, and Harry felt the sidecar give a nasty lurch. He was rising through the air fast, his eyes watering slightly, hair whipped back off his face. Around him brooms were soaring upward too; the long black tail of a thestral flicked past. His legs, jammed into the sidecar by Hedwig’s cage and his rucksack, were already sore and starting to go numb. So great was his discomfort that he almost forgot to take a last glimpse of number four Privet Drive. By the time he looked over the edge of the sidecar he could no longer tell which one it was. And then, out of nowhere, out of nothing, they were surrounded. At least thirty hooded figures, suspended in midair, formed a vast circle in the middle of which the Order members had risen, oblivious - Screams, a blaze of green light on every side: Hagrid gave a yell and the motorbike rolled over. Harry lost any sense of where they were. Streetlights above him, yells around him, he was clinging to the sidecar for dear life. Hedwig's cage, the Firebolt, and his rucksack slipped from beneath his knees - \"No - HELP!\" The broomstick spun too, but he just managed to seize the strap of his rucksack and the top of the cage as the motorbike swung the right way up again. A second's relief, and then another burst of green light. The owl screeched and fell to the floor of the cage. \"No - NO!\" The motorbike zoomed forward; Harry glimpsed hooded Death Eaters scattering as Hagrid blasted through their circle. \"Hedwig - Hedwig -\" But the owl lay motionless and pathetic as a toy on the floor of her cage. He could not take it in, and his terror for the others was paramount. He glanced over his shoulder and saw a mass of people moving, flares of green light, two pairs of people on brooms soaring off into the distance, but he could not tell who they were - \"Hagrid, we've got to go back, we've got to go back!\" he yelled over the thunderous roar of the engine, pulling out his wand, ramming Hedwig's cage into the floor, refusing to believe that she was dead. \"Hagrid, TURN AROUND!\" \"My job's ter get you there safe, Harry!\" bellow Hagrid, and he opened the throttle. \"Stop - STOP!\" Harry shouted, but as he looked back again two jets of green light flew past his left ear: Four Death Eaters had broken away from the circle and were pursuing them, aiming for Hagrid's broad back. Hagrid swerved, but the Death Eaters were keeping up with the bike; more curses shot after them, and Harry had to sink low into the sidecar to avoid them. Wriggling around he cried, \"Stupefy!\" and a red bolt of light shot from his own wand, cleaving a gap between the four pursuing Death Eaters as they scattered to avoid it. \"Hold on, Harry, this'll do for 'em!\" roared Hagrid, and Harry looked up just in time to see Hagrid slamming a thick finger into a green button near the fuel gauge. A wall, a solid black wall, erupted out of the exhaust pipe. Craning his neck, Harry saw it expand into being in midair. Three of the Death Eaters swerved and avoided it, but the fourth was not so lucky; He vanished from view and then dropped like a boulder from behind it, his broomstick broken into pieces. One of his fellows slowed up to save him, but they and the airborne wall were swallowed by darkness as Hagrid leaned low over the handlebars and sped up. More Killing Curses flew past Harry's head from the two remaining Death Eaters' wands; they were aiming for Hagrid. Harry responded with further Stunning Spells: Red and green collided in midair in a shower of multicolored sparks, and Harry thought wildly of fireworks, and the Muggles below who would have no idea what was happening - \"Here we go again, Harry, hold on!\" yelled Hagrid, and he jabbed at a second button. This time a great net burst from the bike's exhaust, but the Death Eaters were ready for it. Not only did they swerve to avoid it, but the companion who had slowed to save their unconscious friend had caught up. He bloomed suddenly out of the darkness and now three of them were pursuing the motorbike, all shooting curses after it. \"This'll do it, Harry, hold on tight!\" yelled Hagrid, and Harry saw him slam his whole hand onto the purple button beside the speedometer. With an unmistakable bellowing roar, dragon fire burst from the exhaust, white-hot and blue, and the motorbike shot forward like a bullet with a sound of wrenching metal. Harry saw the Death Eaters swerve out of sight to avoid the deadly trail of flame, and at the same time felt the sidecar sway ominously: Its metal connections to the bike had splintered with the force of acceleration. \"It's all righ', Harry!\" bellowed Hagrid, now thrown flat onto the back by the surge of speed; nobody was steering now, and the sidecar was starting to twist violently in the bike's slipstream. \"I'm on it, Harry, don' worry!\" Hagrid yelled, and from inside his jacket pocket he pulled his flowery pink umbrella. \"Hagrid! No! Let me!\" \"REPARO!\" There was a deafening bang and the sidecar broke away from the bike completely. Harry sped forward, propelled by the impetus of the bike's flight, then the sidecar began to lose height - In desperation Harry pointed his wand at the sidecar and shouted, \"Wingardium Leviosa!\" The sidecar rose like a cork, unsteerable but at least still airborne. He had but a split second's relief, however, as more curses streaked past him: The three Death Eaters were closing in. \"I'm comin', Harry!\" Hagrid yelled from out of the darkness, but Harry could feel the sidecar beginning to sink again: Crouching as low as he could, he pointed at the middle of the oncoming figures and yelled, \"Impedimenta!\" The jinx hit the middle Death Eater in the chest; For a moment the man was absurdly spread-eagled in midair as though he had hit an invisible barrier: One of his fellows almost collided with him - Then the sidecar began to fall in earnest, and the remaining Death Eater shot a curse so close to Harry that he had to duck below the rim of the car, knocking out a tooth on the edge of his seat - \"I'm comin', Harry, I'm comin'!\" A huge hand seized the back of Harry's robes and hoisted him out of the plummeting sidecar; Harry pulled his rucksack with him as he dragged himself onto the motorbike's seat and found himself back-to-back with Hagrid. As they soared upward, away from the two remaining Death Eaters, Harry spat blood out of his mouth, pointed his wand at the falling sidecar, and yelled, \"Confringo!\" He knew a dreadful, gut-wrenching pang for Hedwig as it exploded; the Death Eater nearest it was blasted off his broom and fell from sight; his companion fell back and vanished. \"Harry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,\" moaned Hagrid, \"I shouldn'ta tried ter repair it meself - yeh've got no room -\" \"It's not a problem, just keep flying!\" Harry shouted back, as two more Death Eaters emerged out of the darkness, drawing closer. As the curses came shooting across the intervening space again, Hagrid swerved and zigzagged: Harry knew that Hagrid did not dare use the dragon-fire button again, with Harry seated so insecurely. Harry sent Stunning Spell after Stunning Spell back at their pursuers, barely holding them off. He shot another blocking jinx at them: The closest Death Eater swerved to avoid it and his hood slipped, and by the red light of his next Stunning Spell, Harry saw the strangely blank face of Stanley Shunpike - Stan - \"Expelliarmus!\" Harry yelled. \"That's him, it's him, it's the real one!\" The hooded Death Eater's shout reached Harry even above the thunder of the motorbike's engine: Next moment, both pursuers had fallen back and disappeared from view. \"Harry, what's happened?\" bellowed Hagrid. \"Where've they gone?\" \"I don't know!\" But Harry was afraid: The hooded Death Eater had shouted, \"It's the real one!\"; how had he known? He gazed around at the apparently empty darkness and felt its menace. Where were they? He clambered around on the seat to face forward and seized hold of the back of Hagrid's jacket. \"Hagrid, do the dragon-fire thing again, let's get out of here!\" \"Hold on tight, then, Harry!\" There was a deafening, screeching roar again and the white-blue fire shot from the exhaust: Harry felt himself slipping backwards off what little of the seat he had. Hagrid flung backward upon him, barely maintaining his grip on the handlebars - \"I think we've lost 'em Harry, I think we've done it!\" yelled Hagrid. But Harry was not convinced; Fear lapped at him as he looked left and right for pursuers he was sure would come. . . . Why had they fallen back? One of them had still had a wand. . . . It's him. . . it's the real one. . . . They had said it right after he had tried to Disarm Stan. . . . \"We're nearly there, Harry, we've nearly made it!\" shouted Hagrid. Harry felt the bike drop a little, though the lights down on the ground still seemed remote as stars. Then the scar on his forehead burned like fire: as a Death Eater appeared on either side of the bike, two Killing Curses missed Harry by millimeters, cast from behind - And then Harry saw him. Voldemort was flying like smoke on the wind, without broomstick or thestral to hold him, his snake-like face gleaming out of the blackness, his white fingers raising his wand again - Hagrid let out a bellow of fear and steered the motorbike into a vertical dive. Clinging on for dear life, Harry sent Stunning Spells flying at random into the whirling night. He saw a body fly past him and knew he had hit one of them, but then he heard a bang and saw sparks from the engine; the motorbike spiraled through the air, completely out of control - Green jets of light shot past them again. Harry had no idea which way was up, which down: His scar was still burning; he expected to die at any second. A hooded figure on a broomstick was feet from him, he saw it raise its arm - \"NO!\" With a shout of fury Hagrid launched himself off the bike at the Death Eater; to his horror, Harry saw both Hagrid and the Death Eater, falling out of sight, their combined weight too much for the broomstick - Barely gripping the plummeting bike with his knees, Harry heard Voldemort scream, \"Mine!\" It was over: He could not see or hear where Voldemort was; he glimpsed another Death Eater swooping out of the way and heard, \"Avada -\" As the pain from Harry's scar forced his eyes shut, his wand acted of its own accord. He felt it drag his hand around like some great magnet, saw a spurt of golden fire through his half-closed eyelids, heard a crack and a scream of fury. The remaining Death Eater yelled; Voldemort screamed, \"NO!\" Somehow, Harry found his nose an inch from the dragon-fire button. He punched it with his wand-free hand and the bike shot more flames into the air, hurtling straight toward the ground. \"Hagrid!\" Harry called, holding on to the bike for dear life. \"Hagrid - Accio Hagrid!\" The motorbike sped up, sucked towards the earth. Face level with the handlebars, Harry could see nothing but distant lights growing nearer and nearer: He was going to crash and there was nothing he could do about it. Behind him came another scream, \"Your wand, Selwyn, give me your wand!\" He felt Voldemort before he saw him. Looking sideways, he stared into the red eyes and was sure they would be the last thing he ever saw: Voldemort preparing to curse him once more - And then Voldemort vanished. Harry looked down and saw Hagrid spread-eagled on the ground below him. He pulled hard at the handlebars to avoid hitting him, groped for the brake, but with an earsplitting, ground trembling crash, he smashed into a muddy pond. \n",

            "-Two The Deathly Hallows Harry fell, panting, onto grass and scrambled up at once. They seemed to have landed in the corner of a field at dusk; Hermione was already running in a circle around them, waving her wand. \"Protego Totalum...Salvio Hexia...\" \"That treacherous old bleeder.\" Ron panted, emerging from beneath the Invisibility Cloak and throwing it to Harry. \"Hermione you’re a genius, a total genius. I can’t believe we got out of that.\" \"Cave Inimicum...Didn’t I say it was an Frumpent horn, didn’t I tell him? And now his house has been blown apart!\" \"Serves him right,\" said Ron, examining his torn jeans and the cuts to his legs, \"What’d you reckon they’ll do to him?\" \"Oh I hope they don’t kill him!\" groaned Hermione, \"That’s why I wanted the Death Eaters to get a glimpse of Harry before we left, so they knew Xenophilius hadn’t been lying!\" \"Why hide me though?\" asked Ron. \"You’re supposed to be in bed with spattergrolt, Ron! They’ve kidnapped Luna because her father supported Harry! What would happen to your family if they knew you’re with him?\" \"But what about your mum and dad?\" \"They’re in Australia,\" said Hermione, \"They should be all right. They don’t know anything.\" \"You’re a genius,\" Ron repeated, looking awed. Yeah, you are, Hermione,\" agreed Harry fervently. \"I don’t know what we’d do without you.\" She beamed, but became solemn at once. \"What about Luna?\" \"Well, if they’re telling the truth and she’s still Alive ---\" began Ron. \"Don’t say that, don’t say it!\" squealed Hermione. \"She must be alive, she must!\" \"Then she’ll be in Azkaban, I expect,\" said Ron. \"Whether she survives the place, though...Loads don’t...\" \"She will,\" said Harry. He could not bear to contemplate the alternative. \"She’s tough, Luna, much tougher than you’d think. She’s probably teaching all the inmates about Wrackspurts and Nargles.\" \"I hope you’re right,\" said Hermione. She passed a hand over her eyes. \"I’d feel so sorry for Xenophilius if ---\" \"---if he hadn’t just tried to sell us to the Death Eaters, yeah,\" said Ron. They put up the tent and retreated inside it, where Ron made them tea. After their narrow escape, the chilly, musty old place felt like home: safe, familiar, and friendly. \"Oh, why did we go there?\" groaned Hermione after a few minutes’ silence. \"Harry, you were right, it was Godric’s Hollow all over again, a complete waste of time! The Deathly Hallows...such rubbish...although actually,\" a sudden thought seemed to have struck her, \"he might have made it all up, mightn’t he? He probably doesn’t believe in the Deathly Hallows at all, he just wanted to keep us talking until the Death Eaters arrived!\" \"I don’t think so,\" said Ron. \"It’s a damn sight harder making stuff up when you’re under stress than you’d think. I found that out when the Snatchers caught me. It was much easier pretending to be Stan, because I knew a bit about him, than inventing a whole new person. Old Lovegood was under loads of pressure, trying to make sure we stayed put. I reckon he told us the truth, or what he thinks is the truth, just to keep us talking.\" \"Well, I don’t suppose it matters,\" sighed Hermione. \"Even if he was being honest, I never heard such a lot of nonsense in all my life.\" \"Hang on, though,\" said Ron. \"The Chamber of Secrets was supposed to be a myth, wasn’t it?\" \"But the Deathly Hallows can’t exist, Ron!\" \"You keep saying that, but one of them can,\" said Ron. \"Harry’s Invisibility Cloak ---\" \"The Tale of the Three Brothers’ is a story,\" said Hermione firmly. \"A story about how humans are frightened of death. If surviving was as simple as hiding under the Invisibility Cloak, we’d have everything we need already!\" \"I don’t know. We could do with an unbeatable wand,\" said Harry, turning the blackthorn wand he so disliked over in his fingers. \"There’s no such thing, Harry!\" \"You said there have been loads of wands --- the Deathstick and whatever they were called ---\" \"All right, even if you want to kid yourself the Elder Wand’s real, what about the Resurrection Stone?\" Her fingers sketched quotation marks around the name, and her tone dripped sarcasm. \"No magic can raise the dead, and that’s that!\" \"When my wand connected with You-Know-Who’s, it made my mum and dad appear...and Cedric...\" \"But they weren’t really back from the dead, were they?\" said Hermione. \"Those kind of ---of pale imitations aren’t the same as truly bringing someone back to life.\" \"But she, the girl in the tale, didn’t really come back, did she? The story says that once people are dead, they belong with the dead. But the second brother still got to see her and talk to her, didn’t he? He even lived with her for a while...\" He saw concern and something less easily definable in Hermione’s expression. Then, as she glanced at Ron, Harry realized that it was fear: He had scared her with his talk of living with dead people. \"So that Peverell bloke who’s buried in Godric’s Hollow,\" he said hastily, trying to sound robustly sane, \"you don’t know anything about him, then?\" \"No,\" she replied, looking relieved at the change of subject. \"I looked him up after I saw the mark on his grave; if he’d been anyone famous or done anything important, I’m sure he’d be in one of our books. The only place I’ve managed to find the name ‘Peverell’ Is Nature’s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. I borrowed it from Kreacher,\" she explained as Ron raised his eyebrows. \"It lists the pure-blood families that are now extinct in the male line. Apparently the Peverells were one of the earliest families to vanish.\" \"Extinct in the male line?\" repeated Ron. \"It means the name died out,\" said Hermione, \"centuries ago, in the case of the Peverells. They could still have descendents, though, they’d just be called something different.\" And then it came to Harry in one shining piece, the memory that had stirred at the sound of the name \"Peverell\": a filthy old man brandishing an ugly ring in the face of a Ministry official, and he cried aloud, \"Marvolo Gaunt!\" \"Sorry said Ron and Hermione together. \"Marvolo Gaunt! You-Know-Who’s grandfather! In the Pensieve! With Dumbledore! Marvolo Gaunt said he was descended from the Peverells!\" Ron and Hermione looked bewildered. \"The ring, the ring that became the Horcrux, Marvolo Gaunt said it had the Peverell coat of arms on it! I saw him waving it in the bloke from the Ministry’s face, he nearly shoved it up his nose!\" \"The Peverell coat of arms?\" said Hermione sharply. \"Could you see what it looked like?\" \"Not really,\" said Harry, trying to remember. \"There was nothing fancy on there, as far as I could see; maybe a few scratches. I only ever saw it really close up after it had been cracked open.\" Harry saw Hermione’s comprehension in the sudden widening of her eyes. Ron was looking from one to the other, astonished. \"Blimey...You reckon it was this sign again? The sign of the Hallows? \"Why not said Harry excitedly, \"Marvolo Gaunt was an ignorant old git who lived like a pig, all he cared about was his ancestry. If that ring had been passed down through the centuries, he might not have known what it really was. There were no books in that house, and trust me, he wasn’t the type to read fairy tales to his kids. He’d have loved to think the scratches on the stone were a coat of arms, because as far as he was concerned, having pure blood made you practically royal.\" \"Yes...and that’s all very interesting,\" said Hermione cautiously, \"but Harry, if you’re thinking what I think you’re think ---\" \"Well, why not? Why not? said Harry, abandoning caution. \"It was a stone, wasn’t it?\" He looked at Ron for support. \"What if it was the Resurrection Stone?\" Ron’s mouth fell open. \"Blimey --- but would it still work if Dumbledore broke --- ?\" \"Work? Work? Ron, it never worked! There’s no such thing as a Resurrection Stone!\" Hermione leapt to her feet, looking exasperated and angry. Harry you’re trying to fit everything into the Hallows story ---\" \"Fit everything in?\" he repeated. \"Hermione, it fits of its own accord! I know the sign of the Deathly Hallows was on that stone! Gaunt said he was descended from the Peverells!\" \"A minute ago you told us you never saw the mark on the stone properly!\" \"Where’d you reckon the ring is now?\" Ron asked Harry. \"What did Dumbledore do with it after he broke it open?\" \"But Harry’s imagination was racing ahead, far beyond Ron and Hermione’s... Three objects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make the possessor master of Death...Master...Conqueror...Vanquisher...The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death... And he saw himself, possessor of the Hallows, facing Voldemort, whose Horcruxes were no match...Neither can live while the other survives...Was this the answer? Hallows versus Horcruxes? Was there a way after all, to ensure that he was the one who triumphed? If he were the master of the Deathly Hallows, would he be safe? \"Harry?\" But he scarcely heard Hermione: He had pulled out his Invisibility Cloak and was running it through his fingers, the cloth supple as water, light as air. He had never seen anything to equal it in his nearly seven years in the Wizarding world. The Cloak was exactly what Xenophilius had described: A cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible, and endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable concealment, no matter what spells are cast at it... And then, with a gasp, he remembered- \"Dumbledore had my Cloak the night my parents died!\" His voice shook and he could feel the color in his face, but he did not care. \"My mum told Sirius that Dumbledore borrowed the Cloak! This is why! He wanted to examine it, because he thought it was the third Hallow! Ignotus Peverell is buried in Godric’s Hollow...\" Harry was walking blindly around the tent, feeling as though great new vistas of truth were opening all around him. \"He’s my ancestor. I’m descended from the third brother! It all makes sense!\" \"He felt armed in certainty, in his belief in the Hallows, as if the mere idea of possessing them was giving him protection, and he felt joyous as he turned back to the other two. \"Harry,\" said Hermione again, but he was busy undoing the pouch around his neck, his fingers shaking hard. \"Read it,\" he told her, pushing his mother’s letter into her hand. \"Read it! Dumbledore had the Cloak, Hermione! Why else would he want it? He didn’t need a Cloak, he could perform a Disillusionment Charm so powerful that he made himself completely invisible without one!\" Something fell to the floor and rolled, glittering, under a chair: He had dislodged the Snitch when he pulled out the letter. He stooped to pick it up, and then the newly tapped spring of fabulous discoveries threw him another gift, and shock and wonder erupted inside him so that he shouted out. \"IT’S IN HERE! He left me the ring - it’s in the Snitch!\" \"You --- you reckon?\" He could not understand why Ron looked taken aback. It was so obvious, so clear to Harry. Everything fit, everything...His Cloak was the third Hallow, and when he discovered how to open the Snitch he would have the second, and then all he needed to do was find the first Hallow, the Elder Wand, and then --- But it was as though a curtain fell on a lit stage: All his excitement, all his hope and happiness were extinguished at a stroke, and he stood alone in the darkness, and the glorious spell was broken. \"That’s what he’s after.\" The change in his voice made Ron and Hermione look even more scared. \"You-Know-Who’s after the Elder Wand.\" He turned his back on their strained, incredulous faces. He knew it was the truth. It all made sense, Voldemort was not seeking a new wand; he was seeking an old wand, a very old wand indeed. Harry walked to the entrance of the tent, forgetting about Ron and Hermione as he looked out into the night, thinking... Voldemort had been raised in a Muggle orphanage. Nobody could have told him The Tales of Beedle the Bard when he was a child, any more than Harry had heard them. Hardly any wizards believed in the Deathly Hallows. Was it likely that Voldemort knew about them? Harry gazed into the darkness...If Voldemort had known about the Deathly Hallows, surely he would have sought them, done anything to possess them: three objects that made the possessor master of Death? If he had known about the Deathly Hallows, he might not have needed Horcruxes in the first place. Didn’t the simple fact that he had taken a Hallow, and turned it into a Horcrux, demonstrate that he did not know this last great Wizarding secret? Which meant that Voldemort sought the Elder Wand without realizing its full power, without understanding that it was one of three...for the wand was the Hallow that could not be hidden, whose existence was best known...The bloody trail of the Elder Wand is splattered across the pages of Wizarding history... Harry watched the cloudy sky, curves of smoke-gray and silver sliding over the face of the white moon. He felt lightheaded with amazement at his discoveries. He turned back into the tent. It was a shock to see Ron and Hermione standing exactly where he had left them, Hermione still holding Lily’s letter, Ron at her side looking slightly anxious. Didn’t they realize how far they had traveled in the last few minutes? \"This is it?\" Harry said, trying to bring them inside the glow of his own astonished certainty, \"This explains everything. The Deathly Hallows are real and I’ve got one --- maybe two ---\" He held up the Snitch. \"--- and You-Know-Who’s chasing the third, but he doesn’t realize...he just thinks it’s a powerful wand ---\" \"Harry,\" said Hermione, moving across to him and handing him back Lily’s letter, \"I’m sorry, but I think you’ve got this wrong, all wrong.\" \"But don’t you see? It all fits ---\" \"Not, it doesn’t,\" she said. \"It doesn’t. Harry, you’re just getting carried away. Please,\" she said as she started to speak, \"please just answer me this: If the Deathly Hallows really existed, and Dumbledore knew about them, knew that the person who possessed all of them would be master of Death --- Harry, why wouldn’t he have told you? Why?\" He had his answer ready. \"But you said it, Hermione! You’ve got to find out about them for yourself! It’s a Quest!\" \"But I only said that to try and persuade you to come to the Lovegoods’!\" cried Hermione in exasperation. \"I didn’t really believe it!\" Harry took no notice. \"Dumbledore usually let me find out stuff for myself. He let me try my strength, take risks. This feels like the kind of thing he’d do.\" \"Harry, this isn’t a game, this isn’t practice! This is the real thing, and Dumbledore left you very clear instructions: Find and destroy the Horcruxes! That symbol doesn’t mean anything, forget the Deathly Hallows, we can’t afford to get sidetracked ---\" Harry was barely listening to her. He was turning the Snitch over and over in his hands, half expecting it to break open, to reveal the Resurrection Stone, to prove to Hermione that he was right, that the Deathly Hallows were real. She appealed to Ron. \"You don’t believe in this, do you?\" Harry looked up, Ron hesitated. \"I dunno...I mean...bits of it sort of fit together,\" said Ron awkwardly, \"But when you look at the whole thing...\" He took a deep breath. \"I think we’re supposed to get rid of Horcruxes, Harry. That’s what Dumbledore told us to do. Maybe...maybe we should forget about this Hallows business.\" \"Thank you, Ron,\" said Hermione. \"I’ll take first watch.\" And she strode past Harry and sat down in the tent entrance bringing the action to a fierce full stop. But Harry hardly slept that night. The idea of the Deathly Hallows had taken possession of him, and he could not rest while agitating thoughts whirled through his mind: the wand, the stone, and the Cloak, if he could just possess them all... I open at the close...But what was the close? Why couldn’t he have the stone now? If only he had the stone, he could ask Dumbledore these questions in person...and Harry murmured words to the Snitch in the darkness, trying everything, even Parseltongue, but the golden ball would not open... And the wand, the Elder Wand, where was that hidden? Where was Voldemort searching now? Harry wished his scar would burn and show him Voldemort’s thoughts, because for the first time ever, he and Voldemort were united in wanting the very same thing...Hermione would not like that idea, of course...But then, she did not believe....Xenophilius had been right, in a way...Limited, Narrow, Close-minded. The truth was that she was scared of the idea of the Deathly Hallows, especially of the Resurrection Stone...and Harry pressed his mouth again to the Snitch, kissing it, nearly swallowing it, but the cold medal did not yield... It was nearly dawn when he remembered Luna, alone in a cell in Azkaban, surrounded by dementors, and he suddenly felt ashamed of himself. He had forgotten all about her in his feverish contemplation of the Hallows. If only they could rescue her, but dementors in those numbers would be virtually unassailable. Now he came to think about it, he had not tried casting a Patronus with the blackthorn wand...He must try that in the morning... If only there was a way of getting a better wand... And desire for the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, unbeatable, invincible, swallowed him once more... They packed up the tent next morning and moved on through a dreary shower of rain. The downpour pursued them to the coast, where they pitched the tent that night, and persisted through the whole week, through sodden landscapes that Harry found bleak and depressing. He could think only of the Deathly Hallows. It was as though a flame had been lit inside him that nothing, not Hermione’s flat disbelief nor Ron’s persistent doubts, could extinguish. And yet the fiercer the longing for the Hallows burned inside him, the less joyful it made him. He blamed Ron and Hermione: Their determined indifference was as bad as the relentless rain for dampening his spirits, but neither could erode his certainty, which remained absolute. Harry’s belief in and longing for the Hallows consumed him so much that he felt isolated from the other two and their obsession with the Horcruxes. \"Obsession?\" said Hermione in a low fierce voice, when Harry was careless enough to use the word one evening, after Hermione had told him off for his lack of interest in locating more Horcruxes. \"We’re not the one with an obsession, Harry! We’re the ones trying to do what Dumbledore wanted us to do!\" But he was impervious to the veiled criticism. Dumbledore had left the sign of the Hallows for Hermione to decipher, and he had also, Harry remained convinced of it, left the Resurrection Stone hidden in the golden Snitch. Neither can live while the other survives...master of Death...Why didn’t Ron and Hermione understand? \"’The last enemy shall be destroyed is death,’\" Harry quoted calmly. \"I thought it was You-Know-Who we were supposed to be fighting?\" Hermione retorted, and Harry gave up on her. Even the mystery of the silver doe, which the other two insisted on discussing, seemed less important to Harry now, a vaguely interesting sideshow. The only other thing that mattered to him was that his scar had begun to prickle again, although he did all he could to hide this fact from the other two. He sought solitude whenever it happened, but was disappointed by what he saw. The visions he and Voldemort were sharing had changed in quality; they had become blurred, shifting as though they were moving in and out of focus. Harry was just able to make out the indistinct features of an object that looked like a skull, and something like a mountain that was more shadow than substance. Used to images sharp as reality, Harry was disconcerted by the change. He was worried that the connection between himself and Voldemort had been damaged, a connection that he both feared and, whatever he had told Hermione, prized. Somehow Harry connected these unsatisfying, vague images with the destruction of his wand, as if it was the blackthorn wand’s fault that he could no longer see into Voldemort’s mind as well as before. As the weeks crept on, Harry could not help but notice, even through his new self-absorption, that Ron seemed to be taking charge. Perhaps because he was determined to make up for having walked out on them, perhaps because Harry’s descent into listlessness galvanized his dormant leadership qualities, Ron was the one now encouraging and exhorting the other two into action. \"Three Horcruxes left,\" he kept saying. \"We need a plan of action, come on! Where haven’t we looked? Let’s go through it again. The orphanage...\" Diagon Alley, Hogwarts, the Riddle House, Borgin and Burkes, Albania, every place that they knew Tom Riddle had ever lived or worked, visited or murdered, Ron and Hermione raked over them again, Harry joining in only to stop Hermione pestering him. He would have been happy to sit alone in silence, trying to read Voldemort’s thoughts, to find out more about the Elder Wand, but Ron insisted on journeying to ever more unlikely places simply, Harry was aware, to keep them moving. \"You never know,\" was Ron’s constant refrain. \"Upper Flagley is a Wizarding village, he might’ve wanted to live there. Let’s go and have a poke around.\" These frequent forays into Wizarding territory brought them within occasional sight of Snatchers. \"Some of them are supposed to be as bad as Death Eaters,\" said Ron. \"The lot that got me were a bit pathetic, but Bill recons some of them are really dangerous. They said on Potterwatch ---\" \"On what?\" said Harry. \"Potterwatch, didn’t I tell you that’s what it was called? The program I keep trying to get on the radio, the only one that tells the truth about what’s going on! Nearly all of the programs are following You-Know-Who’s line, all except Potterwatch, I really want you to hear it, but it’s tricky tuning in...\" Ron spent evening after evening using his wand to beat out various rhythms on top of the wireless while the dials whirled. Occasionally they would catch snatches of advice on how to treat dragonpox, and once a few bars of \"A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love.\" While he taped, Ron continued to try to hit on the correct password, muttering strings of random words under his breath. \"They’re normally something to do with the Order,\" he told them. \"Bill had a real knack for guessing them. I’m bound to get one in the end...\" \"But not until March did luck favor Ron at last. Harry was sitting in the tent entrance, on guard duty, staring idly at a clump of grape hyacinths that had forced their way through the chilly ground, when Ron shouted excitedly from inside the tent. \"I’ve got it, I’ve got it! Password was ‘Albus’! Get in here, Harry.\" Roused for the first time in days from his contemplation of the Deathly Hallows, Harry hurried back inside the tent to find Ron and Hermione kneeling on the floor beside the little radio. Hermione, who had been polishing the sword of Gryffindor just for something to do, was sitting open-mouthed, staring at the tiny speaker, from which a most familiar voice was issuing. \"...apologize for our temporary absence from the airwaves, which was due to a number of house calls in our area by those charming Death Eaters.\" \"But that’s Lee Jordan!\" said Hermione. \"I know!\" beamed Ron. \"Cool, eh?\" \"...now found ourselves another secure location,\" Lee was saying, and I’m pleased to tell you that two of our regular contributors have joined me here this evening. Evening, boys!\" \"Hi.\" \"Evening, River.\" \"’River’\" that’s Lee,\" Ron explained. \"They’ve all got code names, but you can usually tell ---\" \"Shh!\" said Hermione. \"But before we hear from Royal and Romulus,\" Lee went on, \"let’s take a moment to report those deaths that the Wizarding Wireless Network News and Daily Prophet don’t think important enough to mention. It is with great regret that we inform our listeners of the murders of Ted Tonks and Dirk Cresswell.\" Harry felt a sick, swooping in his belly. He, Ron, and Hermione gazed at one another in horror. \"A goblin by the name of Gornuk was also killed. It is believed that Muggle-born Dean Thomas and a second goblin, both believed to have been traveling with Tonks, Cresswell, and Gornuk, may have escaped. If Dean is listening, or if anyone has any knowledge of his whereabouts, his parents and sisters are desperate for news. \"Meanwhile, in Gaddley, a Muggle family of five has been found dead in their home. Muggle authorities are attributing their deaths to a gas leak, but members of the Order of the Phoenix inform me that it was the Killing Curse --- more evidence, as if it were needed, of the fact that Muggle slaughter is becoming little more than a recreational sport under the new regime. \"Finally, we regret to inform our listeners that the remains of Bathilda Bagshot have been discovered in Godric’s Hollow. The evidence is that she died several months ago. The Order of the Phoenix informs us that her body showed unmistakable signs of injuries inflicted by Dark Magic. \"Listeners, I’d like to invite you now to join us in a minute’s silence in memory of Ted Tonks, Dirk Cresswell, Bathilda Bagshot, Gornuk, and the unnamed, but no less regretted, Muggles murdered by the Death Eaters.\" Silence fell, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione did not speak. Half of Harry yearned to hear more, half of him was afraid of what might come next. It was the first time he had felt fully connected to the outside world for a long time. \"Thank you,\" said Lee’s voice. \"And now we can return to regular contributor Royal, for an update on how the new Wizarding order is affecting the Muggle world.\" \"Thanks, River,\" said an unmistakable voice, deep, measured, reassuring. \"Kingsley!\" burst out Ron. \"We know!\" said Hermione, hushing him. \"Muggles remain ignorant of the source of their suffering as they continue to sustain heavy casualties,\" said Kingsley. \"However, we continue to hear truly inspirational stories of wizards and witches risking their own safety to protect Muggle friends and neighbors, often without the Muggles’ knowledge. I’d like to appeal to all our listeners to emulate their example, perhaps by casting a protective charm over any Muggle dwellings in your street. Many lives could be saved if such simple measures are taken.\" \"And what would you say, Royal, to those listeners who reply that in these dangerous times, it should be ‘Wizards first’? asked Lee. \"I’d say that it’s one short step from ‘Wizards first’ to ‘Purebloods first,’ and then to ‘Death Eaters,’\" replied Kingsley. \"We’re all human, aren’t we? Every human life is worth the same, and worth saving.\" \"Excellently put, Royal, and you’ve got my vote for Minister of Magic if we ever get out of this mess,\" said Lee. \"And now, over to Romulus for our popular feature ‘Pals of Potter.’\" \"Thanks, River,\" said another very familiar voice. Ron started to speak, but Hermione forestalled him in a whisper. \"We know it’s Lupin!\" \"Romulus, do you maintain, as you have every time you’ve appeared on our program, that Harry Potter is still alive?\" \"I do,\" said Lupin firmly. \"There is no doubt at all in my mind that his death would be proclaimed as widely as possible by the Death Eaters if it had happened, because it would strike a deadly blow at the morale of those resisting the new regime. ‘The Boy Who Lived’ remains a symbol of everything for which we are fighting: the triumph of good, the power of innocence, the need to keep resisting.\" A mixture of gratitude and shame welled up in Harry. Had Lupin forgiven him, then, for the terrible things he had said when they had last met? \"And what would you say to Harry if you knew he was listening, Romulus?\" \"I’d tell him we’re all with him in spirit,\" said Lupin, then hesitated slightly, \"And I’d tell him to follow his instincts, which are good and nearly always right.\" Harry looked at Hermione, whose eyes were full of tears. \"Nearly always right,\" she repeated. \"Oh, didn’t I tell you?\" said Ron in surprise. \"Bill told me Lupin’s living with Tonks again! And apparently she’s getting pretty big too...\" \"...and our usual update on those friends of Harry Potter’s who are suffering for their allegiance?\" Lee was saying. \"Well, as regular listeners will know, several of the more outspoken supporters of Harry Potter have now been imprisoned, including Xenophilius Lovegood, erstwhile editor of The Quibbler,\" said Lupin. \"At least he’s still alive!\" muttered Ron. \"We have also heard within the last few hours that Rubeus Hagrid\" - all three of them gasped, and so nearly missed the rest of the sentence -- \"well-known gamekeeper at Hogwarts School, has narrowly escaped arrest within the grounds of Hogwarts, where he is rumored to have hosted a ‘Support Harry Potter’ party in his house. However, Hagrid was not taken into custody, and is, we believe, on the run.\" \"I suppose it helps, when escaping from Death Eaters, if you’ve got a sixteen-foot-high half brother?\" asked Lee. \"It would tend to give you an edge,\" agreed Lupin gravely. \"May I just add that while we here at Potterwatch applaud Hagrid’s spirit, we would urge even the most devoted of Harry’s supporters against following Hagrid’s lead. ‘Support Harry Potter’ parties are unwise in the present climate.\" \"Indeed they are, Romulus,\" said Lee, \"so we suggest that you continue to show your devotion to the man with the lightning scar by listening to Potterwatch! And now let’s move to news concerning the wizard who is proving just as elusive as Harry Potter. We like to refer to him as the Chief Death Eater, and here to give his views on some of the more insane rumors circulating about him, I’d like to introduce a new correspondent. Rodent?\" \"’Rodent’?\" said yet another familiar voice, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione cried out together: \"Fred!\" \"No - is it George?\" \"It’s Fred, I think,\" said Ron, leaning in closer, as whichever twin it was said, \"I’m not being ‘Rodent,’ no way, I told you I wanted to be ‘Rapier’!\" \"Oh, all right then, ‘Rapier,’ could you please give us your take on the various stories we’ve been hearing about the Chief Death Eater?\" \"Yes, River, I can,\" said Fred. \"As our listeners will know, unless they’ve taken refuge at the bottom of a garden pond or somewhere similar, You-Know-Who’s strategy of remaining in the shadows is creating a nice little climate of panic. Mind you, if all the alleged sightings of him are genuine, we must have a good nineteen You-Know-Whos running around the place.\" \"Which suits him, of course,\" said Kingsley. \"The air of mystery is creating more terror than actually showing himself.\" \"Agreed,\" said Fred. \"So, people, let’s try and calm down a bit. Things are bad enough without inventing stuff as well. For instance, this new idea that You-Know-Who can kill people with a single glance from his eyes. That’s a basilisk, listeners. One simple test: Check whether the thing that’s glaring at you has got legs. If it has, it’s safe to look into its eyes, although if it really is You-Know-Who, that’s still likely to be the last thing you ever do.\" For the first time in weeks and weeks, Harry was laughing: He could feel the weight of tension leaving him. \"And the rumors that he keeps being sighted abroad?\" asked Lee. \"Well, who wouldn’t want a nice little holiday after all the hard work he’s been putting in?\" asked Fred. \"Point is, people, don’t get lulled into a false sense of security, thinking he’s out of the country. Maybe he is, maybe he isn’t, but the fact remains he can move faster than Severus Snape confronted with shampoo when he wants to, so don’t count on him being a long way away if you’re planning to take any risks. I never thought I’d hear myself say it, but safety first!\" \"Thank you very much for those wise words, Rapier,\" said Lee. \"Listeners, that brings us to the end of another Potterwatch. We don’t know when it will be possible to broadcast again, but you can be sure we shall be back. Keep twiddling those dials: The next password will be ‘Mad-Eye.’ Keep each other safe: Keep faith. Good night.\" The radio’s dial twirled and the lights behind the tuning panel went out. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were still beaming. Hearing familiar, friendly voices was an extraordinary tonic; Harry had become so used to their isolation he had nearly forgotten that other people were resisting Voldemort. It was like waking from a long sleep. \"Good, eh?\" said Ron happily. \"Brilliant,\" said Harry. \"It’s so brave of them,\" sighed Hermione admiringly. \"If they were found ...\" \"Well, they keep on the move, don’t they?\" said Ron. \"Like us.\" \"But did you hear what Fred said?\" asked Harry excitedly; now the broadcast was over, his thoughts turned around toward his all consuming obsession. \"He’s abroad! He’s still looking for the Wand, I knew it!\" \"Harry-\" \"Come on, Hermione, why are you so determined not to admit it? Vol -\" \"HARRY, NO!\" \"-demort’s after the Elder Wand!\" \"The name’s Taboo!\" Ron bellowed, leaping to his feet as a loud crack sounded outside the tent. \"I told you, Harry, I told you, we can’t say it anymore - we’ve got to put the protection back around us - quickly - it’s how they find -\" But Ron stopped talking, and Harry knew why. The Sneakoscope on the table had lit up and begun to spin; they could hear voices coming nearer and nearer: rough, excited voices. Ron pulled the Deluminator out of his pocket and clicked it: Their lamps went out. \"Come out of there with your hands up!\" came a rasping voice through the darkness. \"We know you’re in there! You’ve got half a dozen wands pointing at you and we don’t care who we curse!\" \n",

            "-Two The Elder Wand The world had ended, so why had the battle not ceased, the castle fallen silent in horror, and every combatant laid down their arms? Harry's mind was in free fall, spinning out of control, unable to grasp the impossibility, because Fred Weasley could not be dead, the evidence of all his senses must be lying-- And then a body fell past the hole blown into the side of the school and curses flew in at them from the darkness, hitting the wall behind their heads. \"Get down!\" Harry shouted, as more curses flew through the night: He and Ron had both grabbed Hermione and pulled her to the floor, but Percy lay across Fred's body, shielding it from further harrm, and when Harry shouted \"Percy, come on, we've got to move!\" he shook his head. \"Percy!\" Harry saw tear tracks streaking the grime coating ron's face as he sezied his elder brother's shoulders and pulled, but Percy would not budge. \"Percy, you can't do anything for him! We're going to--\" Hermione screamed, and Harry, turning, did not need to ask why. A monstrous spider the size of a small car was trying to climb through the huge hole in the wall. one of Aragog's descendants had joined the fight. Ron and Harry shouted together; their spells collided and the monster was blown backward, its legs jerking horribly, and vanished into the darkness. \"It brought friends!\" Harry called to the others, glancing over the edge of the castle through the hole in the wall the curses had blasted. More giant spiders were climbing the side of the building, liberated from the Forbidden Forest, into which the Death Eaters must have penetrated. Harry fired Stunning Spells down upon them, knocking the lead monster into its fellows, so that they rolled back down the building and out of sight. Then more curses came soaring over Harry's head, so close he felt the force of them blow his hair. \"Let's move, NOW!\" Pushing Hermione ahead of him with ron, Harry stooped to seize Fred's body under the armpit. Percy, realizing what Harry was trying to do, stopped clinging to the body and helped: together, crouching low to avoid the curses flying at them from the grounds, they hauled Fred out of the way. \"Here,\" said Harry, and they placed him in a niche where a suit of armor had stood earlier. He could not bear to look at Fred a second longer than he had to, and after making sure that the body was well- hidden, he took off after ron and Hermione. Malfoy and Goyle had vanished but at the end of the corridor, which was now full of dust and falling masonry, glass long gone from windows, he saw many people running backward and forward, whether friends or foes he could not tell. Rounding the corner, Percy let out a bull-like roar: \"ROOKWOOD!\" and sprinted off in the direction of a tall man, who was pursuing a couple of students. \"Harry, in here!\" Hermione screamed. She had pulled Ron behind a tapestry. They seemed to be wrestling together, and for one mad second Harry thought that they were embracing again; then hhe saw that Hermione was trying to restrain Ron, to stop him running after Percy. \"Listen to me--LISTEN RON!\" \"I wanna help--I wanna kill Death Eaters--\" His face was contorted, smeared with dust and smoke, and he was shaking with rage and grief. \"ron, we're the only ones who can end it! Please--ron--we need the snake, we've got to kill the snake!\" said Hermione. But Harry knew how Ron felt: Pursuing another Horcrux could not bring the satisfaction of revenge; he too wanted to fight, to punish them, the people who had killed Fred, and he wanted to find the other Weasleys, and above all make sure, make quite sure, that Ginny was not--but he could not permit that idea to form in his mind-- \"We will fight!\" Hermione said. \"We'll have to, to reach the snake! But let's not lose sight now of what we're supposed to be d-doing! We're the only ones who can end it!\" She was crying too, and she wiped her face on her torn and singed sleeve as she spoke, but she took great heaving breaths to calm herself as, still keeping a tight hold on ron, she turned to Harry. \"You need to find out where Voldemort is, because he'll have the snake with him, won't he? Do it, Harry--look inside him!\" Why was it so easy? Because his scar had been burning for hours, yearning to show him Voldemort's thoughts? He closed his eyes on her command, and at once, the screams and bangs and all the discordant sounds of the battle were drowned until they became distant, as though he stood far, far away from them... He was standing in the middle of a desolate but strangely familiar room, with peeling paper on the walls and all the windows boarded up except for one. The sounds of the assault on the castle were muffled and distant. The single unblocked window revealed distant bursts of light where the castle stood, but inside the room was dark except for a solitary oil lamp. He was rolling his wand between his figners, watching it, his thoughts on the room in the castle, the secret room only he had ever found, the room, like the chamber, that you had to be clever and cunning and inquisitive to discover...He was confident that the boy would not find the diadem...although Dumbledore's puppet had come much farther than he ever expected...too far... \"My Lord,\" said a voice, desperate and cracked. He turned: there was Lucius Malfoy sitting in the darkest corner, ragged and still bearing the marks of the punishment he had received after the boy's last escape. One of his eyes remained closed and puffy. \"My Lord...please...my son...\" \"If your son is dead, Lucius, it is not my fault. He did not come and join me, like the rest of the Slytherins. Perhaps he has decided to befriend Harry Potter?\" \"No--never,\" whispered Malfoy. \"You must hope not.\" \"Aren't--aren't you afraid, my Lord that Potter might die at another hand but yours?\" asked Malfoy, his voice shaking. \"Wouldn't it be...forgive me...more prudent to call off this battle, enter the castle, and seek him y-yourself?\" \"Do not pretend Lucius. You wish the battle to cease so that you can discover what has happened to your son. And i do not need to seek Potter. Before the night is out, Potter will have come to find me.\" Voldemort dropped his gaze once more to the wand in his fingers. It troubled him...and those things that troubled Lord Voldemort needed to be rearranged... \"Go and fetch Snape.\" \"Snape, m-my Lord?\" \"Snape. Now. I need him. There is a --service--I require from him. Go.\" Frightened, stumbling a little through the gloom, Lucius left the room. Vodlemort continued to stand there, twirling the wand between his fingers, staring at it. \"It is the only way, Nagini,\" he whispered, and he looked around, and there was the great thick snake, now suspended in midair, twisting gracefully within the enchanted, protected space he had made for her, a starry, transparent sphere somewhere between a glittering cage and a tank. With a gasp, Harry pulled back and opened his yees at the same moment his ears were assaulted with the screeches and cries, the smashes and bangs of battle. \"He's in the Shrieking Shack. The snake's with him, it's got some sort of magical protection around it. He's just sent Lucius Malfoy to find Snape.\" \"voldemort's sitting in the shrieking Shack?\" said Hermione, outraged. \"He's not--he's not even FIGHTING?\" \"He doesn't think he needs to fight,\" said Harry. \"He thinks I'm going to go to him.\" \"But why?\" \"He knows I'm after Horcruxes--he's keeping Nagini close beside him- -obviously I'm going to have to go to him to get near the thing--\" \"Right,\" said Ron, squaring his shoulders. \"So you can't go, that's what he wants, what he's expecting. You stay here and look after Hermione, and I'll go and get it--\" Harry cut across Ron. \"You two stay here, I'll go under the Cloak and I'll be back as soon as I--\" \"No,\" said Hermione,, \"it makes much more sense if I take the Cloak and--\" \"Don't even think about it,\" Ron snarled at her. before Hermione could get farther than \"Ron, I'm just as capable -- \" the tapestry at the top of the staircase on which they stood was ripped open. \"POTTER!\" Two masked Death Eaters stood there, but even before their wands were fully raised, Hermione shouted \"Glisseo!\" The stairs beneath their feet flatteneed into a chute and she, Harry, and Ron hurtled down it, unable to control their speed but so fast that the Death Eaters' Stunning Spells flew far over their heads. They shot through the concealing tapestry at the bottom and spun onto the floor, hitting the opposite wall. \"Duro!\" cried Hermione, pointing her wand at the tapestry, and there were two loud, sickening crunches as the tapestry turned to stone and the Death Eaters pursuing them crumpled against it. \"Get back!\" shouted Ron, and he, Harry, and Hermione hurled themselves against a door as a herd of galloping desks thundered past, shepherdd by a sprinting Professor McGonagall. She appeared not to notice them. Her hair had come down and there was a gash on her cheek. As she turned the corner, they heard her scream, \"CHARGE!\" \"Harry, you get the Cloak on,\" said Hermione. \"Never mind us--\" But he threw it over all three of them; large though they were he doubted anyone would see their disembodied feet through the dust that clogged the air, the falling stone, the shimmer of spells. they ran down the next staircase and found themselves in a corridor full of duelers. The portraits on either side of the fighters were crammed with figures screaming advice and encouragement, while Death Eaters, both masked and unmasked, dueled students and teachers. Dean had won himself a wand, for he was face-to-face with Dolohov, Parvati with Travers. Harry, ron and Hermione raised their wands at once, ready to strike, but the duelers were weaving and darting so much that there was a strong likelihood of hurting on of their own side if they cast curses. Even as they stood braced, looking for the opportunity to act, there came a great \"Wheeeeee!\" and looking up, Harry saw Peeves zoomign over them, dropping Snargaluff pods down onto the Death Eaters, whose heads were suddenly engulfed in wriggling green tubers like fat worms. \"ARGH!\" A fistful of tubers had hit the Cloak over Ron's head; the damp green roots were suspended improbably in midair as Ron tried to shake them loose. \"Someone's invisible there!\" shouted a masked Death Eater, pointing. Dean made the most of the Death Eater's momentary distraction, knocking him out with a stunning Spell; Dolohov attempted to retaliate, and Parvati shot a Body Bind Curse at him. \"LET'S GO!\" Harry yelled, and he, Ron, and Hermione gathered the Cloak tightly around themselves and pelted, heads down, through the midst of the fighters, slipping a little in pools of Snargaluff juice, toward the top of the marble staircase into the entrance hall. \"I'm Draco Malfoy, I'm Draco, I'm on your side!\" Draco was on the upper landing, pleading with anoter masked Death Eater. Harry Stunned the Death Eater as they passed. Malfoy looked around, beaming, for his savior, and Ron punched him from under the Cloak. Malfoy fell backward on top of the Death Eater, his mouth bleeding, utterly bemused. \"And that's the second time we've saved your life tonight, you two- faced bastard!\" Ron yelled. There were more duelers all over the stairs and in the hall. Death Eaters everywhere Harry looked: Yaxley, close to the front doors, in combat with Flitwick, a masked Death Eater dueling Kingsley right beside them. Students ran in every direction; some carrying or dragging injured friends. Harry directed a Stunnning Spell toward the masked Death Eater; it missed but nearly hit Neville, who had emerged from nowhere brandishing armfuls of Venomous Tentacula, which looped itself happily around the nearest Death Eater and began reeling him in. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sped won the marble staircase: glass shattered on the left, and the Slytherin hourglass that had recorded House points spilled its emeralds everywhere, so that people slipped and staggered as they ran. Two bodies fell from the balcony overhead as they reached the ground a gray blur that Harry took for an animal sped four-legged across the hall to sink its teeth into one of the fallen. \"NO!\" shrieked Hermione, and with a deafening blast from her wand, Fenrir Greyback was thrown backward from the feebly struggling body of Lavender Brown. He hit the marble banisters and struggled to return to his feet. Then, with a bright white flash and a crack, a crystal ball fell on top of his head, and he crumpled to the ground and did not move. \"I have more!\" shrieked Professor Trelawney from over the banisters. \"More for any who want them! Here--\" And with a move likea tennis serve, she heaved another enormous crystal sphere from her bag, waved her wand through the air, and caused the ball to speed across the hall and smash through a window. At the same moment, the heavy wooden front doors burst open, and more of the gigantic spiders forced their way into the front hall. Screams of terror rent the air: the fighters scattered, Death Eaters and Hogwartians alike, and red and green jets of light flew into the midst of the oncoming monsters, which shuddered and reared, more terrifying than ever. \"How do we get out?\" yelled ron over all the screaming, but before either Harry or Hermione could answer they were bowled aside; Hagrid had come thundering down the stairs, brandishing his flowery pink umbrella. \"Don't hurt 'em, don't hurt 'em!\" he yelled. \"HAGRID, NO!\" Harry forgot everything else: he sprinted out from under the cloak, running bent double to avoid the curses illuminating the whole hall. \"HAGRID, COME BACK!\" But he was not even halfway to Hagrid when he saw it happen: Hagrid vanished amongst the spiders, and with a great scurrying, a foul swarming movement, they retreated under the onslaught of spells, Hagrid buried in their midst. \"HAGRID!\" Harry heard someone calling his own name, whether friend or foe he did not care: He was springint down the front steps into the dark grounds, and the spiders were swarming away with their prey, and he could see nothing of Hagrid at all. \"HAGRID!\" He thought he could make out an enormous arm waving from the mdist of the spider swarm, but as he made to chase after them, his way was impeded by a monumental foot, which swung down out of the darkness and made the ground on which he stood shudder. He looked up: A giant stood before him, twenty feet high, its head ihidden in shadow, nothing but its treelike, hairy shins illuminated by light from the castle doors. With one brutal, fluid movement, it smashed a massive fist through an upper window, and glass rained down upon Harryk, forcing him back under the shelter of the doorway. \"Oh my--!\" shrieked Hermione, as she and ron caught up with Harry and gazed upward at the giant now trying to seize people through the window above. \"DON'T!\" ron yelled, grabbing Hermione's hand as she raised her wand. \"Stun him and he'll crush half the castle--\" \"HAGGER?\" Grawp came lurching around the corner of the castle; only dnow did Harry realzie that Grawp was, indeed, an undersized giant. The gargantuan monster trying to crush people on the upper floors turned around and let out a rorar. The stone steps tremebled as he stomped toward his smaller kin, and Grawp's lopsided mouth fell open, showing yellow, half brick-sized teeth; and then they launched themselves at each other with the savagery of lions. \"RUN!\" Harry roared; the ngiht was full of hideous yells and blows as the giants wrestled, and he seized Hermione's hand and tore down the steps into the grounds, Ron bringing up the rear. Harry had not lost hope of finding and saving Hagrid; he ran so fast that they were halfway toward the forest before they were brought up short again. The air around them had frozen: Harry's breath caught and solidified in his chest. Shapes moved out in the darkness, swirling figures of concentrated blackness, moving in a great wave towards the castles, their faces hooded and their breath rattling... ron and Hermione closed in beside him as the sounds of fighting behind them grew suddenly muted, deadened, because a silence only dementors could bring was falling thickly through the night, and Fred was gone, and Hagrid was suurely dying or already dead... \"come on, Harry!\" said Hermione's voice from a very long way away. \"Patronuses, Harry, come on!\" he raised his wand, but a dull hopelessness was spreading throughout him: How many more lay dead that he did not yet know about? He felt as though his soul had already half left his body.... \"HARRY, COME ON!\" screamed Hermione. A hundred dementors were advancing, gliding toward them, sucking their way closer to Harry's despair, which was like a promise of a feast... He saw Ron's silver terrier burst into the air, flicker feebly, and expire; he saw Hermione's otter twist in midair and fade, and his own wand trembled in his hand, and he almost welcomed the oncoming oblivion, the promise of nothing, of no feeling... And then a silver hare, a boar, and fox soared past Harry, Ron, and Hermione's heads: the dementors fell back before the creatures' approach. Three more people had arrived out of the darkness to stand beside them, their wands outstretched, continuing to cast Patronuses: Luna, Ernie, and Seamus. \"That's right,\" said Luna encouragingly, as if they were back in the Room of Requirement and this was simply spell practice for the D.A., \"That's right, Harry...come on think of something happy...\" 'something happy?\" he said, his voice cracked. \"We're all still here,\" she whispered, \"we;re still fighting. Come on, now....\" There was a silver spark, then a wavering light, and then, with the greatest effort it had ever cost him the stag burst from the end of Harry's wand. It cantered forward, and now the dementors scattered in earnest, and immediately the night was mild again, but the sounds of the surrounding battle were loud in his ears. \"Can't thank you enough,\" said ron shakily, turning to Luna, Ernie, and Seamus \"you just saved--\" With a roar and an earth-quaking tremor, another giant came lurching out of the darkness from the direction of the forest, brandishing a club taller than any of them. \"RUN!\" Harry shouted again, but the others needed no telling; They all scattered, and not a second too soon, for the next moment the creature's vast foot had fallen exactly where they had been standing. Harry looked round: ron and Hermione were following him, but the other three had vanished back into the battle. \"Let's get out of range!\" yelled Ron as the giant swung its club again and its bellows echoed through the night, across the grounds wehere bursts of red and green light continued to illuminate the darkness. \"The Whomping willow,\" said Harry, \"go!\" Somehow he walled it all up in his mind, crammed it into a small space into which he could not look now: thoughts of Fred and Hagrid, and his terror for all the people he loved, scattered in and outside the castle, must all wait, because they had to run, had to reach the snake and Voldemort, because that was, as Hermione said, the only way to end it-- He sprinted, half-believing he could outdistance death itself, ignoring the jets of light flying in the darkness all around him, and the sound of hte lake crashing like the sea, and the creaking of the Forbidden Forest though the night was windless; through grounds that seemed themselves to have risen in rebellion, he ran faster than he had ever moved in his life, and it was he who saw the great tree first, the Willow that protected the secret at its roots with whiplike, slashing branches. Panting and gasping, Harry slowed down, skirting the willow's swiping branches, peering through the darkness toward its tick trunk, trying to see the single knot in the bark of the old tree that would paralyze it. Ron and Hermione caught up, Hermione so out of breath that she could not speak. \"How--how're we going to get in?\" panted ron. \"I can--see the palce- -if we jsut had--Crookshanks again--\" \"Crookshanks?\" wheezed Hermione, bent double, clutching her chest. \"Are you a wizard, or what?\" \"Oh--right--yeah--\" Ron looked around, then directed his wand at a twig on the ground and said \"Winguardium Leviosa!\" The twig flew up from the gruond, spun through the air as if caught by a gust of wind, then zoomed directly at the trunk through the Willow's ominously swaying branches. It jabbed at a place near the roots, and at once, the writhing tree became still. \"Perfect!\" panted Hermione. \"Wait.\" For one teetering second, while the crashes and booms of the battle filled the air, Harry hesitated. Voldemort wanted him to do this, wanted him to come...Was he leading Ron and Hermione into a trap? But the reality seemed to close upon him, cruel and plain: the only way forward was to kill the snake, and the snake was where Voldemort was, and voldemort was at the end of this tunnel... \"Harry, we're coming, just get in there!\" said Ron, pushing him forward. Harry wriggled into the earthy passage hidden in the tree's roots. It was a much tighter squeeze than it had been the last time they had entered it. The tunnel was low-ceilinged: they had had to double up to move throuhgh it nearly four years previously; now there was nothing for it but to crawl. Harry went first, his wand illuminated, expecting at any moment to meet barriers, but none came. They moved in silence, Harry's gaze fixed upon the swinging beam of the wand held in his fist. At last, the tunnel began to slope upward and Harry saw a sliver of light ahead. Hermione tugged at his ankle. \"The Cloak!\" she whispered. \"Put the Cloak on!\" He groped behind him and she forced the bundle of slippery cloth into his free hand. With difficulty he dragged it over himself, murmered, \"Nox,\" extinguishing his wandlight, and continued on his hands and knees, as silently as possible, all his senses straining, expecting every second to be discovered, to hear a cold clear voice, see a flash of green light. and then he heard voices coming from the room directly ahead of them, only slightly muffled by the fact that the opening at the endo fht etuunnel had been blocked up by what looked like an old crate. Hardly daring to breathe, Harry edged right up tot he opening and peered through a tiny gap left between crate and wall. The room beyond was dimly lit, but he could see Nagini, swirlign and coiling like a serpent underwater, safe in her enchanted, starry sphere, which floated unsupported in midair. He could see the edge of a table, and a long-fingered white hand toying with a wand. Then Snape spoke, and Harry's heart lurched: Snape was inches away from where he crouched, hidden. \"...my Lord, their resistance is crumbling--\" \"--and it is doing so without your help,\" said Voldemort in his high, clear voice. \"Skilled wizard though you are, Severus, I do not think you will make much difference now. We are almost there...almost.\" \"Let me find the boy. Let me bring you Potter. I know I can find him, my Lord. Please.\" Snape strode past the gap, and Harry drew back a little, keeping his eyes fixed upon Nagini, wondering whether there was any spell that might penetrate the protection surrounding her, but he could not think of anything. One failed attempt, and he would give away his position... Voldemort stood up. Harry could see him now, see the red eyes, the flattened, serpentine face, the pallor of him gleaming slightly in the semidarkness. \"I have a problem, Severus,\" said Voldemort softly. \"My Lord?\" said Snape. Voldemort raised the Elder Wand, holding it as delicately and precisely as a conductor's baton. \"Why doesn't it work for me, Severus?\" In the silence Harry imagined he could hear the snake hissing slightly as it coiled and uncoiled--or was it Voldemort's sibilant sigh lingering on the air? \"My--my lord?\" said Snape blankly. \"I do not understand. You--you have performed extraordinary magic with that wand.\" \"No,\" said Voldemort. \"I have performed my usual magic. I am extraordinary, but this wand...no. It has not revealed the wonders it has promised. I feel no difference between this wand and the one I procured from Ollivander all those years ago.\" Voldemort's tone was musing, calm, but Harry's scar had begun to throb and pulse: Pain was building in his forehead, and he could feel that controlled sense of fury building inside Voldemort. \"No difference,\" said Voldemort again. Snape did not speak. Harry could not see his face. He wondered whether Snape sensed danger, was trying to find the right words to reassure his master. Voldemort started to move around the room: Harry lost sight of him for seconds as he prowled, speaking in that same measured voice, while the pain and fury mounted in Harry. \"I have thought long and hard, Severus...do you know why I have called you back from battle?\" And for a moment Harry saw Snape's profile. His eyes were fixed upon the coiling snake in its enchanted cage. \"No, my Lord, but I beg you will let me return. Let me find Potter.\" \"You sound like Lucius. Neither of you understands Potter as I do. He does not need finding. Potter will come to me. I knew his weakness you see, his one great flaw. He will hate watching the others struck down around him, knwoing that it is for him that it happens. He will want to stop it at any cost. He will come.\" \"But my Lord, he might be killed accidentally by someone other than yourself--\"\\ \"My instructions to the Death Eaters have been perfectly clear. Capture Potter. Kill his friends--the more, the better--but do not kill him. \"But it is of you that I wished to speak, Severus, not Harry Potter. You have been very valuable to me. Very valuable.\" \"My Lord knows I seek only to serve him. But--let me go and find the boy, my Lord. Let me bring him to you. I know I can--\" \"I have told you, no!\" said Voldemort, and Harry caught the lgint of red in his eyes as he turned again, and the swishing of his cloak was like the slithering of a snake, and he felt Voldemort's impatience in his burning scar. \"My concern at the moment, Severus, is what will happen when I finally meet the boy!\" \"My Lord, there can be no question, surely--?\" \"--but there is a question, Severus. There is.\" Voldemort halted, and Harry could see him plainly again as he slid the Elder Wand through his white fingers, staring at Snape. \"Why did both the wands I have used fail when directed at Harry Potter?\" \"I--I cannot answer that, my Lord.\" \"Can't you?\" The stab of rage felt like a spike driven through Harry's head: he forced his own fist into his mouth to stop himself from crying out in pain. He closed his eyes, and suddenly he was Voldemort, looking into Snape's pale face. \"My wand of yew did everything of which I asked it, Severus, except to kill Harry Potter. Twice it failed. Ollivander told me under torture of the twin cores, told me to take another's wand. I did so, but Lucius's wand shattered upon meeting Potter's.\" \"I--I have no explanation, my Lord.\" Snape was not looking at Voldemort now. His dark eyes were still fixed upon the coiling serpent in its protective sphere. \"I sought a third wand, Severus. the Elder Wand, the Wand of Destiny, the Deathstick. I took it from its previous master. I took it from the grfave of Albus Dumbledore.\" And now Snape looked at Voldemort, and Snape's face was like a death mask. it was marble white and so still that when he spoke, it was a shock to see that anyone lived behind the blank eyes. \"My Lord--let me go to the boy--\" \"all this long night when I am on the brink of victory, I have sat here,\" said Voldemort, his voice barely louder than a whisper, \"wondering, wondering, why the Elder Wand refuses to be what it ought to be, refuses to perform as legend says it must perform for its rightful owner...and I think I have the answer.\" Snape did not speak. \"Perhaps you already know it? You are a clever man, after all, Severus. You have been a good and faithful servant, and I regret what must happen.\" \"My Lord--\" \"The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I am not its true master. The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner. You killed Albus Dumbledore. While you live, Severus, the Elder Wand cannot truly be mine.\" \"My Lord!\" Snape protested, raising his wand. \"It cannot be any other way,\" said Voldemort. \"I must master the wand, Severus. Master the wand, and I master Potter at last.\" And Voldemort swiped the air with the Elder Wand. It did nothing to Sanpe, who for a split second seemed to think he had been reprieved: but then Voldemort's intention became clear. The snake's cage was rolling through the air, and before Snape could do anything more than yell, it had encased him, head and shoulders, and Voldemort spoke in Parseltongue. \"Kill.\" There was a terrible scream. Harry saw Snape's face losing the little color it had left; it whitened as his black eyes widened, as the snake's fangs pierced his neck, as he failed to push the enchanted cage off himself, as his knees gave way and he fell to the floor. \"I regret it,\" said Voldemort coldly. He turned away; there was no sadness in him, no remorse. It was time to leave this shack and take charge, with a wand that would now do his full bidding. He pointed it at the starry cage holding the snake, which drifted upward, off snape, who fell sideways onto the floor, blood gushing from the wounds in his neck. Voldemort swept from the room without a backward glance, and the great serpent floated after him in its huge protective sphere. Back in the tunnel and his own mind, Harry opened his eyes; He had drawn blood biting down on his knuckles in an effort not to shout out. Now he was looking through the tiny crack between crate and wall, watching a foot in a black boot trembling on the floor. \"Harry!\" breathed Hermione behind him, but he had already pointed his wand at the crate blocking his view. It lifted an inch into the air and drifted sideways silently. As quietly as he could, he pulled himself up into the room. He did not know why he was doing it, why he was approaching the dying man: he did not know what he felt as he saw Snape's white face, adn the fingers trying to staunch the bloody wound at his neck. Harry took off the invisibility cloak and looked down upon the man he hated, whose widening black eyes found Harry as he cried to speak. Harry bent over him, and Snape seized the front of his robes and pulled him close. A terrible rasping, gurgling noise issued from Snape's throat. \"Take...it...Take...it...\" Something more than blood was leaking from Snape. Silvery blue, neither gas nor liquid, it gushed form his mouth and his ears and his eyes, and Harry knew what it was, but did not know what to do-- A flask, conjured from thin air, was thrust into his shaking hand by Hermione. Harry lfited the silvery substance into it with his wand. When the falsk was full to the brim, and Snape looked as though there was no blood left in him, his grip on Harry's robes slackened. \"Look...at....me...\" he whispered. The green eyes found the black, but after a second, something in the depths of the dark pari seemed to vanish, leaving them fixed, blank, and empty. The hand holding Harry thudded to the floor, and Snape moved no more. \n",

            "-Eight The Missing Mirror Harry's feet touched the road. He saw the achingly familiar Hogsmeade High Street: dark shop fronts, and the mist line of black mountains beyond the village and the curve in the road ahead that led off toward Hogwarts, and light spilling from the windows of the Three Broomsticks, and with a lurch of the hear, he remembered with piercing accuracy, how he had landed here nearly a year before, supporting a desperately weak Dumbledore, all this in a second, upon landing -- and then, even as he relaxed his grip upon Ron's and Hermione's arms, it happened. The air was rent by a scream that sounded like Voldemort's when he had realized the cup had been stolen: It tore at every nerve in Harry's body, and he knew that their appearance had caused it. Even as he looked at the other two beneath the Cloak, the door of the Three Broomsticks burst open and a dozen cloaked and hooded Death Eaters dashed into the streets, their wands aloft. Harry seized Ron's wrist as he raised his wand; there were too many of them to run. Even attempting it would have give away their position. One of the Death Eaters raised his wand, and the scream stopped, still echoing around the distant mountains. \"Accio Cloak!\" roared one of the Death Eaters Harry seized his folds, but it made no attempt to escape. The Summoning Charm had not worked on it. \"Not under your wrapper, then, Potter?\" yelled the Death Eater who had tried the charm and then to his fellows. \"Spread now. He's here.\" Six of the Death Eaters ran toward them: Harry, Ron and Hermione backed as quickly as possible down the nearest side street, and the Death Eaters missed them by inches. They waited in the darkness, listening to the footsteps running up and down, beams of light flying along the street from the Death Eaters' searching wands. \"Let's just leave!\" Hermione whispered. \"Disapparate now!\" \"Great idea,\" said Ron, but before Harry could reply, a Death Eater shouted, \"We know you are here, Potter, and there's no getting away! We'll find you!\" \"They were ready for us,\" whispered Harry. \"They set up that spell to tell them we'd come. I reckon they’ve done something to keep us here, trap us - \" \"What about dementors?\" called another Death Eater. \"Let'em have free rein, they'd find him quick enough!\" \"The Dark Lord wants Potter dead by no hands but his - \" \" 'an dementors won't kill him! The Dark Lord wants Potter's life, nor his soul. He'll be easier to kill if he's been Kissed first!\" There were noises of agreement. Dread filled Harry: To repel dementors they would have to produce Patronuses which would give them away immediately. \"We're going to have to try to Disapparate, Harry!\" Hermione whispered. Even as she said it, he felt the unnatural cold being spread over the street. Light was sucked from the environment right up to the stars, which vanished. In the pitch blackness, he felt Hermione take hold of his arm and together, they turned on the spot. The air through which they needed to move, seemed to have become solid: They could not Disapparate; the Death Eaters had cast their charms well. The cold was biting deeper and deeper into Harry's flesh. He, Ron and Hermione retreated down the side street, groping their way along the wall trying not to make a sound. Then, around the corner, gliding noiselessly, came dementors, ten or more of them, visible because they were of a denser darkness than their surroundings, with their black cloaks and their scabbed and rotting hands. Could they sense fear in the vicinity? Harry was sure of it: They seemed to be coming more quickly now, taking those dragging, rattling breaths he detested, tasting despair in the air, closing in - He raised his wand: He could not, would not suffer the Dementor's Kiss, whatever happened afterward. It was of Ron and Hermione that he thought as he whispered \"Expecto Patronum!\" The silver stag burst from his wand and charged: The Dementors scattered and there was a triumphant yell from somewhere out of sight \"It's him, down there, down there, I saw his Patronus, it was a stag!\" The Dementors have retreated, the stars were popping out again and the footsteps of the Death Eaters were becoming louder; but before Harry in his panic could decide what to do, there was a grinding of bolts nearby, a door opened on the left-side of the narrow street, and a rough voice said: \"Potter, in here, quick!\" He obeyed without hesitation, the three of them hurried through the open doorway. \"Upstairs, keep the Cloak on, keep quiet!\" muttered a tall figure, passing them on his way into the street and slammed the door behind him. Harry had had no idea where they were, but now he saw, by the stuttering light of a single candle, the grubby, sawdust bar of the Hog's Head Inn. They ran behind the counter and through a second doorway, which led to a trickery wooden staircase, that they climbed as fast as they could. The stairs opened into a sitting room with a durable carpet and a small fireplace, above which hung a single large oil painting of a blonde girl who gazed out at the room with a kind of a vacant sweetness. Shouts reached from the streets below. Still wearing the Invisibility Cloak on, they hurried toward the grimy window and looked down. Their savior, whom Harry now recognized as the Hog's Head's barman, was the only person not wearing a hood. \"So what?\" he was bellowing into one of the hooded faces. \"So what? You send dementors down my street, I'll send a Patronus back at'em! I'm not having'em near me, I've told you that. I'm not having it!\" \"That wasn't your Patronus,\" said a Death Eater. \"That was a stag. It was Potter's!\" \"Stag!\" roared the barman, and he pulled out a wand. \"Stag! You idiot - Expecto Patronum!\" Something huge and horned erupted from the wand. Head down, it charged toward the High Street, and out of sight. \"That's not what I saw\" said the Death Eater, though was less certainly \"Curfew's been broken, you heard the noise,\" one of his companions told the barman. \"Someone was out on the streets against regulations - \" \"If I want to put my cat out, I will, and be damned to your curfew!\" \"You set off the Caterwauling Charm?\" \"What if I did? Going to cart me off to Azkaban? Kill me for sticking my nose out my own front door? Do it, then, if you want to! But I hope for your sakes you haven't pressed your little Dark Marks, and summoned him. He's not going to like being called here, for me and my old cat, is he, now?\" \"Don't worry about us.\" said one of the Death Eaters, \"worry about yourself, breaking curfew!\" \"And where will you lot traffic potions and poisons when my pub's closed down? What will happen to your little sidelines then?\" \"Are you threatening - ?\" \"I keep my mouth shut, it's why you come here, isn't it?\" \"I still say I saw a stag Patronus!\" shouted the first Death Eater. \"Stag?\" roared the barman. \"It's a goat, idiot!\" \"All right, we made a mistake,\" said the second Death Eater. \"Break curfew again and we won't be so lenient!\" The Death Eaters strode back towards the High Street. Hermione moaned with relief, wove out from under the Cloak, and sat down on a wobble-legged chair. Harry drew the curtains then pulled the Cloak off himself and Ron. They could hear the barman down below, rebolting the door of the bar, then climbing the stairs. Harry's attention was caught by something on the mantelpiece: a small, rectangular mirror, propped on top of it, right beneath the portrait of the girl. The barman entered the room. \"You bloody fools,\" he said gruffly, looking from one to the other of them. \"What were you thinking, coming here?\" \"Thank you,\" said Harry. \"You can't thank you enough. You saved our lives!\" The barman grunted. Harry approached him looking up into the face: trying to see past the long, stringy, wire-gray hair beard. He wore spectacles. Behind the dirty lenses, the eyes were a piercing, brilliant blue. \"It's your eye I've been seeing in the mirror.\" There was a silence in the room. Harry and the barman looked at each other. \"You sent Dobby.\" The barman nodded and looked around for the elf. \"Thought he'd be with you. Where've you left him? \"He's dead,\" said Harry, \"Bellatrix Lestrange killed him.\" The barman face was impassive. After a few moments he said, \"I'm sorry to hear it, I liked that elf.\" He turned away, lightning lamps with prods of his wand, not looking at any of them. \"You're Aberforth,\" said Harry to the man's back. He neither confirmed or denied it, but bent to light the fire. \"How did you get this?\" Harry asked, walking across to Sirius's mirror, the twin of the one he had broken nearly two years before. \"Bought it from Dung 'bout a year ago,\" said Aberforth. \"Albus told me what it was. Been trying to keep an eye out for you.\" Ron gasped. \"The silver doe,\" he said excitedly, \"Was that you too?\" \"What are you talking about?\" asked Aberforth. \"Someone sent a doe Patronus to us!\" \"Brains like that, you could be a Death Eater, son. Haven't I just prove my Patronus is a goat?\" \"Oh,\" said Ron, \"Yeah... well, I'm hungry!\" he added defensively as his stomach gave an enormous rumble. \"I got food,\" said Aberforth, and he sloped out of the room, reappearing moments later with a large loaf of bread, some cheese, and a pewter jug of mead, which he set upon a small table in front of the fire. Ravenous, they ate and drank, and for a while there was sound of chewing. \"Right then,\" said Aberforth when the had eaten their fill and Harry and Ron sat slumped dozily in their chairs. \"We need to think of the best way to get you out of here. Can't be done by night, you heard what happens if anyone moves outdoors during darkness: Caterwauling Charm's set off, they'll be onto you like bowtruckles on doxy eggs. I don't reckon I'll be able to pass of a stag as a goat a second time. Wait for daybreak when curfew lifts, then you can put your Cloak back on and set out on foot. Get right out of Hogsmeade, up into the mountains, and you'll be able to Disapparate there. Might see Hagrid. He's been hiding in a cave up there with Grawp ever since they tried to arrest him.\" \"We're not leaving,\" said Harry. \"We need to get into Hogwarts.\" \"Don't be stupid, boy,\" said Aberforth. \"We've got to,\" said Harry. \"What you've got to do,\" said Aberforth, leaning forward, \"is to get as far from here as from here as you can.\" \"You don't understand. There isn't much time. We've got to get into the castle. Dumbledore - I mean, your brother - wanted us - \" The firelight made the grimy lenses of Aberforth's glasses momentarily opaque, a bright flat white, and Harry remembered the blind eyes of the giant spider, Aragog. \"My brother Albus wanted a lot of things,\" said Aberforth, \"and people had a habit of getting hurt while he was carrying out his grand plans. You get away from this school, Potter, and out of the country if you can. Forget my brother and his clever schemes. He's gone where none of this can hurt him, and you don't owe him anything.\" \"You don't understand.\" said Harry again. \"Oh, don't I? said Aberforth quietly. \"You don't think I understood my own brother? Think you know Albus better than I did?\" \"I didn't mean that,\" said Harry, whose brain felt sluggish with exhaustion and from the surfeit of food and wine. \"It's... he left me a job.\" \"Did he now?\" said Aberforth. \"Nice job, I hope? Pleasant? Easy? Sort of thing you'd expect an unqualified wizard kid to be able to do without overstretching themselves?\" Ron gave a rather grim laugh. Hermione was looking strained. \"I-it's not easy, no,\" said Harry. \"But I've got to - \" \"Got to? Why got to? He's dead, isn't he?\" said Aberforth roughly. \"Let it go, boy, before you follow him! Save yourself!\" \"I can't.\" \"Why not?\" \"I - \" Harry felt overwhelmed; he could not explain, so he took the offensive instead. \"But you're fighting too, you're in the Order of the Phoenix - \" \"I was,\" said Aberforth. \"The Order of the Phoenix is finished. You-Know-Who's won, it's over, and anyone who's pretending different's kidding themselves. It'll never be safe for you here, Potter, he wants you too badly. So go abroad, go into hiding, save yourself. Best take these two with you.\" He jerked a thumb at Ron and Hermione. \"They'll be in danger long as they live now everyone knows they've been working with you.\" \"I can't leave,\" said Harry. \"I've got a job - \" \"Give it to someone else!\" \"I can't. It's got to be me, Dumbledore explained it all - \" \"Oh, did he now? And did he tell you everything, was he honest with you?\" Harry wanted him with all his heart to say \"Yes,\" but somehow the simple word would not rise to his lips, Aberforth seemed to know what he was thinking. \"I knew my brother, Potter. He learned secrecy at our mother's knee. Secrets and lies, that's how we grew up, and Albus... he was a natural.\" The old man's eyes traveled to the painting of the girl over the mantelpiece. It was, now Harry looked around properly, the only picture in the room. There was no photograph of Albus Dumbledore, nor of anyone else. \"Mr. Dumbledore\" said Hermione rather timidly. \"Is that your sister? Ariana? \"Yes.\" said Aberforth tersely. \"Been reading Rita Skeeter, have you, missy?\" Even by the rosy light of the fire it was clear that Hermione had turned red. \"Elphias Doge mentioned her to us,\" said Harry, trying to spare Hermione. \"That old berk,\" muttered Aberforth, taking another swig of mead. \"Thought the sun shone out of my brother's every office, he did. Well, so did plenty of people, you three included, by the looks of it.\" Harry kept quiet. He did not want to express the doubts and uncertainties about Dumbledore that had riddled him for months now. He had made his choice while he dug Dobby's grave, he had decided to continue along the winding, dangerous path indicated for him by Albus Dumbledore, to accept that he had not been told everything that he wanted to know, but simply to trust. He had no desire to doubt again; he did not want o hear anything that would deflect him from his purpose. He met Aberforth's gaze, which was so strikingly like his brothers': The bright blue eyes gave the same impression that they were X-raying the object of their scrutiny, and Harry thought that Aberforth knew what he was thinking and despised him for it. \"Professor Dumbledore cared about Harry, very much,\" said Hermione in a low voice. \"Did he now?\" said Aberforth. \"Funny thing how many of the people my brother cared about very much ended up in a worse state than if he'd left 'em well alone.\" \"What do you mean?\" asked Hermione breathlessly. \"Never you mind,\" said Aberforth. \"But that's a really serious thing to say!\" said Hermione. \"Are you - are you talking about your sister?\" Aberforth glared at her: His lips moved as if he were chewing the words he was holding back. Then he burst into speech. \"When my sister was six years old, she was attacked, by three Muggle boys. They'd seen her doing magic, spying through the back garden hedge: She was a kid, she couldn't control it, no witch or wizard can at that age. What they saw, scared them, I expect. They forced their way through the hedge, and when she couldn't show them the trick, they got a bit carried away trying to stop the little freak doing it.\" Hermione's eyes were huge in the firelight; Ron looked slightly sick. Aberforth stood up, tall as Albus, and suddenly terrible in his anger and the intensity of his pain. \"It destroyed her, what they did: She was never right again. She wouldn't use magic, but she couldn't get rid of it; it turned inward and drove her mad, it exploded out of her when she couldn't control it, and at times she was strange and dangerous. But mostly she was sweet and scared and harmless. \"And my father went after the bastards that did it,\" said Aberforth, \"and attacked them. And they locked him up in Azkaban for it. He never said why he'd done it, because the Ministry had known what Ariana had become, she'd have been locked up in St. Mungo's for good. They'd have seen her as a serious threat to the International Statute of Secrecy, unbalanced like she was, with magic exploding out of her at moments when she couldn't keep it in any longer. \"We had to keep her safe and quiet. We moved house, put it about she was ill, and my mother looked after her, and tried to keep her calm and happy. \"I was her favourite,\" he said, and as he said it, a grubby schoolboy seemed to look out through Aberforth's wrinkles and wrangled beard. \"Not Albus, he was always up in his bedroom when he was home, reading his books and counting his prizes, keeping up with his correspondence with \"the most notable magical names of the day,\" Aberforth succored. \"He didn't want to be bothered with her. She liked me best. I could get her to eat when she wouldn't do it for my mother, I could calm her down, when she was in one of her rages, and when she was quiet, she used to help me feed the goats. \"Then, when she was fourteen... See, I wasn't there.\" said Aberforth. \"If I'd been there, I could have calmed her down. She had one of her rages, and my mother wasn't as young as she was, and . . . it was an accident. Ariana couldn't control it. But my mother was killed.\" Harry felt a horrible mixture of pity and repulsion; he did not want to hear any more, but Aberforth kept talking, and Harry wondered how long it had been since he had spoken about this; whether, in fact, he had ever spoken about it. \"So that put paid to Albus's trip round the world with little Doge. The pair of 'em came home for my mother's funeral and then Doge went off on his own, and Albus settled down as head of the family. Ha!\" Aberforth spat into the fire. \"I'd have looked after her, I told him so, I didn't care about school, I'd have stayed home and done it. He told me I had to finish my education and he'd take over from my mother. Bit of a comedown for Mr. Brilliant, there's no prizes for looking after your half-mad sister, stopping her blowing up the house every other day. But he did all right for a few weeks . . . till he came.\" And now a positively dangerous look crept over Aberforth’s face. \"Grindelwald. And at last, my brother had an equal to talk to someone just as bright and talented he was. And looking after Ariana took a backseat then, while they were hatching all their plans for a new Wizarding order and looking for Hallows, and whatever else it was they were so interested in. Grand plans for the benefit of all Wizardkind, and if one young girl neglected, what did that matter, when Albus was working for the greater good? \"But after a few weeks of it, I'd had enough, I had. It was nearly time for me to go hack to Hogwarts, so I told 'em, both of 'em, face-to-face, like I am to you, now,\" and Aberforth looked downward Harry, and it took a little imagination to see him as a teenager, wiry and angry, confronting his elder brother. \"I told him, you'd better give it up now. You can't move her, she's in no fit state, you can't take her with you, wherever it is you're planning to go, when you're making your clever speeches, trying to whip yourselves up a following. He didn't like that.\" said Aberforth, and his eyes were briefly occluded by the fireflight on the lenses of his glasses: They turned white and blind again. \"Grindelwald didn't like that at all. He got angry. He told me what a stupid little boy I was, trying to stand in the way of him and my brilliant brother . . . Didn't I understand, my poor sister wouldn't have to be hidden once they'd changed the world, and led the wizards out of hiding, and taught the Muggles their place? \"And there was an argument . . . and I pulled my wand, and he pulled out his, and I had the Cruciatus Curse used on me by my brother's best friend - and Albus was trying to stop him, and then all three of us were dueling, and the flashing lights and the bangs set her off, she couldn't stand it - \" The color was draining from Aberforth's face as though he had suffered a mortal wound. \" - and I think she wanted to help, but she didn't really know what she was doing, and I don't know which of us did it, it could have been any of us - and she was dead.\" His voice broke on the last word and he dropped down into the nearest chair. Hermione's face was wet with tears, and Ron was almost as pale as Aberforth. Harry felt nothing but revulsion: He wished he had not heard it, wished he could wash is mind clean of it. \"I'm so . . . I'm so sorry,\" Hermione whispered. \"Gone,\" croaked Aberforth. \"Gone forever.\" He wiped his nose on hiss cuff and cleared his throat. \" 'Course, Grindelwald scarpered. He had a bit of a track record already, back in his own country, and he didn't want Ariana set to his account too. And Albus was free, wasn't he? Free of the burden of his sister, free to become the greatest wizard of the - \" \"He was never free,\" said Harry. \"I beg your pardon?\" said Aberforth. \"Never,\" said Harry. \"The night that your brother died, he drank a potion that drove him out of his mind. He started screaming, pleading with someone who wasn't there. 'Don't hurt them, please . . . hurt me instead.' \" Ron and Hermione were staring at Harry. He had never gone into details about what had happened on the island on the lake: The events that had taken place after he and Dumbledore had returned to Hogwarts had eclipsed it so thoroughly. \"He thought he was back there with you and Grindelwald, I know he did,\" said Harry, remembering Dumbledore whispering, pleading. \"He thought he was watching Grindelwald hurting you and Ariana . . . It was torture to him, if you'd seen him then, you wouldn't say he was free.\" Aberforth seemed lost in contemplation of his own knotted and veined hands. After a long pause he said. \"How can you be sure, Potter, that my brother wasn't more interested in the greater good than in you? How can you be sure you aren't dispensable, just like my little sister?\" A shard of ice seemed to pierce Harry's heart. \"I don't believe it. Dumbledore loved Harry,\" said Hermione. \"Why didn't he tell him to hide, then? shot back Aberforth. \"Why didn't he say to him, 'Take care of yourself, here's how to survive' ?\" \"Because,\" said Harry before Hermione could answer, \"sometimes you've got to think about more than your own safety! Sometimes you've got to think about the greater good! This is war!\" \"You're seventeen, boy!\" \"I'm of age, and I'm going to keep fighting even if you've given up!\" \"Who says I've given up?\" \"The Order of the Phoenix is finished,\" Harry repeated, \"You-Know-Who's won, it's over, and anyone who's pretending different's kidding themselves.\" \"I don't say I like it, but it's the truth!\" \"No, it isn't.\" said Harry. \"Your brother knew how to finish You-Know-Who and he passed the knowledge on to me. I'm going to keep going until I succeed - or I die. Don't think I don't know how this might end. I've known it for years.\" He waited for Aberforth to jeer or to argue, but he did not. He merely moved. \"We need to get into Hogwarts,\" said Harry again. \"If you can't help us, we'll wait till daybreak, leave you in peace, and try to find a way in ourselves. If you can help us - well, now would be a great time to mention it.\" Aberforth remained fixed in his chair, gazing at Harry with the eye, that were so extraordinarily like his brother's. At last he cleared his throat, got to his feet, walked around the little table, and approached the portrait of Ariana. \"You know what to do,\" he said. She smiled, turned, and walked away, not as people in portraits usually did, one of the sides of their frames, but along what seemed to be a long tunnel painted behind her. They watched her slight figure retreating until finally she was swallowed by the darkness. \"Er - what - ?\" began Ron. \"There's only one way in now,\" said Aberforth. \"You must know they've got all the old secret passageways covered at both ends, dementors all around the boundary walls, regular patrols inside the school from what my sources tell me. The place has never been so heavily guarded. How you expect to do anything once you get inside it, with Snape in charge and the Carrows as his deputies. . . well, that's your lookout, isn't it? You say you're prepared to die.\" \"But what . . . ?\" said Hermione, frowning at Ariana's picture. A tiny white dot reappeared at the end of the painted tunnel, and now Ariana was walking back toward them, growing bigger and bigger as she came. But there was somebody else with her now, someone taller than she was, who was limping along, looking excited. His hair was longer than Harry had ever seen. He appeared and torn. Larger and larger the two figures grew, until only their heads and shoulders filled the portrait. Then the whole thing swang forward on the wall like a little door, and the entrance to a real tunnel was revealed. And our of it, his hair overgrown, his face cut, his robes ripped, clambered the real Neville Longbottom, who gave a roar of delight, leapt down from the mantelpiece and yelled. \"I knew you'd come! I knew it, Harry!\" \n",

            ": The Unbreakable Vow Snow was swirling against the icy windows once more; Christmas was approaching fast. Hagrid had already singlehandedly delivered the usual twelve C hristmas trees to the Great Hall; garlands of holly and tinsel had been twisted around the banisters of the stairs; everlasting candles glowed from inside the helmets of suits of armor and great bunches of mistletoe had been hung at intervals along the corridors. Large groups of girls tended to converge underneath the mistletoe bunches every time Harry went past, which caused blockages in the corridors; fortunat e ly, however, Harry's frequent nighttime wanderings had given him an unusually good knowledge of the castle's secret passageways, so that he was often, without too much difficulty, to naviga t e mistletoe-free routes between classes. Ron, who might once have found the necessity of these detours excuse for jealousy rather than hilarity, simply roared with laughter about it all. Although Harry much preferred this new laughing, joking Ron to the moody, aggressive model he had been enduring for the last few weeks, the improved Ron came at a heavy price. Firstly, Harry had to put up with the frequent presence of Lavender Brown, who seemed to regard any moment that she was not kissing Ron as a moment wasted; and secondly, Harry found himself once more the best friend of two people who seemed unlikely ever to speak to each other again. Ron, whose hands and forearms still bore scratches and cuts from Hermione's bird attack, was taking a defensive and resentful tone. \"She can't complain,\" he told Harry. \"She snogged Krum. So she's found out someone wants to snog me too. Well, it's a free country. I haven't done anything wrong.\" Harry did not answer, but pretended to be absorbed in the book they were supposed to have read before Charms next morning (Quintessence: A Q uest). Determined as he was to remain friends with both Ron and Hermione, he was spending a lot of time with his mouth shut tight. \"I never promised Hermione anything , \" Ron mumbled. \"I mean, all right, I was going to go to Slughorn's Christmas party with her, but she never said... just as friends... I'm a free agent...\" Harry turned a page of Quintessence, aware that Ron was watching him. Ron's voice trailed away in mutters, barely audible over the loud crackling of the fire, though Harry thought he caught the words \"Krum\" and \"Can't complain\" again. Hermione's schedule was so full that Harry could only talk to her properly in the evenings, when Ron was, in any case, so tightly wrapped around Lavender that he did not notice what Harry was doing. Hermione refused to sit in the common room while Ron was there, So Harry generally joined her in the library, which meant that their conversations were held in whispers. \"He's at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes,\" said Hermione, while the librarian , Madam Pince, prowled the shelves behind them. \"I really couldn't care less.\" She raised her quill and dotted an 'i' so ferociously that she punctured a hole in her parchment. Harry said nothing. He thought his voice might soon vanish from the lack of use. He bent a little lower over Advanced Potion-Making and continued to make notes on Everlasting Elixirs, occasionally pausing to decipher the p rince's useful additions to Libatius B orage's text. \"And incidentally,\" said Hermione, after a few moments, \"you need to be careful.\" \"For the last time,\" said Harry, speaking in a slightly hoarse tone after three-quarters of an ho u r of silence, \"I am not giving back this book . I've learned more from the Half-blood p rince than Snape or Slughorn have taught me in--\" \"I'm not talking about your stupid so-called prince,\" said Hermione , giving his book a nasty look as though it had been rude to her. \"I'm talki ng about earlier. I went into the girl's bathroom just before I came in here and there were about a dozen girls in there, including that Romilda Vane , trying to decide how to slip you a love potion. They're all hoping they're going to get you to take them to Slughorn's party, and thay all seem to have bought Fred and George's love potions, which I'm afraid to say probably work --\" \"Why didn't you confiscate them then?\" demanded Harry, it seemed extraordinary that Hermione's m ania for upholding the rules could have abandoned her at this crucial juncture. \"They didn't have the potions with them in the bathroom,\" said Hermione scornfully, \"They were just discussing tactics. As I doubt the Half-blood prince\" she gave the book another scornful look \"could dream up an antidote for a dozen different love potions at once, I'd just invite someone to go with you, that'll stop all the others thinking they've still got a chance. It's tomor r ow night, they're getting desperate.\" \"There isn't anyone I want to invite,\" mumbled Harry, who was still not trying to think about Ginny any more than he could help, despite the fact the fact that she kept cropping up in his dreams in ways that made him devoutly thankful that Ron could not perform Legilimency. \"Well, just be careful what you drink, because Romilda Va ne looked like she meant business.\" said Hermione grimly. She hitched up the long roll of parchment on which she was writing her Arithma n cy essay and continued to scratch away with her quill. Harry wa t che d her with his mind a long way away. \"Hang on a moment,\" he said slowly. \"I thought Filch had banned anything bought at Weasley's Wizard Wheezes?\" \"And when has anyone ever paid attention to what Filch has banned?\" asked Hermione, still concentrating on her essay. \"But I thought all the owls were being searched. So how come these grils are able to bring love potions into the school?\" \"Fred and George send them disguised as perfumes and cough potions,\" said Hermione. \"It's part of their Owl order service.\" \"You know a lot about it.\" Hermione gave him the kind of nasty look she had just given his copy of Advanced Potion-Making. \"It was all on the back of the bottles they showed Ginny and me in the summer,\" she said coldly, \"I don't go around putting potions in people's drinks... or pretending too eit h er, which is just as bad...\" \"Yeah, well, never mind that,\" said Harry quickly. \"The point is, Filch is being fooled isn't he? These girls are getting stuff into the school disguised as something else! So why couldn't Malfoy have brought the necklace into the school --?\" \"Oh, Harry... not that again...\" \"Come on, why not?\" demanded Harry. \"Look , \" sighed Hermione, \"Secrecy Sensors detect jinxes, curses, and concealment charms, don't they? They're used to find d ark magic and d ark obje c ts. They'd have picked up a powerful curse , like the one in the necklace, withi n seconds. But something that's just been put in the wrong bottle wouldn ' t register -- anyway Love potions aren't d ark or dangerous -\" \"Easy for you to say,\" muttered Harry, thinking of Romilda Vane. \"-- so it would be down to Filch to realise it wasn't a cough potion, and he's not a very good wizard, I doubt he can tell one potion from --\" Hermione stopped dead; Harry had heard it too. Somebody had moved close behind them among the dark bookshelves. They waited, and a moment later the vulturelike countenance of Madam Pince appeared around the corner, her sunken cheeks, her skin like parchment, and her long hooked nose illuminated unflatteringly by the lamp she was carrying. \"The library is now closed,\" she said, \"Mind you return anything you have borrowed to the correct -- what have you been doing to that book, you depraved boy?\" \"It isn't the library's, it's mine!\" said Harry hastily, snatching his copy of Advanced Potion-Making off the table as she lunged at it with a clawlike hand. \" Spoiled!\" she hissed . \"Desecrated, befouled !\" \"It's just a book that's been written on!\" said Harry, tugging it out of her grip. She looked as though she might have a seizure; Hermione, who had hastily packed her things, grabbed Harry by the arm and frogmarched him away. \"She'll ban you from the library if you're not careful. Why did you have to bring that stupid book?\" \"It's not my fault she's barking mad, Hermione. Or d'you think she overheard you being rude about Filch? I've always thought there might be something between them...\" \"Oh, ha ha..\" Enjoying the fact that they could speak normally again, they made their way along the deserted lamp-lit corridors back to the common room, arguing w hether or not Filch and Madam Pince were secretly in love with each other. \"Baubles\" said Harry to the Fat Lady, this being the new, festive password. \"Same to you,\" said the fat lady with a roguish grin, and she swung forward to admit them. \"Hi, Harry!\" said Romilda Vane, the moment he had climbed through the portrait hole. \"Fancy a gillywater?\" Hermione gave him a \"what-did-I-tell-you?\" look over her shoulder. \"No thanks,\" said Harry quickly. \"I don't like it much.\" \"Well, take these anyway,\" said Romilda, thrusting a box into his hands. \"Chocolate Cauldrons, they've got firewhiskey in them. My gran sent them to me, but I don't like them.\" \"Oh-- right -- thanks a lot.\" said Harry, who could not think what else to say. \" Er-- I ' m just going over here with ...\" He hurried off behind Hermione, his voice tailing away feebly. \"Told you,\" said Hermione succinctly, \" Sooner you ask someone, sooner they'll all leave you alone and you can --\" But her face suddnly turned blank; she had just spotted Ron and Lavender, who were i ntertwined in the same armchair. \"Well, good night, Harry\" said Hermione, though it was only seven o'clock in the evening, and she left for the girl s' dormitory without another word. Harry went to bed comforting himself that there was only one more day of lessons to struggle through, plus Slughorn's party, after which he and Ron would depart together for the B urrow. It now seemed impossible that Ron and Hermione would make up with each other before the holidays began, but perhaps, somehow, the break would give them time to calm down, think better of their behavior... But his hopes were not high, and they sank still lower after enduring a Transfiguration lesson with them both next day. They had just embarked upon the immensely difficult topic of human transfiguration; working in front of mirrors , they were suposed to be changing the color of their own eyebrows. Hermione laughed unkindly at Ron's disastrous first attempt, during which he somehow managed to give himself a spectacular handlebar mustache; Ron retaliated by doing a cruel but accurate impression of Hermione jumping up and down in her seat every time Profe s sor McGonagall asked a question, which Lavender and Parvati found deeply amusing and which reduced Hermione to the verge of tears again. She raced out of the classroom on the bell, leaving half her things behind; Harry, deciding that her need was greater than Ron's just now, scooped up her remaining po ssessions and followed her. He finally tracked her down as she emerged from a girl's bathroom on the floor below. She was accompanied by Luna Lovegood, who was patting her vaguely on the back. \"Oh, hello, Harry , \" said Luna . \" D id you know one of your eyebrows is bright yellow?\" \"Hi, Luna. Hermione , you left your stuff...\" He held out her books. \"Oh, yes,\" said Hermione in a choked voice, taking her things and turning away quickly to hide the fact she was wiping her eyes with her pencil case. \"Thank you , Harry. Well, I'd better get going...\" And she hurried off, without ever giving Harry any time to offer words of comfort, though admittedly he could not think of any. \"She's a bit upset , \" said Luna. \"I thought at first it was Moaning Myrtle in there, but it turned out to be Hermione. She said something about Ron Weasley...\" \"Yeah, they've had a row,\" said Harry. \"He says funny things sometimes, doesn't he?\" said Luna as they set off down the corridor together. \"But he can be a bit unkind. I noticed that last year.\" \" I s'pose , \" said Harry. Luna was demonstrating her usual knack of speaking uncomfortable truths; he had never met anyone quite like her. \"So have you had a good term?\" \"Oh, it's been al l right,\" said Luna. \" A bit lonely without the D.A. Ginny's been nice, though. She stopped two boys in our Transfiguration class calling me 'Loony' the other day --\" \"How would you like to come to S lughorn's party with me tonight?\" The words were out of Harry's mouth before he could stop them; he heard himself say them as though it were a stranger speaking. Luna turned her protuberant eyes to him in surprise. \"Slughorn's party? With you?\" \"Yeah,\" said Harry, \"We're supposed to bring guests, so I thought you might like.. I mean...\" He was keen to make his intentions perfectly clear. \" I mean, just as friends, you know. But if you don't want to...\" He was already half hoping that she didn't want to. \"O h no, I'd love to go with you as friends!\" said Luna, beaming as he had never seen her beam before. \"Nobody's ever asked me to a party before, as a friend! Is that why you dyed your eyebrow, for the party? Should I dye mine too?\" \"No\" said Harry firmly, \"That was a mistake. I'll get Hermione to put it right for me. So I'll meet you in the entrance hall at eight o'clock then . \" \"AHA!\" screamed a voice from overhead and both of them jumped; unnoticed by either of them, they had just passed underneath Peeves, who was hanging upside down from a chandelier and grinning maliciously at them. \"Potty asked Loony to go to the part y ! Potty lurves Loony! Potty luuuuuurves Looooony!\" And he zoomed away cackling and shrieking, \"Potty loves Loony!\" \"Nice to keep these things private,\" said Harry. And sure enough, in no time at all the whole school seemed to know that Harry Potter was taking Luna Lovegood to Slughorn's party. \"You could've taken anyone!\" said Ron in disbelief over dinner. \"Anyone! And you chose Loony Lovegood?\" \"Don't call her that, Ron!\" snapped Ginny, pausing behind Harry on her way to join friends. \"I'm really glad you're taking her Harry, she's so excited.\" And she moved on down the table to sit with Dean. Harry tried to feel pleased that Ginny was glad he was taking Luna to the party but could not quite manage it. A long way along the table Hermione was sitting alone, playing with her stew. Harry noticed Ron looking at her furtively. \"You could say sorry , \" suggested Harry bluntly. \"What , and get attacked by another flock of canaries?\" muttered Ron. \"What did you have to imitate her for?\" \"She laughed at my mustache!\" \"So did I, it was the stupidest thing I've ever seen.\" But Ron did not seem to have he a rd; Lavender had just arrived with Parvati. Squeezing herself in between Harry and Ron, Lavender flung her arms around Ron's neck. \"Hi, Harry,\" said Parvati who, like Harry, looked faintly embarrassed and bored by the behavior of their two friends. \"Hi,\" said Harry, \"How're you? You're staying at Hogwarts, then? I heard your parents wanted you to leave.\" \"I managed to talk them out o f it for the time being,\" said Parvati. \"That Katie thing really freaked them out, but as there hasn't been anything since... Oh, hi, Hermione!\" Parvati positively beamed. Harry could tell that she was feeling guilty for having laughed at Hermione in Transfiguration. He looked around and saw that Hermione was beaming back, if possible even more brightly. Girls were very strange sometimes. \"Hi, Parvati!\" said Hermione, ignoring Ron and Lavender completely. \"Are you going to Slughorn's party tonight?\" \"No invite,\" said Parvati gloomily. \"I'd love to go, though, it sounds like it's going to be really good... You're going, aren't you?\" \"Yes, I'm meeting Cormac at eight, and we're -\" There was a noise like a plunger being withdrawn from a blocked sink , and Ron surfaced. Hermione acted as though she had not seen or heard anything. \"- we're going up to the party together.\" \"Cormac?\" said Parvati. \"Cormac McLaggen, you mean?\" \"That's right,\" said Hermione sweetly. \"The one who *almost*\" - she put a great deal of emphasis on the word - \"bec a me Gryffindor Keeper.\" \"Are you going out with him, then?\" asked Parvati, wide-eyed. \"Oh - yes - didn't you know?\" said Harmione, with a most un-Hermione-ish giggle. \"No!\" said Parvati, looking positively agog at thi s piece of gossip. \"Wow , you like your Quidditch players, don't you? First Krum, then McLaggen.\" \"I like *really good* Quidditch players,\" Hermione corrected her, still smiling. \"Well, see you... Got to go and get ready for the party...\" She left. At once Lavender and Parvati put their heads together to discuss this new development, with everything they had ever heard about McLaggen, and all they had ever guessed about Hermione. Ron looked strangely blank and said nothing. Harry was left to ponder in silence the depths to which girls would sink to get revenge. When he arrived in the entrance hall at eight o'clock that night, he found an unusually large number of girls lurking there, all of whom seemed to be staring at him resentfully as he approached Luna. She was wearing a set of spangled silver robes that were attracting a certain amount of giggles from the onlookers, but otherwise she looked quite nice. Harry was glad, in any case, that she had left off her radish earrings, her butterbeer cork necklace, and her Spectrespecs. \"Hi,\" he said. \"Shall we get going then?\" \"Oh yes,\" she said happily. \"Where is the party?\" \"Slughorn's office,\" said Harry, leading her up the marble staircase away from all the staring and muttering. \"Did you hear, there's supposed to be a vampire coming?\" \"Rufus Scrimgeour?\" asked Luna. \"I - what?\" said Harry, disconcerted. \"You mean the Minister of Magic?\" \"Yes, he's a vampire,\" said Luna matter-of-factly. \"Father wrote a very long article about it when Scrimgeour first took over from Cornelius Fudge, but he was forced not to publish by somebody from the Ministry. Obviously, they didn't want the truth to get out!\" Harry, who thought it most unlikely that Rufus Scrimgeour was a vampire, but who was used to Luna repeating her father's bizarre views as though they were fact, did not reply; they were already approaching Slughorn's office and the sounds of laughter, music, and loud conversation were growing louder with every step they took. Whether it had been built that way, or because he had used magical trickery to make it so, Slughorn's office was much larger than the usual teacher's study. The ceiling and walls had been draped with emerald, crimson , and gold hangings, so that it looked as though they were all inside a vast tent. The room was crowded and stuffy and bathed in the red light cast by an ornate golden lamp dangling from the center of the ceiling in which real fairies were fluttering, each a brilliant speck of light. Loud singing accompanied by what sounded like mandolins issued from a distant corner; a haze of pipe smoke hung over several elderly warlocks deep in conversation, and a number of house-elves were negotiating their way squeakily through the forest of knees, obscured by the heavy silver platters of food they were bearing, so that they looked like little roving tables. \"Harry, m'boy!\" boomed Slughorn, almost as soon as Harry and Luna had squeezed in through the door. \"Come in, come in, so many people I'd like you to meet!\" Slughorn was wearing a tasseled velvet hat to match his smoking jacket. Gripping Harry's arm so tightly he might have been hoping to Disapparate with him, Slughorn led him purposefully into the party; Harry seized Luna's hand and dragged her along with him. \"Harry, I'd like you to meet Eldred Worple, an old student of mine, author of ' Blood Brothers: My L ife Amongst the Vampires' - and, of course, his friend Sanguini.\" Worple, who was a small, stout, bespectacled man, grabbed Harry's hand and shook it enthusiastically; the vampire Sanguini, who was tall and emaciated with dark shadows under his eyes, merely nodded. He looked rather bored. A gaggle of girls was standing close to him, looking curious and excited. \"Harry Potter, I am simply delighted!\" said Worple, peering shortsightedly up into Harry's face. \"I was saying to Professor Slughorn only the other day, 'Where is the biography of Harry Potter for which we have all been waiting?'\" \"Er,\" said Harry, \"were you?\" \"Just as modest as Horace described!\" said Worple. \"But seri-ously\" -- his manner changed; it became suddenly businesslike -- \"I would be delighted to write it myself-- people are craving to know more about you, dear boy, craving! If you were prepared to grant me a few interviews, say in four- or five-hour sessions, why, we could have the book finished within months. And all with very little effort on your part, I assure you -- ask Sanguini here if it isn't quite -- Sanguini, stay here!\" added Worple, suddenly stern, for the vampire had been edging toward the nearby group of girls, a rather hungry look in his eye. \"Here, have a pasty,\" said Worple, seizing one from a passing elf and stuffing it into Sanguini's hand before turning his attention back to Harry. \"My dear boy, the gold you could make, you have no idea --\" \"I'm definitely not interested,\" said Harry firmly, \"and I've just seen a friend of mine, sorry.\" He pulled Luna after him into the crowd; he had indeed just seen a long mane of brown hair disappear between what looked like two members of the Weird Sisters. \"Hermione! Hermione !\" \"Harry! There you are, thank goodness! Hi, Luna !\" \"What's happened to you?\" asked Harry, for Hermione looked distinctly disheveled, rather as though she had just fought her way out of a thicket of Devil's Snare. \"Oh, I've just escaped -- I mean, I've just left Cormac,\" she said. \"Under the mistletoe,\" she added in explanation, as Harry continued to look questioningly at her. \"Serves you right for coming with him,\" he told her severely. \"I thought he'd annoy Ron most,\" said Hermione dispassion-ately. \"I debated for a while about Zacharias Smith, but I thought, on the whole --\" \"You considered Smith?\" said Harry, revoked. \"Yes, I did, and I'm starting to wish I'd chosen him, McLaggen makes Grawp look a gentleman. Let's go this way, we'll be able to see him coming, he's so tall. . . .\" The three of them made their way over to the other side of the room, scooping up goblets of mead on the way, realizing too late that Professor Trelawney was standing there alone. \"Hello,\" said Luna politely to Professor Trelawney. \"Good evening, my dear,\" said Professor Trelawney, focusing upon Luna with some difficulty. Harry could smell cooking sherry again. \"I haven't seen you in my classes lately. ..\" \"No, I've got Firenze this year,\" said Luna. \"Oh, of course,\" said Professor Trelawney with an angry, drunken titter. \"Or Dobbin, as I prefer to think of him. You would have thought, would you not, that now I am returned to the school Professor Dumbledore might have got rid of the horse? But no ... we share classes. . . . It's an insult, frankly, an insult. Do you know. . .\" Professor Trelawney seemed too tipsy to have recognized Harry. Under cover of her furious criticisms of Firenze, Harry drew closer to Hermione and said, \"Let ' s get something straight. Are you planning to tell Ron that you interfered at Keeper tryouts?\" Hermione raised her eyebrows. \"Do you really think I'd stoop that low?\" Harry looked at her shrewdly. \"Hermione, if you can ask 0111 McLaggen --\" \"There's a difference,\" said Hermione with dignity. \"I've got no plans to tell Ron anything about what might, or might not, have happened at Keeper tryouts.\" \"Good,\" said Harry fervently. \"Because he'll just fall apart again, and we'll lose the next match --\" \"Quidditch!\" said Hermione angrily. \"Is that all boys care about? Cormac hasn't asked me one single question about myself, no, I've just been treated to 'A Hundred Great Saves Made by Cormac McLaggen' nonstop ever since -- oh no, here he comes!\" She moved so fast it was as though she had Disapparated; one moment she was there, the next, she had squeezed between two guffawing witches and vanished. \"Seen Hermione?\" asked McLaggen, forcing his way through the throng a minute later. \"No, sorry,\" said Harry, and he turned quickly to join in Luna's conversation, forgetting for a split second to whom she was talking. \"Harry Potter!\" said Professor Trelawney in deep, vibrant tones, noticing him for the first time. \"Oh, hello,\" said Harry unenthusiastically. \"My dear boy!\" she said in a very carrying whisper. \"The rumors! The stories! 'The Chosen One'! Of course, I have known for a very long time. . . . The omens were never good, Harry. . . But why have you not returned to Divination? For you, of all people, the subject is of the utmost importance!\" \"Ah, Sybi l l, we all think our subject's most important!\" said a loud voice, and Slughorn appeared at Professor Trelawney s other side, his face very red, his velvet hat a little askew, a glass of mead in one hand and an enormous mince pie in the other. \"But I don't t hink I've ever known such a natural at Potions!\" said Slughorn, re-garding Harry with a fond, if bloodshot, eye. \"Instinctive, you know -- like his mother! I've only ever taught a few with this kind of ability, I can tell you that, Sybi l l -- why even Severus --\" And to Harry's horror, Slughorn threw out an arm and seemed to scoop Snape out of thin air toward them. \"Stop skulking and come and join us, Severus!\" hiccuped Slughorn happily. \"I was just talking about Harry's exceptional po-tion-making! Some credit must go to you, of course, you taught him for five years!\" Trapped, with Slughorns arm around his shoulders, Snape looked down his hooked nose at Harry, his black eyes narrowed. \"Funny, I never had the impression that I managed to teach Potter anything at all.\" \"Well, then, it's natural ability!\" shouted Slughorn. \"You should have seen what he gave me, first lesson, Draught of Living Death -- never had a student produce finer on a first attempt, I don't think even you, Severus --\" \"Really?\" said Snape quietly, his eyes still boring into Harry, who felt a certain disquiet. The last thing he wanted was for Snape to start investigating the source of his newfound brilliance at Potions. \"Remind me what other subjects you're taking, Harry?\" asked Slughorn . \"Defense Against the D ark Arts, Charms, Transfiguration , Herbology...\" \"All the subjects required, in short, for an Auror ,\" said Snap e with the faintest sneer. \"Yeah, well, that's what I'd like to do,\" said Harry defiantly. \"And a great one you'll make too!\" boomed Slughorn. \"I don't think you should be an Auror, Harry,\" said Luna unex pectedly. Everybody looked at her. \"The Aurors are part of the Rotfang Conspiracy, I thought everyone knew that. They're planning to bring down the Ministry of Magic from within using a c om bination of Dark Magic and gum disease.\" Harry inhaled half his mead up his nose as he started to lau gh. Really, it had been worth bringing Luna just for this. Emerging, from his goblet, coughing, sopping wet but still grinning, he saw something calculated to raise his spirits even higher: Draco Malf o y being dragged by the ear toward them by Argus Filch. \"Professor Slughorn,\" wheezed Filch, his jowls aquiver and the maniacal light of mischief-detection in his bulging eyes, \"I discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor. He claims to have been invited to your party and to have been delayed in setting out. Did you issue him with an invitation?\" Malfoy pulled himself free of Filchs grip, looking furious. \"All right, I wasn't invited!\" he said angrily. \"I was trying to gate crash, happy?\" \"No, I'm not!\" said Filch, a statement at complete odds with the glee on his face. \"You're in trouble, you are! Didn't the headma ster say that nighttime prowling ' s out, unless you've got permission, didn't he, eh?\" \"That's all right, Argus, that's all right,\" said Slughorn, waving it 1.1 nd. \"It's Christmas, and it's not a crime to want to come to a party . Just this once, we'll forget any punishment; you may stay , Draco. Fil ich's expression of outraged disappointment was perfectly pre di c t able; but why, Harry wondered, watching him, did Malfoy look almost equally unhappy? And why was Snape looking at Mal-foy as though both angry and . . . was it p ossible? ... a lit tl afraid? But almost before Harry had registered what he had seen, Filch had turned and shuffled away, muttering under his breath; Malfoy h ad composed his face into a smile and was thanking Slughorn for his generosity, and Snape's face was smoothly inscrutable again. \"It's nothing, nothing,\" said Slughorn, waving away Malfoy's t hanks. \"I did know your grandfather, after all....\" \"He always spoke very highly of you, sir,\" said Malfoy quickly. \"Said you were the best potion-maker he'd ever known. ...\" Harry stared at Malfoy. It was not the sucking-up that intrigued him; he had watched Malfoy do that to Snape for a long time. It was the fact that Malfoy did, after all, look a little ill. This was the first time he had seen Malfoy close up for ages; he now saw that Malfoy had dark shadows under his eyes and a distinctly grayish tinge to his skin. \"I'd like a word with you, Draco,\" said Snape suddenly. \"Now , Severus,\" said Slughorn, hiccuping again, \"it's Christ mas, do n't be too hard --\" \"I am his Head of House, and I shall decide how hard, or other-wise, to be,\" said Snape curtly. \"Follow me, Draco.\" They left, Snape leading the way, Malfoy looking resentful. Harry stood there for a moment, irresolute, then said, \"I'll be back in a bit, Luna -- er -- bathroom.\" \"All right,\" she said cheerfully, and he thought he heard her, as he hurried off into the crowd, resume the subject of the Rotfang Conspiracy with Professor Trelawney, who seemed sincerely in terested. It was easy, once out of the party, to pull his Invisibility Cloak out of his pocket and throw it over himself, for the corridor was quite deserted. What was more difficult was finding Snape and Malfoy. Harry ran down the corridor, the noise of his feet masked by the music and loud talk still issuing from Slughorn's office behind him. Perhaps Snape had taken Malfoy to his office in the dungeons ... or perhaps he was escorting him back to the Slyt herin common room. . . . Harry pressed his ear against door after door as he dashed down the corridor until, with a great jolt of excitement, he crouched down to the keyhole of the last classroom in the corridor and heard voices. \" . . . cannot afford mistakes, Draco, because if you are expelled --\" \"I didn't have anything to do with it, all right?\" \"I hope you are telling the truth, because it was both clumsy a nd foolish. Already you are suspected of having a hand in it.\" \"Who suspects me?\" said Malfoy angrily. \"For the last time, I didn't do it, okay? That Bell girl must ' ve had an enemy no on e knows about -- don't look at me like that! I know what you're do-ing, I'm not stupid, but it won't work -- I can stop you!\" There was a pause and then Snape said quietly, \"Ah . . . Aunt Bellatrix has been teaching you Occlumency, I see. What thoughts are you trying to conceal from your master, Draco?\" \"I'm not trying to conceal anything from him, I just don't want you butting in !\" Harry pressed his ear still more closely against the keyhole. . . . What had happened to make Malfoy speak to Snape like this -- Snape, toward whom he had always shown respect, even liking? \"So that is why you have been avoiding me this term? You have feared my interference? You realize that, had anybody else failed to come to my office when I had told them repeatedly to be there, Draco --\" \"So put me in detention! Report me to Dumbledore!\" jeered Malfoy. There was another pause. Then Snape said, \"You know perfectly well that I do not wish to do either of those things .\" \"You'd better stop telling me to come to your office then!\" \"Listen to me,\" said Snape, his voice so low now that Harry had to push his ear very hard against the keyhole to hear. \"I am trying to help you. I swore to your mother I would protect you. I made the Unbreakable Vow, Draco --\" \"Looks like you'll have to break it, then, because I don't need your protection! It's my job, he gave it to me and I'm doing it, I've got a plan and it's going to work, it's just taking a bit longer than I thought it would!\" \"What is your plan ?\" \"It's none of your business !\" \" If you tell me what you are trying to do, I can assist you ...\" \"I have all the assistance I need, thanks, I'm not alone!\" \"You were certainly alone tonight, which was foolish in the ex-treme, wandering the corridors without lookouts or backup, these are elementary mistakes --\" \"I would've had Crabbe and Goyle with me if you hadn't put them in detention!\" \"Keep your voice down!\" spat Snape, for Malfoy ' s voice had risen excitedly. \"If your friends Crabbe and Goyle intend to pass their Defense Against the Dark Arts OWL this time around, they will need to work a little harder than they are doing at pres --\" \"What does it matter?\" said Malfoy. \"Defense Against the Dark Arts -- its all just a joke, isn't it, an act? Like any of us need pro-tecting against the Dark Arts --\" \"It is an act that is crucial to success, Draco!\" said Snape. \"Where do you think I would have been all these years, if I had not known how to act? Now listen to me! You are being incautious, wandering around at night, getting yourself caught, and if you are placing your reliance in assistants like Crabbe and Goyle --\" \"They're not the only ones, I've got other people on my side, better people!\" \"Then why not confide in me, and I can --\" \"I know what you're up to! You want to steal my glory!\" There was another pause, then Snape said coldly, \"You are speaking like a child. I quite understand that your fathers capture and imprisonment has upset you, but --\" Harry had barely a second ' s warning; he heard Malfoy's footsteps on the other side of the door and flung himself out of the way just as it burst open . Malfoy was striding away down the corridor, past the open door of Slughorns office, around the distant corner, and out of sight. Hardly daring to breathe, Harry remained crouched down as Snape emerged slowly from the classroom. His expression unfath-omable, he returned to the party. Harry remained on the floor, hid-den beneath the cloak, his mind racing. \n",

            ": The Hour of Gaunt For or the rest of the week's Potions lessons Harry continued to follow the Half-Blood Prince's instructions wherever they deviated from Libatius Borage's, with the result that by their fourth lesson Slughorn was raving about Harrys abilities, saying that he had rarely taught anyone so talented. Neither Ron nor Hermione was delighted by this. Although Harry had offered to share his book with both of them, Ron had more difficulty deciphering the handwriting than Harry did, and could not keep asking Harry to read aloud or it might look suspicious. Hermione, meanwhile, was resolutely plowing on with what she called the \"official\" instructions, but becoming increasingly bad-tempered as they yielded poorer results than the Prince's. Harry wondered vaguely who the Half-Blood Prince had been. Although the amount of homework they had been given prevented him from reading the whole of his copy of Advanced Potion-Making, he had skimmed through it sufficiently to see that there was barely a page on which the Prince had not made additional notes, not all of them concerned with potion-making. Here and there were directions for what looked like spells that the Prince had made up himself. \"Or herself,\" said Hermione irritably, overhearing Harry pointing some of these out to Ron in the common room on Saturday evening. \"It might have been a girl. I think the handwriting looks more like a girl's than a boy's.\" \"The Half-Blood Prince, he was called,\" Harry said. \"How many girls have been Princes?\" Hermione seemed to have no answer to this. She merely scowled and twitched her essay on The Principles of Rematerialization away from Ron, who was trying to read it upside down. Harry looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old copy of Advanced Potion-Making back into his bag. \"It's five to eight, I'd better go, I'll be late for Dumbledore.\" \"Ooooh!\" gasped Hermione, looking up at once. \"Good luck! We'll wait up, we want to hear what he teaches you!\" \"Hope it goes okay,\" said Ron, and the pair of them watched Harry leave through the portrait hole. Harry proceeded through deserted corridors, though he had to step hastily behind a statue when Professor Trelawney appeared around a corner, muttering to herself as she shuffled a pack of dirty-looking playing cards, reading them as she walked. \"Two of spades: conflict,\" she murmured, as she passed the place where Harry crouched, hidden. \"Seven of spades: an ill omen. Ten of spades: violence. Knave of spades: a dark young man, possibly troubled, one who dislikes the questioner --\" She stopped dead, right on the other side of Harry's statue. \"Well, that can't be right,\" she said, annoyed, and Harry heard her reshuffling vigorously as she set off again, leaving nothing but a whiff of cooking sherry behind her. Harry waited until he was quite sure she had gone, then hurried off again until he reached the spot in the seventh-floor corridor where a single gargoyle stood against the wall. \"Acid Pops,\" said Harry, and the gargoyle leapt aside; the wall behind it slid apart, and a moving spiral stone staircase was revealed, onto which Harry stepped, so that he was carried in smooth circles up to the door with the brass knocker that led to Dumbledore's Office. Harry knocked. \"Come in,\" said Dumbledore s voice. \"Good evening, sir,\" said Harry, walking into the headmaster's office. \"Ah, good evening, Harry. Sit down,\" said Dumbledore, smiling. \"I hope you've had an enjoyable first week back at school?\" \"Yes, thanks, sir,\" said Harry. \"You must have been busy, a detention under your belt already!\" \"Er,\" began Harry awkwardly, but Dumbledore did not look too stern. \"I have arranged with Professor Snape that you will do your detention next Saturday instead.\" \"Right,\" said Harry, who had more pressing matters on his mind than Snapes detention, and now looked around surreptitiously for some indication of what Dumbledore was planning to do with him this evening. The circular office looked just as it always did; the delicate silver instruments stood on spindle-legged tables, puff-ing smoke and whirring; portraits of previous headmasters and headmistresses dozed in their frames, and Dumbledore's magnificent phoenix, Fawkes, stood on his perch behind the door, watching Harry with bright interest. It did not even look as though Dumbledore had cleared a space for dueling practice. \"So, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, in a businesslike voice. \"You have been wondering, I am sure, what I have planned for you during these -- for want of a better word -- lessons?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Well, I have decided that it is time, now that you know what prompted Lord Voldemort to try and kill you fifteen years ago, for you to be given certain information.\" There was a pause. \"You said, at the end of last term, you were going to tell me everything,\" said Harry. It was hard to keep a note of accusation from his voice. \"Sir,\" he added. \"And so I did,\" said Dumbledore placidly. \"I told you everything I know. From this point forth, we shall be leaving the firm foundation of fact and journeying together through the murky marshes of memory into thickets of wildest guesswork. From here on in, Harry, I may be as woefully wrong as Humphrey Belcher, who believed the time was ripe for a cheese cauldron.\" \"But you think you're right?\" said Harry. \"Naturally I do, but as I have already proven to you, I make mistakes like the next man. In fact, being -- forgive me -- rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.\" \"Sir,\" said Harry tentatively, \"does what you're going to tell me have anything to do with the prophecy? Will it help me . . . survive?\" \"It has a very great deal to do with the prophecy,\" said Dumbledore, as casually as if Harry had asked him about the next days weather, \"and I certainly hope that it will help you to survive.\" Dumbledore got to his feet and walked around the desk, past Harry, who turned eagerly in his seat to watch Dumbledore bending over the cabinet beside the door. When Dumbledore straightened up, he was holding a familiar shallow stone basin etched with odd markings around its rim. He placed the Pensieve on the desk in front of Harry. \"You look worried.\" Harry had indeed been eyeing the Pensieve with some apprehension. His previous experiences with the odd device that stored and revealed thoughts and memories, though highly instructive, had also been uncomfortable. The last time he had disturbed its contents, he had seen much more than he would have wished. But Dumbledore was smiling. \"This time, you enter the Pensieve with me . . . and, even more unusually, with permission.\" \"Where are we going, sir?\" \"For a trip down Bob Ogden's memory lane,\" said Dumbledore, pulling from his pocket a crystal bottle containing a swirling silvery-white substance. \"Who was Bob Ogden?\" \"He was employed by the Department of Magical Law Enforcement,\" said Dumbledore. \"He died some time ago, but not before I had tracked him down and persuaded him to confide these recollections to me. We are about to accompany him on a visit he made in the course of his duties. If you will stand, Harry ...\" But Dumbledore was having difficulty pulling out the stopper of the crystal bottle: His injured hand seemed stiff and painful. \"Shall --shall I, sir?\" \"No matter, Harry --\" Dumbledore pointed his wand at the bottle and the cork flew out. \"Sir -- how did you injure your hand?\" Harry asked again, looking at the blackened fingers with a mixture of revulsion and pity. \"Now is not the moment for that story, Harry. Not yet. We have an appointment with Bob Ogden.\" Dumbledore tipped the silvery contents of the bottle into the Pensieve, where they swirled and shimmered, neither liquid nor gas. \"After you,\" said Dumbledore, gesturing toward the bowl. Harry bent forward, took a deep breath, and plunged his face into the silvery substance. He felt his feet leave the office floor; he was falling, falling through whirling darkness and then, quite sud-denly, he was blinking in dazzling sunlight. Before his eyes had adjusted, Dumbledore landed beside him. They were standing in a country lane bordered by high, tangled hedgerows, beneath a summer sky as bright and blue as a forget-me-not. Some ten feet in front of them stood a short, plump man wearing enormously thick glasses that reduced his eyes to molelike specks. He was reading a wooden signpost that was sticking out of the brambles on the left-hand side of the road. Harry knew this must be Ogden; he was the only person in sight, and he was also wearing the strange assortment of clothes so often chosen by inexperienced wizards trying to look like Muggles: in this case, a frock coat and spats over a striped one-piece bathing costume. Before Harry had time to do more than register his bizarre appearance, however, Ogden had set off at a brisk walk down the lane. Dumbledore and Harry followed. As they passed the wooden sign, Harry looked up at its two arms. The one pointing back the way they had come read: Great Hangleton, 5 miles. The arm pointing after Ogden said Little Hangleton, 1 mile. They walked a short way with nothing to see but the hedgerows, the wide blue sky overhead and the swishing, frock-coated figure ahead. Then the lane curved to the left and fell away, sloping steeply down a hillside, so that they had a sudden, unexpected view of a whole valley laid out in front of them. Harry could see a village, undoubtedly Little Hangleton, nestled between two steep hills, its church and graveyard clearly visible. Across the valley, set on the opposite hillside, was a handsome manor house surrounded by a wide expanse of velvety green lawn. Ogden had broken into a reluctant trot due to the steep downward slope. Dumbledore lengthened his stride, and Harry hurried to keep up. He thought Little Hangleton must be their final destination and wondered, as he had done on the night they had found Slughorn, why they had to approach it from such a distance. He soon discovered that he was mistaken in thinking that they were going to the village, however. The lane curved to the right and when they rounded the corner, it was to see the very edge of Ogden's frock coat vanishing through a gap in the hedge. Dumbledore and Harry followed him onto a narrow dirt track bordered by higher and wilder hedgerows than those they had left behind. The path was crooked, rocky, and potholed, sloping down-hill like the last one, and it seemed to be heading for a patch of dark trees a little below them. Sure enough, the track soon opened up at the copse, and Dumbledore and Harry came to a halt behind Ogden, who had stopped and drawn his wand. Despite the cloudless sky, the old trees ahead cast deep, dark, cool shadows, and it was a few seconds before Harry's eyes discerned the building half-hidden amongst the tangle of trunks. It seemed to him a very strange location to choose for a house, or else an odd decision to leave the trees growing nearby, blocking all light and the view of the valley below. He wondered whether it was inhabited; its walls were mossy and so many tiles had fallen off the roof that the rafters were visible in places. Nettles grew all around it, their tips reaching the windows, which were tiny and thick with grime. Just as he had concluded that nobody could possibly live there, however, one of the windows was thrown open with a clatter, and a thin trickle of steam or smoke issued from it, as though somebody was cooking. Ogden moved forward quietly and, it seemed to Harry, rather cautiously. As the dark shadows of the trees slid over him, he stopped again, staring at the front door, to which somebody had nailed a dead snake. Then there was a rustle and a crack, and a man in rags dropped from the nearest tree, landing on his feet right in front of Ogden, who leapt backward so fast he stood on the tails of his frock coat and stumbled. \"You're not welcome.\" The man standing before them had thick hair so matted with dirt it could have been any color. Several of his teeth were missing. His eyes were small and dark and stared in opposite directions. He might have looked comical, but he did not; the effect was frighten-ing, and Harry could not blame Ogden for backing away several more paces before he spoke. \"Er -- good morning. I'm from the Ministry of Magic --\" \"You're not welcome.\" \"Er -- I'm sorry -- I don't understand you,\" said Ogden nervously. Harry thought Ogden was being extremely dim; the stranger was making himself very clear in Harry's opinion, particularly as he was brandishing a wand in one hand and a short and rather bloody knife in the other. \"You understand him, I'm sure, Harry?\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"Yes, of course,\" said Harry, slightly nonplussed. \"Why can't Ogden -- ?\" But as his eyes found the dead snake on the door again, he suddenly understood. \"He's speaking Parseltongue?\" \"Very good,\" said Dumbledore, nodding and smiling. The man in rags was now advancing on Ogden, knife in one hand, wand in the other. \"Now, look --\" Ogden began, but too late: There was a bang, and Ogden was on the ground, clutching his nose, while a nasty yellowish goo squirted from between his fingers. \"Morfin!\" said a loud voice. An elderly man had come hurrying out of the cottage, banging the door behind him so that the dead snake swung pathetically. This man was shorter than the first, and oddly proportioned; his shoulders were very broad and his arms overlong, which, with his bright brown eyes, short scrubby hair, and wrinkled face, gave him the look of a powerful, aged monkey. He came to a halt beside the man with the knife, who was now cackling with laughter at the sight of Ogden on the ground. \"Ministry, is it?\" said the older man, looking down at Ogden. \"Correct!\" said Ogden angrily, dabbing his face. \"And you, I take it, are Mr. Gaunt?\" \"S'right,\" said Gaunt. \"Got you in the face, did he?\" \"Yes, he did!\" snapped Ogden. \"Should've made your presence known, shouldn't you?\" said Gaunt aggressively. \"This is private property. Can't just walk in here and not expect my son to defend himself.\" \"Defend himself against what, man?\" said Ogden, clambering back to his feet. \"Busybodies. Intruders. Muggles and filth.\" Ogden pointed his wand at his own nose, which was still issuing large amounts of what looked like yellow pus, and the flow stopped at once. Mr. Gaunt spoke out of the corner of his mouth to Morfin. \"Get in the house. Don't argue.\" This time, ready for it, Harry recognized Parseltongue; even while he could understand what was being said, he distinguished the weird hissing noise that was all Ogden could hear. Morfin seemed to be on the point of disagreeing, but when his father cast him a threatening look he changed his mind, lumbering away to the cottage with an odd rolling gait and slamming the front door behind him, so that the snake swung sadly again. \"It's your son I'm here to see, Mr. Gaunt,\" said Ogden, as he mopped the last of the pus from the front of his coat. \"That was Morfin, wasn't it?\" \"Ah, that was Morfin,\" said the old man indifferently. \"Are you pure-blood?\" he asked, suddenly aggressive. \"That's neither here nor there,\" said Ogden coldly, and Harry felt his respect for Ogden rise. Apparently Gaunt felt rather differently. He squinted into Ogden’s face and muttered, in what was clearly supposed to be an offensive tone, \"Now I come to think about it, I've seen noses like yours down in the village.\" \"I don't doubt it, if your son’s been let loose on them,\" said Ogden. \"Perhaps we could continue this discussion inside?\" \"Inside?\" \"Yes, Mr. Gaunt. I've already told you. I'm here about Morfin. We sent an owl --\" \"I've no use for owls,\" said Gaunt. \"I don't open letters.\" \"Then you can hardly complain that you get no warning of visitors,\" said Ogden tartly. \"I am here following a serious breach of Wizarding law, which occurred here in the early hours of this morning --\" \"All right, all right, all right!\" bellowed Gaunt. \"Come in the bleeding house, then, and much good it'll do you!\" The house seemed to contain three tiny rooms. Two doors led off the main room, which served as kitchen and living room com-bined. Morfin was sitting in a filthy armchair beside the smoking fire, twisting a live adder between his thick fingers and crooning softly at it in Parseltongue: Hissy, hissy, little snakey, Slither on the floor You be good to Morfin Or he'll nail you to the door. There was a scuffling noise in the corner beside the open window, and Harry realized that there was somebody else in the room, a girl whose ragged gray dress was the exact color of the dirty stone wall behind her. She was standing beside a steaming pot on a grimy black stove, and was fiddling around with the shelf of squalid-looking pots and pans above it. Her hair was lank and dull and she had a plain, pale, rather heavy face. Her eyes, like her brother's, stared in opposite directions. She looked a little cleaner than the two men, but Harry thought he had never seen a more defeated-looking person. \"M'daughter, Merope,\" said Gaunt grudgingly, as Ogden looked inquiringly toward her. \"Good morning,\" said Ogden. She did not answer, but with a frightened glance at her father turned her back on the room and continued shifting the pots on the shelf behind her. \"Well, Mr. Gaunt,\" said Ogden, \"to get straight to the point, we have reason to believe that your son, Morfin, performed magic in front of a Muggle late last night.\" There was a deafening clang. Merope had dropped one of the pots. \"Pick it up!\" Gaunt bellowed at her. \"That's it, grub on the floor like some filthy Muggle, what's your wand for, you useless sack of muck?\" \"Mr. Gaunt, please!\" said Ogden in a shocked voice, as Merope, who had already picked up the pot, flushed blotchily scarlet, lost her grip on the pot again, drew her wand shakily from her pocket, pointed it at the pot, and muttered a hasty, inaudible spell that caused the pot to shoot across the floor away from her, hit the opposite wall, and crack in two. Morfin let out a mad cackle of laughter. Gaunt screamed, \"Mend it, you pointless lump, mend it!\" Merope stumbled across the room, but before she had time to raise her wand, Ogden had lifted his own and said firmly, \"Reparo. \" The pot mended itself instantly. Gaunt looked for a moment as though he was going to shout at Ogden, but seemed to think better of it: Instead, he jeered at his daughter, \"Lucky the nice man from the Ministry's here, isn't it? Perhaps he'll take you off my hands, perhaps he doesn't mind dirty Squibs. . . .\" Without looking at anybody or thanking Ogden, Merope picked up the pot and returned it, hands trembling, to its shelf. She then stood quite still, her back against the wall between the filthy window and the stove, as though she wished for nothing more than to sink into the stone and vanish. \"Mr. Gaunt,\" Ogden began again, \"as I've said: the reason for my visit --\" \"I heard you the first time!\" snapped Gaunt. \"And so what? Morfin gave a Muggle a bit of what was coming to him -- what about it, then?\" \"Morfin has broken Wizarding law,\" said Ogden sternly. \"'Morfin has broken Wizarding law.'\" Gaunt imitated Ogden’s voice, making it pompous and singsong. Morfin cackled again. \"He taught a filthy Muggle a lesson, that's illegal now, is it?\" \"Yes,\" said Ogden. \"I'm afraid it is.\" He pulled from an inside pocket a small scroll of parchment and unrolled it. \"What's that, then, his sentence?\" said Gaunt, his voice rising angrily. \"It is a summons to the Ministry for a hearing --\" \"Summons! Summons? Who do you think you are, summoning my son anywhere?\" \"I'm Head of the Magical Law Enforcement Squad,\" said Ogden. \"And you think we're scum, do you?\" screamed Gaunt, advancing on Ogden now, with a dirty yellow-nailed finger pointing at his chest. \"Scum who'll come running when the Ministry tells 'em to? Do you know who you're talking to, you filthy little Mudblood, do you?\" \"I was under the impression that I was speaking to Mr. Gaunt,\" said Ogden, looking wary, but standing his ground. \"That's right!\" roared Gaunt. For a moment, Harry thought Gaunt was making an obscene hand gesture, but then realized that he was showing Ogden the ugly, black-stoned ring he was wearing on his middle finger, waving it before Ogden's eyes. \"See this? See this? Know what it is? Know where it came from? Centuries it's been in our family, that's how far back we go, and pure-blood all the way! Know how much I've been offered for this, with the Peverell coat of arms engraved on the stone?\" \"I've really no idea,\" said Ogden, blinking as the ring sailed within an inch of his nose, \"and it's quite beside the point, Mr. Gaunt. Your son has committed --\" With a howl of rage, Gaunt ran toward his daughter. For a split second, Harry thought he was going to throttle her as his hand flew to her throat; next moment, he was dragging her toward Ogden by a gold chain around her neck. \"See this?\" he bellowed at Ogden, shaking a heavy gold locket at him, while Merope spluttered and gasped for breath. \"I see it, I see it!\" said Ogden hastily. \"Slytherins!\" yelled Gaunt. \"Salazar Slytherin's! We're his last living descendants, what do you say to that, eh?\" \"Mr. Gaunt, your daughter!\" said Ogden in alarm, but Gaunt had already released Merope; she staggered away from him, back to her corner, massaging her neck and gulping for air. \"So!\" said Gaunt triumphantly, as though he had just proved a complicated point beyond all possible dispute. \"Don't you go talking to us as if we're dirt on your shoes! Generations of purebloods, wizards all -- more than you can say, I don't doubt!\" And he spat on the floor at Ogdens feet. Morfin cackled again. Merope, huddled beside the window, her head bowed and her face hidden by her lank hair, said nothing. \"Mr. Gaunt,\" said Ogden doggedly, \"I am afraid that neither your ancestors nor mine have anything to do with the matter in hand. I am here because of Morfin, Morfin and the Muggle he accosted late last night. Our information\" -- he glanced down at his scroll of parchment -- \"is that Morfin performed a jinx or hex on the said Muggle, causing him to erupt in highly painful hives.\" Morfin giggled. \"Be quiet, boy,\" snarled Gaunt in Parseltongue, and Morfin fell silent again. \"And so what if he did, then?\" Gaunt said defiantly to Ogden, \"I expect you've wiped the Muggle's filthy face clean for him, and his memory to boot--\" \"That's hardly the point, is it, Mr. Gaunt?\" said Ogden. \"This was an unprovoked attack on a defenseless --\" \"Ar, I had you marked out as a Muggle-lover the moment I saw you,\" sneered Gaunt, and he spat on the floor again. \"This discussion is getting us nowhere,\" said Ogden firmly. \"It is clear from your son's attitude that he feels no remorse for his actions.\" He glanced down at his scroll of parchment again. \"Morfin will attend a hearing on the fourteenth of September to answer the charges of using magic in front of a Muggle and causing harm and distress to that same Mugg --\" Ogden broke off. The jingling, clopping sounds of horses and loud, laughing voices were drifting in through the open window. Apparently the winding lane to the village passed very close to the copse where the house stood. Gaunt froze, listening, his eyes wide. Morfin hissed and turned his face toward the sounds, his expression hungry. Merope raised her head. Her face, Harry saw, was starkly white. \"My God, what an eyesore!\" rang out a girl's voice, as clearly audible through the open window as if she had stood in the room beside them. \"Couldn't your father have that hovel cleared away, Tom?\" \"It's not ours,\" said a young man's voice. \"Everything on the other side of the valley belongs to us, but that cottage belongs to an old tramp called Gaunt, and his children. The son's quite mad, you should hear some of the stories they tell in the village --\" The girl laughed. The jingling, clopping noises were growing louder and louder. Morfin made to get out of his armchair. \"Keep your seat,\" said his father warningly, in Parseltongue. \"Tom,\" said the girl's voice again, now so close they were clearly right beside the house, \"I might be wrong -- but has somebody nailed a snake to that door?\" \"Good lord, you're right!\" said the man's voice. \"That'll be the son, I told you he's not right in the head. Don't look at it, Cecilia, darling.\" The jingling and clopping sounds were now growing faint again. \"'Darling,'\" whispered Morfin in Parseltongue, looking at his sister. \"'Darling, he called her. So he wouldn't have you anyway.\" Merope was so white Harry felt sure she was going to faint. \"What's that?\" said Gaunt sharply, also in Parseltongue, looking from his son to his daughter. \"What did you say, Morfin?\" \"She likes looking at that Muggle,\" said Morfin, a vicious expression on his face as he stared at his sister, who now looked terrified. \"Always in the garden when he passes, peering through the hedge at him, isn't she? And last night -- \" Merope shook her head jerkily, imploringly, but Morfin went on ruthlessly, \"Hanging out of the window waiting for him to ride home, wasn't she?\" \"Hanging out of the window to look at a Muggle?\" said Gaunt quietly. All three of the Gaunts seemed to have forgotten Ogden, who was looking both bewildered and irritated at this renewed outbreak of incomprehensible hissing and rasping. \"Is it true?\" said Gaunt in a deadly voice, advancing a step or two toward the terrified girl. \"My daughter--pure-blooded descendant of Salazar Slytherin -- hankering after a filthy, dirt-veined Muggle?\" Merope shook her head frantically, pressing herself into the wall, apparently unable to speak. \"But I got him, Father!\" cackled Morfin. \"I got him as he went by and he didn't look so pretty with hives all over him, did he, Merope?\" \"You disgusting little Squib, you filthy little blood traitor!\" roared Gaunt, losing control, and his hands closed around his daughter's throat. Both Harry and Ogden yelled \"No!\" at the same time; Ogden raised his wand and cried, \"Relaskio!\" Gaunt was thrown backward, away from his daughter; he tripped over a chair and fell flat on his back. With a roar of rage, Morfin leapt out of his chair and ran at Ogden, brandishing his bloody knife and firing hexes indiscriminately from his wand. Ogden ran for his life. Dumbledore indicated that they ought to follow and Harry obeyed, Merope's screams echoing in his ears. Ogden hurtled up the path and erupted onto the main lane, his arms over his head, where he collided with the glossy chestnut horse ridden by a very handsome, dark-haired young man. Both he and the pretty girl riding beside him on a gray horse roared with laughter at the sight of Ogden, who bounced off the horse's flank and set off again, his frock coat flying, covered from head to foot in dust, running pell-mell up the lane. \"I think that will do, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. He took Harry by the elbow and tugged. Next moment, they were both soaring weightlessly through darkness, until they landed squarely on their feet, back in Dumbledore's now twilit office. \"What happened to the girl in the cottage?\" said Harry at once, as Dumbledore lit extra lamps with a flick of his wand. \"Merope, or whatever her name was?\" \"Oh, she survived,\" said Dumbledore, reseating himself behind his desk and indicating that Harry should sit down too. \"Ogden Apparated back to the Ministry and returned with reinforcements within fifteen minutes. Morfin and his father attempted to fight, but both were overpowered, removed from the cottage, and subsequently convicted by the Wizengamot. Morfin, who already had a record of Muggle attacks, was sentenced to three years in Azkaban. Marvolo, who had injured several Ministry employees in addition to Ogden, received six months.\" \"Marvolo?\" Harry repeated wonderingly. \"That's right,\" said Dumbledore, smiling in approval. \"I am glad to see you're keeping up.\" \"That old man was -- ?\" \"Voldemort's grandfather, yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"Marvolo, his son, Morfin, and his daughter, Merope, were the last of the Gaunts, a very ancient Wizarding family noted for a vein of instability and violence that flourished through the generations due to their habit of marrying their own cousins. Lack of sense coupled with a great liking for grandeur meant that the family gold was squandered several generations before Marvolo was born. He, as you saw, was left in squalor and poverty, with a very nasty temper, a fantastic amount of arrogance and pride, and a couple of family heirlooms that he treasured just as much as his son, and rather more than his daughter.\" \"So Merope,\" said Harry, leaning forward in his chair and star-ing at Dumbledore, \"so Merope was . . . Sir, does that mean she was . . . Voldemort's mother?\" \"It does,\" said Dumbledore. \"And it so happens that we also had a glimpse of Voldemort's father. I wonder whether you noticed?\" \"The Muggle Morfin attacked? The man on the horse?\" \"Very good indeed,\" said Dumbledore, beaming. \"Yes, that was Tom Riddle senior, the handsome Muggle who used to go riding past the Gaunt cottage and for whom Merope Gaunt cherished a secret, burning passion.\" \"And they ended up married?\" Harry said in disbelief, unable to imagine two people less likely to fall in love. \"I think you are forgetting,\" said Dumbledore, \"that Merope was a witch. I do not believe that her magical powers appeared to their best advantage when she was being terrorized by her father. Once Marvolo and Morfin were safely in Azkaban, once she was alone and free for the first time in her life, then, I am sure, she was able to give full rein to her abilities and to plot her escape from the desperate life she had led for eighteen years.\" \"Can you not think of any measure Merope could have taken to make Tom Riddle forget his Muggle companion, and fall in love with her instead?\" \"The Imperius Curse?\" Harry suggested. \"Or a love potion?\" \"Very good. Personally, I am inclined to think that she used a love potion. I am sure it would have seemed more romantic to her, and I do not think it would have been very difficult, some hot day, when Riddle was riding alone, to persuade him to take a drink of water. In any case, within a few months of the scene we have just witnessed, the village of Little Hangleton enjoyed a tremendous scandal. You can imagine the gossip it caused when the squire's son ran off with the tramp's daughter, Merope.\" \"But the villagers' shock was nothing to Marvolo's. He returned from Azkaban, expecting to find his daughter dutifully awaiting his return with a hot meal ready on his table. Instead, he found a clear inch of dust and her note of farewell, explaining what she had done.\" \"From all that I have been able to discover, he never mentioned her name or existence from that time forth. The shock of her desertion may have contributed to his early death -- or perhaps he had simply never learned to feed himself. Azkaban had greatly weakened Marvolo, and he did not live to see Morfin return to the cottage.\" \"And Merope? She ... she died, didn't she? Wasn't Voldemort brought up in an orphanage?\" \"Yes, indeed,\" said Dumbledore. \"We must do a certain amount of guessing here, although I do not think it is difficult to deduce what happened. You see, within a few months of their runaway marriage, Tom Riddle reappeared at the manor house in Little Hangleton without his wife. The rumor flew around the neighborhood that he was talking of being 'hoodwinked' and 'taken in.' What he meant, I am sure, is that he had been under an enchantment that had now lifted, though I daresay he did not dare use those precise words for fear of being thought insane. When they heard what he was saying, however, the villagers guessed that Merope had lied to Tom Riddle, pretending that she was going to have his baby, and that he had married her for this reason.\" \"But she did have his baby.\" \"But not until a year after they were married. Tom Riddle left her while she was still pregnant.\" \"What went wrong?\" asked Harry. \"Why did the love potion stop working?\" \"Again, this is guesswork,\" said Dumbledore, \"but I believe that Merope, who was deeply in love with her husband, could not bear to continue enslaving him by magical means. I believe that she made the choice to stop giving him the potion. Perhaps, besotted as she was, she had convinced herself that he would by now have fallen in love with her in return. Perhaps she thought he would stay for the baby's sake. If so, she was wrong on both counts. He left her, never saw her again, and never troubled to discover what became of his son.\" The sky outside was inky black and the lamps in Dumbledore's office seemed to glow more brightly than before. \"I think that will do for tonight, Harry,\" said Dumbledore after a moment or two. \"Yes, sir,\" said Harry. He got to his feet, but did not leave. \"Sir ... is it important to know all this about Voldemort's past?\" \"Very important, I think,\" said Dumbledore. \"And it... it's got something to do with the prophecy?\" \"It has everything to do with the prophecy.\" \"Right,\" said Harry, a little confused, but reassured all the same. He turned to go, then another question occurred to him, and he turned back again. \"Sir, am I allowed to tell Ron and Hermione everything you've told me?\" Dumbledore considered him for a moment, then said, \"Yes, I think Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger have proved themselves trust-worthy. But Harry, I am going to ask you to ask them not to repeat any of this to anybody else. It would not be a good idea if word got around how much I know, or suspect, about Lord Voldemort's secrets.\" \"No, sir, I'll make sure it's just Ron and Hermione. Good night.\" He turned away again, and was almost at the door when he saw it. Sitting on one of the little spindle-legged tables that supported so many frail-looking silver instruments, was an ugly gold ring set with a large, cracked, black stone. \"Sir,\" said Harry, staring at it. \"That ring--\" \"Yes?\" said Dumbledore. \"You were wearing it when we visited Professor Slughorn that night.\" \"So I was,\" Dumbledore agreed. \"But isn't it... sir, isn't it the same ring Marvolo Gaunt showed Ogden?\" Dumbledore bowed his head. \"The very same.\" \"But how come -- ? Have you always had it?\" \"No, I acquired it very recently,\" said Dumbledore. \"A few days before I came to fetch you from your aunt and uncle's, in fact.\" \"That would be around the time you injured your hand, then, sir?\" \"Around that time, yes, Harry.\" Harry hesitated. Dumbledore was smiling. \"Sir, how exactly -- ?\" \"Too late, Harry! You shall hear the story another time. Good night.\" \"Good night, sir.\" \n",

            ": The Half-Blood Prince Harry and Ron met Hermione in the common room before breakfast next morning. Hoping for some support in his theory, Harry lost no time in telling Hermione what he had overheard Malfoy saying on the Hogwarts Express. \"But he was obviously showing off for Parkinson, wasn't he?\" interjected Ron quickly, before Hermione could say anything. \"Well,\" she said uncertainly, \"I don't know. It would be like Malfoy to make himself seem more important than he is ... but that's a big lie to tell...\" \"Exactly,\" said Harry, but he could nor press the point, because so many people were trying to listen in to his conversation, not to mention staring at him and whispering behind their hands. \"It's rude to point,\" Ron snapped at a particularly minuscule first-year boy as they joined the queue to climb out of the portrait hole. The boy, who had been muttering something about Harry behind his hand to his friend, promptly turned scarlet and toppled out of the hole in alarm. Ron sniggered. \"I love being a sixth year. And were going to be getting free time this year. Whole periods when we can just sit up here and relax.\" \"We're going to need that time for studying, Ron!\" said Hermione, as they set off down the corridor. \"Yeah, but not today,\" said Ron. \"Today's going to be a real loss, I reckon.\" \"Hold it!\" said Hermione, throwing out an arm and halting a passing fourth year, who was attempting to push past her with a lime-green disk clutched tightly in his hand. \"Fanged Frisbees banned, hand it over,\" she told him sternly. The scowling boy handed over the snarling Frisbee, ducked under her arm, and took off after his friends. Ron waited for him to vanish, then tugged the Frisbee from Hermione's grip. \"Excellent, I've always wanted one of these.\" Hermione's remonstration was drowned by a loud giggle; Lavender Brown had apparently found Ron's remark highly amusing. She continued to laugh as she passed them, glancing back at Ron over her shoulder. Ron looked rather pleased with himself. The ceiling of the Great Hall was serenely blue and streaked with frail, wispy clouds, just like the squares of sky visible through the high mullioned windows. While they tucked into porridge and eggs and bacon, Harry and Ron told Hermione about their embarassing conversation with Hagrid the previous evening. \"But he can't really think we'd continue Care of Magical Creatures!\" she said, looking distressed. \"I mean, when has any of us expressed . . . you know . . . any enthusiasm?\" \"That's it, though, innit?\" said Ron, swallowing an entire fried egg whole. \"We were the ones who made the most effort in classes because we like Hagrid. But he thinks we liked the stupid subject. D'ya reckon anyone's going to go on to N.E.W.T.?\" Neither Harry nor Hermione answered; there was no need. They knew perfectly well that nobody in their year would want to continue Care of Magical Creatures. They avoided Hagrid's eye and returned his cheery wave only half-heartedly when he left the staff table ten minutes later. After they had eaten, they remained in their places, awaiting Professor McGonagall's descent from the staff table. The distribution of class schedules was more complicated than usual this year, for Professor McGonagall needed first to confirm that everybody had achieved the necessary O.W.L. grades to continue with their chosen N.E.W.T.s. Hermione was immediately cleared to continue with Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Herbology, Arithmancy, Ancient Runes, and Potions, and shot off to a first period Ancient Runes class without further ado. Neville took a little longer to sort out; his round face was anxious as Professor McGonagall looked down his application and then consulted his O.W.L results. \"Herbology, fine,\" she said. \"Professor Sprout will be delighted to see you back with an 'Outstanding' O.W.L. And you qualify for Defense Against the Dark Arts with 'Exceeds Expectations.' But the problem is Transfiguration. I'm sorry, Longbottom, but an 'Acceptable' really isn't good enough to continue to N.E.W.T. level. Just don't think you'd be able to cope with the coursework.\" Neville hung his head. Professor McGonagall peered at him through her square spectacles. \"Why do you want to continue with Transfiguration, anyway? I've never had the impression that you particularly enjoyed it.\" Neville looked miserable and muttered something about \"my grandmother wants.\" \"Hmph,\" snorted Professot McGonagall. \"It's high time your grandmother learned to be proud of the grandson she's got, rather than the one she thinks she ought to have - particularly after what happened at the Ministry.\" Neville turned very pink and blinked confusedly; Professor McGonagall had never paid him a compliment before. \"I'm sorry, Longbottom, but I cannot let you into my N.E.W.T. class. I see that you have an 'Exceeds Expectations' in Charm however - why not try for a N.E.W.T. in Charms?\" \"My grandmother thinks Charms is a soft option,\" mumbled Neville. \"Take Charms,\" said Professor McGonagall, \"and I shall drop Augusta a line reminding her that just because she failed her Charms O.W.L., the subject is not necessarily worthless.\" Smiling slightly at the look of delighted incredulity on Neville's face, Professor McGonagall tapped a blank schedule with the tip of her wand and handed it, now carrying details of his new classes, to Neville. Professor McGonagall turned next to Parvati Patil, whose first question was whether Firenze, the handsome centaur, was still teaching Divination. \"He and Professor Trelawney are dividing classes between them this year,\" said Professor McGonagall, a hint of disapproval in her voice; it was common knowledge that she despised the subject of Divination. \"The sixth year is being taken by Professor Trelawney.\" Parvati set off for Divination five minutes later looking slightly crestfallen. \"So, Potter, Potter . . .\" said Professor McGonagall, consulting her notes as she turned to Harry. \"Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Herbology, Transfiguration ... all fine. I must say, I was pleased with your Transfiguration mark, Potter, very pleased. Now, why haven't you applied to continue with Potions? I thought it was your ambition to become an Auror?\" \"It was, but you told me I had to get an 'Outstanding' in my O.W.L., Professor.\" \"And so you did when Professor Snape was teaching the subject. Professor Slughorn, however, is perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T. students with 'Exceeds Expectations' at O.W.L. Do you wish to proceed with Potions?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry, \"but I didn't buy the books or any ingredients or anything-\" \"I'm sure Professor Slughorn will be able to lend you some,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Very well, Potter, here is your schedule. Oh, by the way- twenty hopefuls have already put down their names for the Gryffindor Quidditch team. I shall pass the list to you in due course and you can fix up trials at your leisure.\" A few minutes later, Ron was cleared to do the same subjects as Harry, and the two of them left the table together. \"Look,\" said Ron delightedly, gazing ar his schedule, \"we've got a free period now. . . and a free period after break . . . and after lunch . . . excellent.\" They returned to the common room, which was empty apart from a half dozen seventh years, including Katie Bell, the only remaining member of the original Gryffindor Quidditch team that Harry had joined in his first year. \"I thought you'd get that, well done,\" she called over, pointing at the Captains badge on Harry's chest. \"Tell me when you call trials!\" \"Don't be stupid,\" said Harry, \"you don't need to try out, I watched you play for five years. . . .\" \"You mustn't start off like that,\" she said warningly. \"For all you know, there's someone much better than me out there. Good teams have been ruined before now because Captains just kept playing the old faces, or letting in their friends....\" Ron looked a little uncomfortable and began playing with the Fanged Frisbee Hermione had taken from the fourth-year student. It zoomed around the common room, snarling and attempting to take bites of the tapestry. Crookshanks's yellow eyes followed it and he hissed when it came too close. An hour later they reluctantly left the sunlit common room for the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom four floors below. Hermione was already queuing outside, carrying an armful of heavy books and looking put-upon. \"We got so much homework for Runes,\" she said anxiously when Harry and Ron joined her. \"A fifteen-inch essay, two translations, and I've got to read these by Wednesday!\" \"Shame,\" yawned Ron. \"You wait,\" she said resentfully. \"I bet Snape gives us loads.\" The classroom door opened as she spoke, and Snape stepped into the corridor, his sallow face framed as ever by two curtains of greasy black hair. Silence fell over the queue immediately. \"Inside,\" he said. Harry looked around as they entered. Snape had imposed his personality upon the room already; it was gloomier than usual, as curtains had been drawn over the windows, and was lit by candlelight. New pictures adorned the walls, many of them showing people who appeared to be in pain, sporting grisly injuries or strangely contorted body parts. Nobody spoke as they settled down, looking around at the shadowy, gruesome pictures. \"I have not asked you to take out your books,\" said Snape, closing the door and moving to face the class from behind his desk; Hermione hastily dropped her copy of Confronting the Faceless back into her bag and stowed it under her chair. \"I wish to speak to you, and I want your fullest attention.\" His black eyes roved over their upturned faces, lingering for a fraction of a second longer on Harry's than anyone else's. \"You have had five teachers in this subject so far, I believe.\" You believe . . . like you haven't watched them all come and go, hoping you'd be next, thought Harry scathingly. \"Naturally, these teachers will all have had their own methods and priorities. Given this confusion I am surprised so many of you scraped an O.W.L. in this subject. I shall be even more surprised if all of you manage to keep up with the N.E.W.T. work, which will be more advanced.\" Snape set off around the edge of the room, speaking now in a lower voice; the class craned their necks to keep him in view. \"The Dark Arts,\" said Snape, \"are many, varied, ever-changing, and eternal. Fighting them is like fighting a many-headed monster, which, each time a neck is severed, sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than before. You are fighting that which is unfixed, mutating, indestructible.\" Harry stared at Snape. It was surely one thing to respect the Dark Arts as a dangerous enemy, another to speak of them, as Snape was doing, with a loving caress in his voice? \"Your defenses,\" said Snape, a little louder, \"must therefore be as flexible and inventive as the arts you seek to undo. These pictures\" - he indicated a few of them as he swept past - \"give a fair representation of what happens to those who suffer, for instance, the Cruciatus Curse\" - he waved a hand toward a witch who was clearly shrieking in agony - \"feel the Dementor's Kiss\" - a wizard lying huddled and blank-eyed, slumped against a wall - \"or provoke the aggression of the Inferius\" - a bloody mass upon ground. \"Has an Inferius been seen, then?\" said Parvati Patil in a high pitched voice. \"Is it definite, is he using them?\" \"The Dark Lord has used Inferi in the past,\" said Snape, \"which means you would be well-advised to assume he might use them again. Now. . . \" He set off again around the other side of the classroom toward his desk, and again, they watched him as he walked, his dark robes billowing behind him. , \". . . you are, I believe, complete novices in the use of nonverbal spells. What is the advantage of a nonverbal spell?\" Hermione's hand shot into the air. Snape took his time looking around at everybody else, making sure he had no choice, before saying curtly, \"Very well - Miss Granger?\" \"Your adversary has no warning about what kind of magic you're about to perform,\" said Hermione, \"which gives you a split-second advantage.\" \"An answer copied almost word for word from The Standard Book of Spells, Grade Six,\" said Snape dismissively (over in the corner, Malfoy sniggered), \"but correct in essentials. Yes, those who progress in using magic without shouting incantations gain an element of surprise in their spell-casting. Not all wizards can do this, of course; it is a question of concentration and mind power which some\" - his gaze lingered maliciously upon Harry once more - \"lack.\" Harry knew Snape was thinking of their disastrous Occlumency lessons of the previous year. He refused to drop his gaze, but glowered at Snape until Snape looked away. \"You will now divide,\" Snape went on, \"into pairs. One partner will attempt to jinx the other without speaking. The other will attempt to repel the jinx in equal silence. Carry on.\" Although Snape did not know it, Harry had taught at least half the class (everyone who had been a member of the D.A.) how to perform a Shield Charm the previous year. None of them had ever cast the charm without speaking, however. A reasonable amount of cheating ensued; many people were merely whispering the incantation instead of saying it aloud. Typically, ten minutes into the lesson Hermione managed to repel Neville's muttered Jelly-Legs Jinx without uttering a single word, a feat that would surely have earned her twenty points for Gryffindor from any reasonable teacher, thought Harry bitterly, but which Snape ignored. He swept between them as they practiced, looking just as much like an overgrown bat as ever, lingering to watch Harry and Ron struggling with the task. Ron, who was supposed to be jinxing Harry, was purple in the face, his lips tightly compressed to save himself from the temptation of muttering the incantation. Harry had his wand raised, waiting on tenterhooks to repel a jinx that seemed unlikely ever to come. \"Pathetic, Weasley,\" said Snape, after a while. \"Here -- let me show you-\" He turned his wand on Harry so fast that Harry reacted instinctively; all thought of nonverbal spells forgotten, he yelled, \"Protego!\" His Shield Charm was so strong Snape was knocked off-balance and hit a desk. The whole class had looked around and now watched as Snape righted himself, scowling. \"Do you remember me telling you we are practicing nonverbal spells, Potter?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry stiffly. \"Yes, sir.\" \"There's no need to call me 'sir,' Professor.\" The words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying. Several people gasped, including Hermione. Behind Snape, however, Ron, Dean, and Seamus grinned appreciatively. \"Detention, Saturday night, my office,\" said Snape. \"I do not take cheek from anyone, Potter . . . not even 'the Chosen One.'\" \"That was brilliant, Harry!\" chortled Ron, once they were safely on their way to break a short while later. \"You really shouldn't have said it,\" said Hermione, frowning at Ron. \"What made you?\" \"He tried to jinx me, in case you didn't notice!\" fumed Harry. I had enough of that during those Occlumency lessons! Why doesn't he use another guinea pig for a change? What's Dumbledore playing at, anyway, letting him teach Defense? Did you hear him talking about the Dark Arts? He loves them! All that unfixed, indestructble stuff –\" \"Well,\" said Hermione, \"I thought he sounded a bit like you.\" \"Like me?\" \"Yes, when you were telling us what it's like to face Voldemort. You said it wasn't just memorizing a bunch of spells, you said it was just you and your brains and your guts - well, wasn't that what Snape was saying? That it really comes down to being brave and quick-thinking?\" Harry was so disarmed that she had thought his words as well worth memorizing as The Standard Book of Spells that he did not argue. \"Harry! Hey, Harry!\" Harry looked around; Jack Sloper, one of the Beaters on last year's Gryffindor Quidditch team, was hurrying toward him holding a roll of parchment. \"For you,\" panted Sloper. \"Listen, I heard you're the new Captain. When're you holding trials?\" \"I'm not sure yet,\" said Harry, thinking privately that Sloper would be very lucky to get back on the team. \"I'll let you know.\" \"Oh, right. I was hoping it'd be this weekend -\" \"But Harry was not listening; he had just recognized the thin, slanting writing on the parchment. Leaving Sloper in mid-sentence, he hurried away with Ron and Hermione, unrolling the parchment as he went. Dear Harry, I would like to start our private lessons this Saturday. Kindly come along to my office at 8 P.M. I hope you are enjoying your first day back at school. Yours sincerely, Albus Dumbledore P.S. I enjoy Acid Pops. \"He enjoys Acid Pops?\" said Ron, who had read the message over Harry's shoulder and was looking perplexed. \"It's the password to get past the gargoyle outside his study,\" said Harry in a low voice. \"Ha! Snape's not going to be pleased. . . . I won't be able to do his detention!\" He, Ron, and Hermione spent the whole of break speculating on what Dumbledore would teach Harry. Ron thought it most likely to be spectacular jinxes and hexes of the type the Death Eaters would not know. Hermione said such things were illegal, and thought it much more likely that Dumbledore wanted to teach Harry advanced Defensive magic. After break, she went off to Arithmancy while Harry and Ron returned to the common room where they grudgingly started Snape's homework. This turned out to be so complex that they still had not finished when Hermione joined them for their after-lunch free period (though she considerably speeded up the process). They had only just finished when the bell rang for the afternoon's double Potions and they beat the familiar path down to the dungeon classroom that had, for so long, been Snape's. When they arrived in the corridor they saw that there were only a dozen people progressing to N.E.W.T. level. Crabbe and Goyle had evidently failed to achieve the required O.W.L. grade, but four Slytherins had made it through, including Malfoy. Four Ravenclaws were there, and one Hufflepuff, Ernie Macmillan, whom Harry liked despite his rather pompous manner. \"Harry,\" Ernie said portentously, holding out his hand as Harry approached, \"didn't get a chance to speak in Defense Against The Dark Arts this morning. Good lesson, I thought, but Shield Charms are old hat, of course, for us old D.A. lags . . . And how are you, Ron -- Hermione?\" Before they could say more than \"fine,\" the dungeon door opened and Slughorn's belly preceded him out of the door. As they filed into the room, his great walrus mustache curved above his beaming mouth, and he greeted Harry and Zabini with particular enthusiasm. The dungeon was, most unusually, already full of vapors and odd smells. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sniffed interestedly as they passed large, bubbling cauldrons. The four Slytherins took a table together, as did the four Ravenclaws. This left Harry, Ron, and Hermione to share a table with Ernie. They chose the one nearest a gold-colored cauldron that was emitting one of the most seductive scents Harry had ever inhaled: Somehow it reminded him simultaneously of treacle tart, the woody smell of a broomstick handle, and something flowery he thought he might have smelled at the Burrow. He found that he was breathing very slowly and deeply and that the potion's fumes seemed to be filling him up like drink. A great contentment stole over him; he grinned across at Ron, who grinned back lazily. \"Now then, now then, now then,\" said Slughorn, whose massive outline was quivering through the many shimmering vapors. \"Scales out, everyone, and potion kits, and don't forget your copies of Advanced Potion-Making. . . .\" \"Sir?\" said Harry, raising his hand. \"Harry, m'boy?\" \"I haven't got a book or scales or anything - nor's Ron - we didn't realize we'd be able to do the N.E.W.T., you see -\" \"Ah, yes, Professor McGonagall did mention . . . not to worry, my dear boy, not to worry at all. You can use ingredients from the store cupboard today, and I'm sure we can lend you some scales, and we've got a small stock of old books here, they'll do until you can write to Flourish and Blotts. . . .\" Slughorn strode over to a corner cupboard and, after a moment's foraging, emerged with two very battered-looking copies of Advanced Potion-Making by Libatius Borage, which he gave to Harry and Ron along with two sets of tarnished scales. \"Now then,\" said Slughorn, returning to the front of the class and inflating his already bulging chest so that the buttons on his waistcoat threatened to burst off, \"I've prepared a few potions for you to have a look at, just out of interest, you know. These are the kind of thing you ought to be able to make after completing your N.E.W.T.s. You ought to have heard of 'em, even if you haven't made 'em yet. Anyone tell me what this one is?\" He indicated the cauldron nearest the Slytherin table. Harry raised himself slighty in his seat and saw what looked like plain water boiling away inside it. Hermione's well-practiced hand hit the air before anybody else's; Slughorn pointed at her. \"It's Veritaserum, a colorless, odorless potion thar forces the drinker to tell the truth,\" said Hermione. \"Very good, very good!\" said Slughorn happily. \"Now,\" he continued, pointing at the cauldron nearest the Ravenclaw table, \"this one here is pretty well known... Featured in a few Ministry leaflets lately too... Who can - ?\" Hermione's hand was fastest once more. \"lt's Polyjuice Potion, sir,\" she said. Harry too had recognized the slow-bubbling, mudlike substance the second cauldron, but did not resent Hermione getting the credit for answering the question; she, after all, was the one who had succeeded in making it, back in their second year. \"Excellent, excellent! Now, this one here . . . yes, my dear?\" said Slughorn, now looking slightly bemused, as Hermione's hand punched the air again. \"It's Amortentia!\" \"It is indeed. Ir seems almost foolish to ask,\" said Slughorn, who was looking mightily impressed, \"but I assume you know what it does?\" \"It's the most powerful love porion in the world!\" said Hermione. \"Quite right! You recognized it, I suppose, by its distinctive mother-of-pearl sheen?\" \"And the steam rising in characteristic spirals,\" said Hermione enthusiastically, \"and it's supposed to smell differently to each of according to what attracts us, and I can smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and -\" But she turned slightly pink and did not complete the sentence. 'May I ask your name, my dear?\" said Slughorn, ignoring Hermione's embarrassment. \"Hermione Granger, sir.\" \"Granger? Granger? Can you possibly be related to Hector Dagworth-Granger, who founded the Most Extraordinary Society of Potioneers?\" \"No. I don't think so, sir. I'm Muggle-born, you see.\" Harry saw Malfoy lean close to Nott and whisper something; both of them sniggered, but Slughorn showed no dismay; on the contrary, he beamed and looked from Hermione to Harry, who was sitting next to her. \"Oho! ‘One of my best friends is Muggle-born, and she's the best in our year!' I'm assuming this is the very friend of whom you spoke, Harry?\" \"Yes, sir,\" said Harry. \"Well, well, take twenty well-earned points for Gryffindor, Miss Granger,\" said Slughorn genially. Malfoy looked rather as he had done the time Hermione had punched him in the face. Hermione turned to Harry with a radiant expression and whispered, \"Did you really tell him I'm the best in the year? Oh, Harry!\" \"Well, what's so impressive about that?\" whispered Ron, who for some reason looked annoyed. \"You are the best in the year - I'd've told him so if he'd asked me!\" Hermione smiled but made a \"shhing\" gesture, so that they could hear what Slughorn was saying. Ron looked slightly disgruntled. \"Amortentia doesn't really create love, of course. It is impossible to manufacture or imitate love. No, this will simply cause a powerful infatuation or obsession. It is probably the most dangerous and powerful potion in this room - oh yes,\" he said, nodding gravely at Malfoy and Nott, both of whom were smirking skeptically. \"When you have seen as much of life as I have, you will not underestimate the power of obsessive love.\" \"And now,\" said Slughorn, \"it is time for us to start work.\" \"Sir, you haven't told us what's in this one,\" said Ernie Macmillan, pointing at a small black cauldron standing on Slughorn's desk. The potion within was splashing about merrily; it was the color of molten gold, and large drops were leaping like goldfish above the surface, though not a particle had spilled. \"Oho,\" said Slughorn again. Harry was sure that Slughorn had not forgotten the potion at all, but had waited to be asked for dramatic effect. \"Yes. That. Well, that one, ladies and gentlemen, is a most curious little potion called Felix Felicis. I take it,\" he turned, smiling, to look at Hermione, who had let out an audible gasp, \"that you know what Felix Felicis does, Miss Granger?\" \"It's liquid luck,\" said Hermione excitedly. \"It makes you lucky!\" The whole class seemed to sit up a little straighter. Now all Harry could see of Malfoy was the back of his sleek blond head, because he was at last giving Slughorn his full and undivided attention. \"Quite right, take another ten points for Gryffindor. Yes, it's a funny little potion, Felix Felicis,\" said Slughorn. \"Desperately tricky to make, and disastrous to get wrong. However, if brewed correctly, as this has been, you will find that all your endeavors tend to succeed ... at least until the effects wear off.\" \"Why don't people drink it all the time, sir?\" said Terry Boot eagerly. \"Because if taken in excess, it causes giddiness, recklessness, and dangerous overconfidence,\" said Slughorn. \"Too much of a good thing, you know. . . highly toxic in large quantities. But taken sparingly, and very occasionally . . .\" \"Have you ever taken it, sir?\" asked Michael Corner with great interest. \"Twice in my life,\" said Slughorn. \"Once when I was twenty-four, once when I was fifty-seven. Two tablespoonfuls taken with breakfast. Two perfect days.\" He gazed dreamily into the distance. Whether he was playacting or not, thought Harry, the effect was good. \"And that,\" said Slughorn, apparently coming back to earth, \"is what I shall be offering as a prize in this lesson.\" There was silence in which every bubble and gurgle of the surrounding potions seemed magnified tenfold. \"One tiny bottle of Felix Felicis,\" said Slughorn, taking a minuscule glass bottle with a cork in it out of his pocket and showing it to them all. \"Enough for twelve hours' luck. From dawn till dusk, you will be lucky in everything you attempt.\" \"Now, I must give you warning that Felix Felicis is a banned substance in organized competitions . . . sporting events, for instance, examinations, or elections. So the winner is to use it on an ordinary day only . . . and watch how that ordinary day becomes extraordinary!\" \"So,\" said Slughorn, suddenly brisk, \"how are you to win this fabulous prize? Well, by turning to page ten of Advanced Potion Making. We have a little over an hour left to us, which should be time for you to make a decent attempt at the Draught of Living Death. I know it is more complex than anything you have attempted before, and I do not expect a perfect potion from anybody. The person who does best, however, will win little Felix here. Off you go!\" There was a scraping as everyone drew their cauldrons toward them and some loud clunks as people began adding weights to their scales, but nobody spoke. The concentration within the room was almost tangible. Harry saw Malfoy riffling feverishly through his copy of Advanced Potion-Making., It could not have been clearer that Malfoy really wanted that lucky day. Harry bent swiftly over the tattered book Slughorn had lent him. To his annoyance he saw that the previous owner had scribbled all over the pages, so that the margins were as black as the printed portions. Bending low to decipher the ingredients (even here, the previous owner had made annotations and crossed things out) Harry hurried off toward the store cupboard to find what he needed. As he dashed back to his cauldron, he saw Malfoy cutting up Valerian roots as fast as he could. Everyone kept glancing around at what the rest of the class was doing; this was both an advantage and a disadvantage of Potions, that it was hard to keep your work private. Within ten minutes, the whole place was full of bluish steam. Hermione, of course, seemed to have progressed furthest. Her potion already resembled the \"smooth, black currant-colored liquid\" mentioned as the ideal halfway stage. Having finished chopping his roots, Harry bent low over his book again. It was really very irritating, having to try and decipher the directions under all the stupid scribbles of the previous owner, who for some reason had taken issue with the order to cut up the sopophorous bean and had written in the alternative instruction: Crush with flat side of silver dagger, releases juice better than cutting. \"Sir, I think you knew my grandfather, Abraxas Malfoy?\" Harry looked up; Slughorn was just passing the Slytherin table. \"Yes,\" said Slughorn, without looking at Malfoy, \"I was sorry to hear he had died, although of course it wasn't unexpected, dragon pox at his age...\" And he walked away. Harry bent back over his cauldron, smirking. He could tell that Malfoy had expected to be treated like Harry or Zabini; perhaps even hoped for some preferential treatment of the type he had learned to expect from Snape. It looked as though Malfoy would have to rely on nothing but talent to win the bottle of Felix Felicis. The sopophorous bean was proving very difficult to cut up. Harry turned to Hermione. \"Can I borrow your silver knife?\" She nodded impatiently, not taking her eyes off her potion, which was still deep purple, though according to the book ought to be turning a light shade of lilac by now. Harry crushed his bean with the flat side of the dagger. To his astonishment, it immediately exuded so much juice he was amazed the shriveled bean could have held it all. Hastily scooping it all into the cauldron he saw, to his surprise, that the potion immediately turned exactly the shade of lilac described by the textbook. His annoyance with the previous owner vanishing on the spot, Harry now squinted at the next line of instructions. According the book, he had to stir counterclockwise until the potion turned clear as water. According to the addition the previous owner made, however, he ought to add a clockwise stir after every seventh counterclockwise stir. Could the old owner be right twice? Harry stirred counterclockwise, held his breath, and stirred once clockwise. The effect was immediate. The potion turned pale pink. \"How are you doing that?\" demanded Hermione, who was redfaced and whose hair was growing bushier and bushier in the fumes from her cauldron; her potion was still resolutely purple. \"Add a clockwise stir -\" \"No, no, the book says counterclockwise!\" she snapped. Harry shrugged and continued what he was doing. Seven stirs counterdockwise, one clockwise, pause . . . seven stirs counterclockwise, one stir clockwise . . . Across the table, Ron was cursing fluently under his breath; his potion looked like liquid licorice. Harry glanced around. As far as he could see, no one else's potion had turned as pale as his. He felt elated, something that had certainly never happened before in this dungeon. \"And time's . . . up!\" called Slughorn. \"Stop stirring, please!\" Slughorn moved slowly among the tables, peering into cauldrons. He made no comment, but occasionally gave the potions a stir or a sniff. At last he reached the table where Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ernie were sitting. He smiled ruefully at the tarlike substance in Ron's cauldron. He passed over Ernie's navy concoction. Hermione's potion he gave an approving nod. Then he saw Harry's, and a look of incredulous delight spread over his face. \"The clear winner!\" he cried to the dungeon. \"Excellent, excellent, Harry! Good lord, it's clear you've inherited your mother's talent. She was a dab hand at Potions, Lily was! Here you are, then, here you are - one bottle of Felix Felicis, as promised, and use it well!\" Harry slipped the tiny bottle of golden liquid into his inner pocket, feeling an odd combination of delight at the furious looks on the Slytherins' faces and guilt at the disappointed expression on Hermione's. Ron looked simply dumbfounded. \"How did you do that?\" he whispered to Harry as they left the dungeon. \"Got lucky, I suppose,\" said Harry, because Malfoy was within earshot. Once they were securely ensconced at the Gryffindor table for dinner, however, he felt safe enough to tell them. Hermione's face became stonier with every word he uttered. \"I s'pose you think I cheated?\" he finished, aggravated by her expression. \"Well, it wasn't exactly your own work, was it?\" she said stiffly. \"He only followed different instructions to ours,\" said Ron, \"Could've been a catastrophe, couldn't it? But he took a risk and it paid off.\" He heaved a sigh. \"Slughorn could've handed me that book, but no, I get the one no one's ever written on. Puked on, by the look of page fifty-two, but-\" \"Hang on,\" said a voice close by Harry's left ear and he caught a sudden waft of that flowery smell he had picked up in Slughorn's dungeon. He looked around and saw that Ginny had joined them. \"Did I hear right? You've been taking orders from something someone wrote in a book, Harry?\" She looked alarmed and angry. Harry knew what was on her mind at once. \"It's nothing,\" he said reassuringly, lowering his voice. \"It's not like, you know, Riddle's diary. It's just an old textbook someone's scribbled on.\" \"But you're doing what it says?\" \"I just tried a few of the tips written in the margins, honestly, Ginny, there's nothing funny -\" \"Ginny's got a point,\" said Hermione, perking up at once. \"We ought to check that there's nothing odd about it. I mean, all these funny instructions, who knows?\" \"Hey!\" said Harry indignantly, as she pulled his copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bag and raised her wand. \"Specialis Revelio!\" she said, rapping it smartly on the front cover. Nothing whatsoever happened. The book simply lay there, looking old and dirty and dog-eared. \"Finished?\" said Harry irritably. \"Or d'you want to wait and see if it does a few backflips?\" \"It seems all right,\" said Hermione, still staring at the book suspiciously. \"I mean, it really does seem to be ... just a textbook.\" \"Good. Then I'll have it back,\" said Harry, snatching it off the table, but it slipped from his hand and landed open on the floor. Nobody else was looking. Harry bent low to retrieve the book, and as he did so, he saw something scribbled along the bottom of the back cover in the same small, cramped handwriting as the instructions that had won him his bottle of Felix Felicis, now safely hidden inside a pair of socks in his trunk upstairs. This book is the property of the Half Blood Prince. \n",

            " TWENTYSEVEN  PADFOOT RETURNS One of the best things about the aftermath of the second task was that everybody was very keen to hear details of what had happened down in the lake, which meant that Ron was getting to share Harry's limelight for once. Harry noticed that Ron's version of events changed subtly with every retelling. At first, he gave what seemed to be the truth; it tallied with Hermione's story, anyway  Dumbledore had put all the hostages into a bewitched sleep in Professor McGonagall's office, first assuring them that they would be quite safe, and would awake when they were back above the water. One week later, however, Ron was telling a thrilling tale of kidnap in which he struggled singlehandedly against fifty heavily armed merpeople who had to beat him into submission before tying him up. \"But I had my wand hidden up my sleeve,\" he assured Padma Patil, who seemed to be a lot keener on Ron now that he was getting so much attention and was making a point of talking to him every time they passed in the corridors. \"I could've taken those meridiots any time I wanted.\" \"What were you going to do, snore at them?\" said Hermione waspishly. People had been teasing her so much about being the thing that Viktor Krum would most miss that she was in a rather tetchy mood. Ron's ears went red, and thereafter, he reverted to the bewitched sleep version of events. As they entered March the weather became drier, but cruel winds skinned their hands and faces every time they went out onto the grounds. There were delays in the post because the owls kept being blown off course. The brown owl that Harry had sent to Sirius with the dates of the Hogsmeade weekend turned up at breakfast on Friday morning with half its feathers sticking up the wrong way; Harry had no sooner torn off Sirius's reply than it took flight, clearly afraid it was going to be sent outside again. Sirius's letter was almost as short as the previous one. Be at stile at end of road out of Hogsmeade (past Dervish and Banges) at two o'clock on Saturday afternoon. Bring as much food as you can. \"He hasn't come back to Hogsmeade?\" said Ron incredulously. \"It looks like it, doesn't it?\" said Hermione. \"I can't believe him,\" said Harry tensely, \"if he's caught. . .\" \"Made it so far, though, hasn't he?\" said Ron. \"And it's not like the place is swarming with dementors anymore.\" Harry folded up the letter, thinking. If he was honest with himself, he really wanted to see Sirius again. He therefore approached the final lesson of the afternoon  double Potions  feeling considerably more cheerful than he usually did when descending the steps to the dungeons. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were standing in a huddle outside the classroom door with Pansy Parkinson's gang of Slytherin girls. All of them were looking at something Harry couldn't see and sniggering heartily. Pansys puglike face peered excitedly around Goyle's broad back as Harry, Ron, and Hermione approached. \"There they are, there they are!\" she giggled, and the knot of Slytherins broke apart. Harry saw that Pansy had a magazine in her hands  Witch Weekly. The moving picture on the front showed a curlyhaired witch who was smiling toothily and pointing at a large sponge cake with her wand. \"You might find something to interest you in there, Granger!\" Pansy said loudly, and she threw the magazine at Hermione, who caught it, looking startled. At that moment, the dungeon door opened, and Snape beckoned them all inside. Hermione, Harry, and Ron headed for a table at the back of the dungeon as usual. Once Snape had turned his back on them to write up the ingredients of todays potion on the blackboard, Hermione hastily rifled through the magazine under the desk. At last, in the center pages, Hermione found what they were looking for. Harry and Ron leaned in closer. A color photograph of Harry headed a short piece entitled: Harry Potter's Secret Heartache A boy like no other, perhaps  yet a boy suffering all the usual pangs of adolescence, writes Rita Skeeter. Deprived of love since the tragic demise of his parents, fourteenyearold Harry Potter thought he had found solace in his steady girlfriend at Hogwarts, Muggleborn Hermione Granger. Little did he know that he would shortly be suffering yet another emotional blow in a life already littered with personal loss. Miss Granger, a plain but ambitious girl, seems to have a taste for famous wizards that Harry alone cannot satisfy. Since the arrival at Hogwarts of Viktor Krum, Bulgarian Seeker and hero of the last World Quidditch Cup, Miss Granger has been toying with both boys' affections. Krum, who is openly smitten with the devious Miss Granger, has already invited her to visit him in Bulgaria over the summer holidays, and insists that he has \"never felt this way about any other girl.\" However, it might not be Miss Granger's doubtful natural charms that have captured these unfortunate boys' interest. \"She's really ugly,\" says Pansy Parkinson, a pretty and vivacious fourthyear student, \"but she'd be well up to making a Love Potion, she's quite brainy. I think that's how she's doing it.\" Love Potions are, of course, banned at Hogwarts, and no doubt Albus Dumbledore will want to investigate these claims. In the meantime, Harry Potters wellwishers must hope that, next time, he bestows his heart on a worthier candidate. \"I told you!\" Ron hissed at Hermione as she stared down at the article. \"I told you not to annoy Rita Skeeter! She's made you out to be some sort of of scarlet woman!\" Hermione stopped looking astonished and snorted with laughter. \"Scarlet woman?\" she repeated, shaking with suppressed giggles as she looked around at Ron. \"It's what my mum calls them,\" Ron muttered, his ears going red. \"If that's the best Rita can do, she's losing her touch,\" said Hermione, still giggling, as she threw Witch Weekly onto the empty chair beside her. \"What a pile of old rubbish.\" She looked over at the Slytherins, who were all watching her and Harry closely across the room to see if they had been upset by the article. Hermione gave them a sarcastic smile and a wave, and she, Harry, and Ron started unpacking the ingredients they would need for their WitSharpening Potion. \"There's something funny, though,\" said Hermione ten minutes later, holding her pestle suspended over a bowl of scarab beetles. \"How could Rita Skeeter have known . . . ?\" \"Known what?\" said Ron quickly. \"You haven't been mixing up Love Potions, have you?\" \"Don't be stupid,\" Hermione snapped, starting to pound up her beetles again. \"No, it's just. . . how did she know Viktor asked me to visit him over the summer?\" Hermione blushed scarlet as she said this and determinedly avoided Ron's eyes. \"What?\" said Ron, dropping his pestle with a loud clunk. \"He asked me right after he'd pulled me out of the lake,\" Hermione muttered. \"After he'd got rid of his shark's head. Madam Pomfrey gave us both blankets and then he sort of pulled me away from the judges so they wouldn't hear, and he said, if I wasn't doing anything over the summer, would I like to \" \"And what did you say?\" said Ron, who had picked up his pestle and was grinding it on the desk, a good six inches from his bowl, because he was looking at Hermione. \"And he did say he'd never felt the same way about anyone else,\" Hermione went on, going so red now that Harry could almost feel the heat coming from her, \"but how could Rita Skeeter have heard him? She wasn't there ... or was she? Maybe she has got an Invisibility Cloak; maybe she sneaked onto the grounds to watch the second task. ...\" \"And what did you say?\" Ron repeated, pounding his pestle down so hard that it dented the desk. \"Well, I was too busy seeing whether you and Harry were okay to\" \"Fascinating though your social life undoubtedly is. Miss Granger,\" said an icy voice right behind them, and all three of them jumped, \"I must ask you not to discuss it in my class. Ten points from Gryffindor.\" Snape had glided over to their desk while they were talking. The whole class was now looking around at them; Malfoy took the opportunity to flash POTTER STINKS across the dungeon at Harry. \"Ah . . . reading magazines under the table as well?\" Snape added, snatching up the copy of Witch Weekly. \"A further ten points from Gryffindor ... oh but of course ...\" Snapes black eyes glittered as they fell on Rita Skeeter's article. \"Potter has to keep up with his press cuttings. . . .\" The dungeon rang with the Slytherins' laughter, and an unpleasant smile curled Snape's thin mouth. To Harry's fury, he began to read the article aloud. \"'Harry Potter's Secret Heartache. . . dear, dear. Potter, what's ailing you now? 'A boy like no other, perhaps. . .'“ Harry could feel his face burning. Snape was pausing at the end of every sentence to allow the Slytherins a hearty laugh. The article sounded ten times worse when read by Snape. Even Hermione was blushing scarlet now. \"'. . . Harry Potter's wellwishers must hope that, next time, he bestows his heart upon a worthier candidate.' How very touching,\" sneered Snape, rolling up the magazine to continued gales of laughter from the Slytherins. \"Well, I think I had better separate the three of you, so you can keep your minds on your potions rather than on your tangled love lives. Weasley, you stay here. Miss Granger, over there, beside Miss Parkinson. Potter  that table in front of my desk. Move. Now.\" Furious, Harry threw his ingredients and his bag into his cauldron and dragged it up to the front of the dungeon to the empty table. Snape followed, sat down at his desk and watched Harry unload his cauldron. Determined not to look at Snape, Harry resumed the mashing of his scarab beetles, imagining each one to have Snape's face. \"All this press attention seems to have inflated your already overlarge head. Potter,\" said Snape quietly, once the rest of the class had settled down again. Harry didn't answer. He knew Snape was trying to provoke him; he had done this before. No doubt he was hoping for an excuse to take a round fifty points from Gryffindor before the end of the class. \"You might be laboring under the delusion that the entire wizarding world is impressed with you,\" Snape went on, so quietly that no one else could hear him (Harry continued to pound his scarab beetles, even though he had already reduced them to a very fine powder), \"but I don't care how many times your picture appears in the papers. To me. Potter, you are nothing but a nasty little boy who considers rules to be beneath him.\" Harry tipped the powdered beetles into his cauldron and started cutting up his ginger roots. His hands were shaking slightly out of anger, but he kept his eyes down, as though he couldn't hear what Snape was saying to him. \"So I give you fair warning, Potter,\" Snape continued in a sorter and more dangerous voice, \"pintsized celebrity or not  if I catch you breaking into my office one more time \" \"I haven't been anywhere near your office!\" said Harry angrily, forgetting his feigned deafness. \"Don't lie to me,\" Snape hissed, his fathomless black eyes boring into Harrys. \"Boomslang skin. Gillyweed. Both come from my private stores, and I know who stole them.\" Harry stared back at Snape, determined not to blink or to look guilty. In truth, he hadn't stolen either of these things from Snape. Hermione had taken the boomslang skin back in their second year  they had needed it for the Polyjuice Potion  and while Snape had suspected Harry at the time, he had never been able to prove it. Dobby, of course, had stolen the gillyweed. \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" Harry lied coldly. \"You were out of bed on the night my office was broken into!\" Snape hissed. \"I know it. Potter! Now, MadEye Moody might have joined your fan club, but I will not tolerate your behavior! One more nighttime stroll into my office, Potter, and you will pay!\" \"Right,\" said Harry coolly, turning back to his ginger roots. \"I'll bear that in mind if I ever get the urge to go in there.\" Snape's eyes flashed. He plunged a hand into the inside of his black robes. For one wild moment. Harry thought Snape was about to pull out his wand and curse him  then he saw that Snape had drawn out a small crystal bottle of a completely clear potion. Harry stared at it. \"Do you know what this is. Potter?\" Snape said, his eyes glittering dangerously again. \"No,\" said Harry, with complete honesty this time. \"It is Veritaserum  a Truth Potion so powerful that three drops would have you spilling your innermost secrets for this entire class to hear,\" said Snape viciously. \"Now, the use of this potion is controlled by very strict Ministry guidelines. But unless you watch your step, you might just find that my hand slips\"  he shook the crystal bottle slightly  \"right over your evening pumpkin juice. And then. Potter . . . then we'll find out whether you've been in my office or not.\" Harry said nothing. He turned back to his ginger roots once more, picked up his knife, and started slicing them again. He didn't like the sound of that Truth Potion at all, nor would he put it past Snape to slip him some. He repressed a shudder at the thought of what might come spilling out of his mouth if Snape did it... quite apart from landing a whole lot of people in trouble  Hermione and Dobby for a start  there were all the other things he was concealing . . . like the fact that he was in contact with Sirius . . . and  his insides squirmed at the thought  how he felt about Cho. ... He tipped his ginger roots into the cauldron too, and wondered whether he ought to take a leaf out of Moody s book and start drinking only from a private hip flask. There was a knock on the dungeon door. \"Enter,\" said Snape in his usual voice. The class looked around as the door opened. Professor Karkaroff came in. Everyone watched him as he walked up toward Snape's desk. He was twisting his finger around his goatee and looking agitated. \"We need to talk,\" said Karkaroff abruptly when he had reached Snape. He seemed so determined that nobody should hear what he was saying that he was barely opening his lips; it was as though he were a rather poor ventriloquist. Harry kept his eyes on his ginger roots, listening hard. \"I'll talk to you after my lesson, Karkaroff,\" Snape muttered, but Karkaroff interrupted him. \"I want to talk now, while you can't slip off, Severus. You've been avoiding me.\" \"After the lesson,\" Snape snapped. Under the pretext of holding up a measuring cup to see if he'd poured out enough armadillo bile, Harry sneaked a sidelong glance at the pair of them. Karkaroff looked extremely worried, and Snape looked angry. Karkaroff hovered behind Snape's desk for the rest of the double period. He seemed intent on preventing Snape from slipping away at the end of class. Keen to hear what Karkaroff wanted to say, Harry deliberately knocked over his bottle of armadillo bile with two minutes to go to the bell, which gave him an excuse to duck down behind his cauldron and mop up while the rest of the class moved noisily toward the door. \"What's so urgent?\" he heard Snape hiss at Karkaroff. \"This,\" said Karkaroff, and Harry, peering around the edge of his cauldron, saw Karkaroff pull up the lefthand sleeve of his robe and show Snape something on his inner forearm. \"Well?\" said Karkaroff, still making every effort not to move his lips. \"Do you see? It's never been this clear, never since  \" \"Put it away!\" snarled Snape, his black eyes sweeping the classroom. \"But you must have noticed \" Karkaroff began in an agitated voice. \"We can talk later, Karkaroff!\" spat Snape. \"Potter! What are you doing?\" \"Clearing up my armadillo bile, Professor,\" said Harry innocently, straightening up and showing Snape the sodden rag he was holding. Karkaroff turned on his heel and strode out of the dungeon. He looked both worried and angry. Not wanting to remain alone with an exceptionally angry Snape, Harry threw his books and ingredients back into his bag and left at top speed to tell Ron and Hermione what he had just witnessed. They left the castle at noon the next day to find a weak silver sun shining down upon the grounds. The weather was milder than it had been all year, and by the time they arrived in Hogsmeade, all three of them had taken off their cloaks and thrown them over their shoulders. The food Sirius had told them to bring was in Harry's bag; they had sneaked a dozen chicken legs, a loaf of bread, and a flask of pumpkin juice from the lunch table. They went into Gladrags Wizardwear to buy a present for Dobby, where they had fun selecting the most lurid socks they could find, including a pair patterned with flashing gold and silver stars, and another that screamed loudly when they became too smelly. Then, at half past one, they made their way up the High Street, past Dervish and Banges, and out toward the edge of the village. Harry had never been in this direction before. The winding lane was leading them out into the wild countryside around Hogsmeade. The cottages were fewer here, and their gardens larger; they were walking toward the foot of the mountain in whose shadow Hogsmeade lay. Then they turned a corner and saw a stile at the end of the lane. Waiting for them, its front paws on the topmost bar, was a very large, shaggy black dog, which was carrying some newspapers in its mouth and looking very familiar. . . . \"Hello, Sirius,\" said Harry when they had reached him. The black dog sniffed Harry's bag eagerly, wagged its tail once, then turned and began to trot away from them across the scrubby patch of ground that rose to meet the rocky foot of the mountain. Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed over the stile and followed. Sirius led them to the very foot of the mountain, where the ground was covered with boulders and rocks. It was easy for him, with his four paws, but Harry, Ron, and Hermione were soon out of breath. They followed Sirius higher, up onto the mountain itself. For nearly half an hour they climbed a steep, winding, and stony path, following Sirius's wagging tail, sweating in the sun, the shoulder straps of Harry's bag cutting into his shoulders. Then, at last, Sirius slipped out of sight, and when they reached the place where he had vanished, they saw a narrow fissure in the rock. They squeezed into it and found themselves in a cool, dimly lit cave. Tethered at the end of it, one end of his rope around a large rock, was Buckbeak the hippogriff. Half gray horse, half giant eagle, Buckbeak's fierce orange eye flashed at the sight of them. All three of them bowed low to him, and after regarding them imperiously for a moment, Buckbeak bent his scaly front knees and allowed Hermione to rush forward and stroke his feathery neck. Harry, however, was looking at the black dog, which had just turned into his godfather. Sirius was wearing ragged gray robes; the same ones he had been wearing when he had left Azkaban. His black hair was longer than it had been when he had appeared in the fire, and it was untidy and matted once more. He looked very thin. \"Chicken!\" he said hoarsely after removing the old Daily Prophets from his mouth and throwing them down onto the cave floor. Harry pulled open his bag and handed over the bundle of chicken legs and bread. \"Thanks,\" said Sirius, opening it, grabbing a drumstick, sitting down on the cave floor, and tearing off a large chunk with his teeth. \"I've been living off rats mostly. Can't steal too much food from Hogsmeade; I'd draw attention to myself.\" He grinned up at Harry, but Harry returned the grin only reluctantly. \"What're you doing here, Sirius?\" he said. \"Fulfilling my duty as godfather,\" said Sirius, gnawing on the chicken bone in a very doglike way. \"Don't worry about it, I'm pretending to be a lovable stray.\" He was still grinning, but seeing the anxiety in Harrys face, said more seriously, \"I want to be on the spot. Your last letter . . . well, let's just say things are getting fishier. I've been stealing the paper every time someone throws one out, and by the looks of things, I'm not the only one who's getting worried.\" He nodded at the yellowing Daily Prophets on the cave floor, and Ron picked them up and unfolded them. Harry, however, continued to stare at Sirius. \"What if they catch you? What if you're seen?\" \"You three and Dumbledore are the only ones around here who know I'm an Animagus,\" said Sirius, shrugging, and continuing to devour the chicken leg. Ron nudged Harry and passed him the Daily Prophets. There were two: The first bore the headline Mystery Illness ofBartemius Crouch, the second, Ministry Witch Still MissingMinister of Magic Now Personally Involved. Harry scanned the story about Crouch. Phrases jumped out at him: hasn't been seen in public since November. . . house appears deserted. . . St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries decline comment. . . Ministry refuses to confirm rumors of critical illness. . . . \"They're making it sound like he's dying,\" said Harry slowly. \"But he can't be that ill if he managed to get up here. . . .\" \"My brothers Crouch's personal assistant,\" Ron informed Sirius. \"He says Crouch is suffering from overwork.\" \"Mind you, he did look ill, last time I saw him up close,\" said Harry slowly, still reading the story. \"The night my name came out of the goblet. ...\" \"Getting his comeuppance for sacking Winky, isn't he?\" said Hermione, an edge to her voice. She was stroking Buckbeak, who was crunching up Sirius's chicken bones. \"I bet he wishes he hadn't done it now  bet he feels the difference now she's not there to look after him.\" \"Hermione's obsessed with houseelfs,\" Ron muttered to Sirius, casting Hermione a dark look. Sirius, however, looked interested. \"Crouch sacked his houseelf?\" \"Yeah, at the Quidditch World Cup,\" said Harry, and he launched into the story of the Dark Mark's appearance, and Winky being found with Harrys wand clutched in her hand, and Mr. Crouch's fury. When Harry had finished, Sirius was on his feet again and had started pacing up and down the cave. \"Let me get this straight,\" he said after a while, brandishing a fresh chicken leg. \"You first saw the elfin the Top Box. She was saving Crouch a seat, right?\" \"Right,\" said Harry, Ron, and Hermione together. \"But Crouch didn't turn up for the match?\" \"No,\" said Harry. \"I think he said he'd been too busy.\" Sirius paced all around the cave in silence. Then he said, \"Harry, did you check your pockets for your wand after you'd left the Top Box?\" \"Erm . . .\" Harry thought hard. \"No,\" he said finally. \"I didn't need to use it before we got in the forest. And then I put my hand in my pocket, and all that was in there were my Omnioculars.\" He stared at Sirius. \"Are you saying whoever conjured the Mark stole my wand in the Top Box?\" \"It's possible,\" said Sirius. \"Winky didn't steal that wand!\" Hermione insisted. \"The elf wasn't the only one in that box,\" said Sirius, his brow furrowed as he continued to pace. \"Who else was sitting behind you?\" \"Loads of people,\" said Harry. \"Some Bulgarian ministers .. . Cornelius Fudge ... the Malfoys ...\" \"The Malfoys!\" said Ron suddenly, so loudly that his voice echoed all around the cave, and Buckbeak tossed his head nervously. \"I bet it was Lucius Malfoy!\" \"Anyone else?\" said Sirius. \"No one,\" said Harry. \"Yes, there was, there was Ludo Bagman,\" Hermione reminded him. \"Oh yeah . . .\" \"I don't know anything about Bagman except that he used to be Beater for the Wimbourne Wasps,\" said Sirius, still pacing. \"What's he like?\" \"He's okay,\" said Harry. \"He keeps offering to help me with the Triwizard Tournament.\" \"Does he, now?\" said Sirius, frowning more deeply. \"I wonder why he'd do that?\" \"Says he's taken a liking to me,\" said Harry. \"Hmm,\" said Sirius, looking thoughtful. \"We saw him in the forest just before the Dark Mark appeared,\" Hermione told Sirius. \"Remember?\" she said to Harry and Ron. \"Yeah, but he didn't stay in the forest, did he?\" said Ron. \"The moment we told him about the riot, he went off to the campsite.\" \"How d'you know?\" Hermione shot back. \"How d'you know where he Disapparated to?\" \"Come off it,\" said Ron incredulously. \"Are you saying you reckon Ludo Bagman conjured the Dark Mark?\" \"It's more likely he did it than Winky,\" said Hermione stubbornly. \"Told you,\" said Ron, looking meaningfully at Sirius, \"told you she's obsessed with house \" But Sirius held up a hand to silence Ron. \"When the Dark Mark had been conjured, and the elf had been discovered holding Harry's wand, what did Crouch do?\" \"Went to look in the bushes,\" said Harry, \"but there wasn't anyone else there.\" \"Of course,\" Sirius muttered, pacing up and down, \"of course, he'd want to pin it on anyone but his own elf... and then he sacked her?\" \"Yes,\" said Hermione in a heated voice, \"he sacked her, just because she hadn't stayed in her tent and let herself get trampled \" \"Hermione, will you give it a rest with the elf!\" said Ron. Sirius shook his head and said, \"She's got the measure of Crouch better than you have, Ron. If you want to know what a mans like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.\" He ran a hand over his unshaven face, evidently thinking hard. \"All these absences of Barty Crouch's ... he goes to the trouble of making sure his houseelf saves him a seat at the Quidditch World Cup, but doesn't bother to turn up and watch. He works very hard to reinstate the Triwizard Tournament, and then stops coming to that too. . . . It's not like Crouch. If he's ever taken a day off work because of illness before this, I'll eat Buckbeak.\" \"D'you know Crouch, then?\" said Harry. Sirius's face darkened. He suddenly looked as menacing as he had the night when Harry first met him, the night when Harry still believed Sirius to be a murderer. \"Oh I know Crouch all right,\" he said quietly. \"He was the one who gave the order for me to be sent to Azkaban  without a trial.\" \"What?\" said Ron and Hermione together. \"You're kidding!\" said Harry. \"No, I'm not,\" said Sirius, taking another great bite of chicken. \"Crouch used to be Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, didn't you know?\" Harry, Ron, and Hermione shook their heads. \"He was tipped for the next Minister of Magic,\" said Sirius. \"He's a great wizard, Barty Crouch, powerfully magical  and powerhungry. Oh never a Voldemort supporter,\" he said, reading the look on Harrys face. \"No, Barty Crouch was always very outspoken against the Dark Side. But then a lot of people who were against the Dark Side . . . well, you wouldn't understand . . . you're too young. ...\" \"That's what my dad said at the World Cup,\" said Ron, with a trace of irritation in his voice. \"Try us, why don't you?\" A grin flashed across Sirius's thin face. \"All right, I'll try you. . . .\" He walked once up the cave, back again, and then said, \"Imagine that Voldemort's powerful now. You don't know who his supporters are, you don't know who's working for him and who isn't; you know he can control people so that they do terrible things without being able to stop themselves. You're scared for yourself, and your family, and your friends. Every week, news comes of more deaths, more disappearances, more torturing . . . the Ministry of Magic's in disarray, they don't know what to do, they're trying to keep everything hidden from the Muggles, but meanwhile, Muggles are dying too. Terror everywhere . . . panic . . . confusion . . . that's how it used to be. \"Well, times like that bring out the best in some people and the worst in others. Crouch's principles might've been good in the beginning  I wouldn't know. He rose quickly through the Ministry, and he started ordering very harsh measures against Voldemorts supporters. The Aurors were given new powers  powers to kill rather than capture, for instance. And I wasn't the only one who was handed straight to the dementors without trial. Crouch fought violence with violence, and authorized the use of the Unforgivable Curses against suspects. I would say he became as ruthless and cruel as many on the Dark Side. He had his supporters, mind you  plenty of people thought he was going about things the right way, and there were a lot of witches and wizards clamoring for him to take over as Minister of Magic. When Voldemort disappeared, it looked like only a matter of time until Crouch got the top job. But then something rather unfortunate happened. ...\" Sirius smiled grimly. \"Crouch's own son was caught with a group of Death Eaters who'd managed to talk their way out of Azkaban. Apparently they were trying to find Voldemort and return him to power.\" \"Crouch's son was caught?\" gasped Hermione. \"Yep,\" said Sirius, throwing his chicken bone to Buckbeak, flinging himself back down on the ground beside the loaf of bread, and tearing it in half. \"Nasty little shock for old Barty, I'd imagine. Should have spent a bit more time at home with his family, shouldn't he? Ought to have left the office early once in a while . . . gotten to know his own son.\" He began to wolf down large pieces of bread. \"Was his son a Death Eater?\" said Harry. \"No idea,\" said Sirius, still stuffing down bread. \"I was in Azkaban myself when he was brought in. This is mostly stuff I've found out since I got out. The boy was definitely caught in the company of people I'd bet my life were Death Eaters  but he might have been in the wrong place at the wrong time, just like the houseelf.\" \"Did Crouch try and get his son off?\" Hermione whispered. Sirius let out a laugh that was much more like a bark. \"Crouch let his son off? I thought you had the measure of him, Hermione! Anything that threatened to tarnish his reputation had to go; he had dedicated his whole life to becoming Minister of Magic. You saw him dismiss a devoted house elf because she associated him with the Dark Mark again  doesn't that tell you what he's like? Crouch's fatherly affection stretched just far enough to give his son a trial, and by all accounts, it wasn't much more than an excuse for Crouch to show how much he hated the boy . . . then he sent him straight to Azkaban.\" \"He gave his own son to the dementors?\" asked Harry quietly. \"That's right,\" said Sirius, and he didn't look remotely amused now. \"I saw the dementors bringing him in, watched them through the bars in my cell door. He can't have been more than nineteen. They took him into a cell near mine. He was screaming for his mother by nightfall. He went quiet after a few days, though . . .they all went quiet in the end. . . except when they shrieked in their sleep. ...\" For a moment, the deadened look in Sirius's eyes became more pronounced than ever, as though shutters had closed behind them. \"So he's still in Azkaban?\" Harry said. \"No,\" said Sirius dully. \"No, he's not in there anymore. He died about a year after they brought him in.\" \"He died?\" \"He wasn't the only one,\" said Sirius bitterly. \"Most go mad in there, and plenty stop eating in the end. They lose the will to live. You could always tell when a death was coming, because the dementors could sense it, they got excited. That boy looked pretty sickly when he arrived. Crouch being an important Ministry member, he and his wife were allowed a deathbed visit. That was the last time I saw Barty Crouch, half carrying his wife past my cell. She died herself, apparently, shortly afterward. Grief. Wasted away just like the boy. Crouch never came for his sons body. The dementors buried him outside the fortress; I watched them do it.\" Sirius threw aside the bread he had just lifted to his mouth and instead picked up the flask of pumpkin juice and drained it. \"So old Crouch lost it all, just when he thought he had it made,\" he continued, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. \"One moment, a hero, poised to become Minister of Magic...next, his son dead, his wife dead, the family name dishonored, and, so I've heard since I escaped, a big drop in popularity. Once the boy had died, people started feeling a bit more sympathetic toward the son and started asking how a nice young lad from a good family had gone so badly astray. The conclusion was that his father never cared much for him. So Cornelius Fudge got the top job, and Crouch was shunted sideways into the Department of International Magical Cooperation.\" There was a long silence. Harry was thinking of the way Crouch's eyes had bulged as he'd looked down at his disobedient houseelf back in the wood at the Quidditch World Cup. This, then, must have been why Crouch had overreacted to Winky being found beneath the Dark Mark. It had brought back memories of his son, and the old scandal, and his fall from grace at the Ministry. \"Moody says Crouch is obsessed with catching Dark wizards,\" Harry told Sirius. \"Yeah, I've heard it's become a bit of a mania with him,\" said Sirius, nodding. \"If you ask me, he still thinks he can bring back the old popularity by catching one more Death Eater.\" \"And he sneaked up here to search Snape's office!\" s aid Ron triumphantly, looking at Hermione. \"Yes, and that doesn't make sense at all,\" said Sirius. \"Yeah, it does!\" said Ron excitedly, but Sirius shook his head. \"Listen, if Crouch wants to investigate Snape, why hasn't he been coming to judge the tournament? It would be an ideal excuse to make regular visits to Hogwarts and keep an eye on him.\" \"So you think Snape could be up to something, then?\" asked Harry, but Hermione broke in. \"Look, I don't care what you say, Dumbledore trusts Snape \" \"Oh give it a rest, Hermione,\" said Ron impatiently. \"I know Dumbledores brilliant and everything, but that doesn't mean a really clever Dark wizard couldn't fool him \" \"Why did Snape save Harry's life in the first year, then? Why didn't he just let him die?\" \"I dunno  maybe he thought Dumbledore would kick him out\" \"What d'you think, Sirius?\" Harry said loudly, and Ron and Hermione stopped bickering to listen. \"I think they've both got a point,\" said Sirius, looking thoughtfully at Ron and Hermione. \"Ever since I found out Snape was teaching here, I've wondered why Dumbledore hired him. Snape's always been fascinated by the Dark Arts, he was famous for it at school. Slimy, oily, greasyhaired kid, he was,\" Sirius added, and Harry and Ron grinned at each other. \"Snape knew more curses when he arrived at school than half the kids in seventh year, and he was part of a gang of Slytherins who nearly all turned out to be Death Eaters.\" Sirius held up his fingers and began ticking off names. \"Rosier and Wilkes  they were both killed by Aurors the year before Voldemort fell. The Lestranges  they're a married couple  they're in Azkaban. Avery  from what I've heard he wormed his way out of trouble by saying he'd been acting under the Imperius Curse  he's still at large. But as far as I know, Snape was never even accused of being a Death Eater  not that that means much. Plenty of them were never caught. And Snape s certainly clever and cunning enough to keep himself out of trouble.\" \"Snape knows Karkaroff pretty well, but he wants to keep that quiet,\" said Ron. \"Yeah, you should've seen Snape's face when Karkaroff turned up in Potions yesterday!\" said Harry quickly. \"Karkaroff wanted to talk to Snape, he says Snape's been avoiding him. Karkaroff looked really worried. He showed Snape something on his arm, but I couldn't see what it was.\" He showed Snape something on his arm?\" said Sirius, looking frankly bewildered. He ran his fingers distractedly through his filthy hair, then shrugged again. \"Well, I've no idea what that's about. . . but if Karkaroff s genuinely worried, and he's going to Snape for answers ...\" Sirius stared at the cave wall, then made a grimace of frustration. \"There's still the fact that Dumbledore trusts Snape, and I know Dumbledore trusts where a lot of other people wouldn't, but I just can't see him letting Snape teach at Hogwarts if he'd ever worked for Voldemort.\" \"Why are Moody and Crouch so keen to get into Snapes office then?\" said Ron stubbornly. \"Well,\" said Sirius slowly, \"I wouldn't put it past MadEye to have searched every single teacher's office when he got to Hogwarts. He takes his Defense Against the Dark Arts seriously, Moody. I'm not sure he trusts anyone at all, and after the things he's seen, it's not surprising. I'll say this for Moody, though, he never killed if he could help it. Always brought people in alive where possible. He was tough, but he never descended to the level of the Death Eaters. Crouch, though . . . he's a different matter ... is he really ill? If he is, why did he make the effort to drag himself up to Snape's office? And if he's not. . . what's he up to? What was he doing at the World Cup that was so important he didn't turn up in the Top Box! What's he been doing while he should have been judging the tournament?\" Sirius lapsed into silence, still staring at the cave wall. Buckbeak was ferreting around on the rocky floor, looking for bones he might have overlooked. Finally, Sirius looked up at Ron. \"You say your brother s Crouch's personal assistant? Any chance you could ask him if he's seen Crouch lately?\" \"I can try,\" said Ron doubtfully. \"Better not make it sound like I reckon Crouch is up to anything dodgy, though. Percy loves Crouch.\" \"And you might try and find out whether they've got any leads on Bertha Jorkins while you're at it,\" said Sirius, gesturing to the second copy of the Daily Prophet. \"Bagman told me they hadn't,\" said Harry. \"Yes, he's quoted in the article in there,\" said Sirius, nodding at the paper. \"Blustering on about how bad Bertha's memory is. Well, maybe she's changed since I knew her, but the Bertha I knew wasn't forgetful at all  quite the reverse. She was a bit dim, but she had an excellent memory for gossip. It used to get her into a lot of trouble; she never knew when to keep her mouth shut. I can see her being a bit of a liability at the Ministry of Magic . . . maybe that's why Bagman didn't bother to look for her for so long. ...\" Sirius heaved an enormous sigh and rubbed his shadowed eyes. \"What's the time?\" Harry checked his watch, then remembered it hadn't been working since it had spent over an hour in the lake. \"It's half past three,\" said Hermione. \"You'd better get back to school,\" Sirius said, getting to his feet. \"Now listen . . .\" He looked particularly hard at Harry. \"I don't want you lot sneaking out of school to see me, all right? Just send notes to me here. I still want to hear about anything odd. But you're not to go leaving Hogwarts without permission; it would be an ideal opportunity for someone to attack you.\" \"No one's tried to attack me so far, except a dragon and a couple of grindylows,\" Harry said, but Sirius scowled at him. \"I don't care . . . I'll breathe freely again when this tournament's over, and that's not until June. And don't forget, if you're talking about me among yourselves, call me Snuffles, okay?\" He handed Harry the empty napkin and flask and went to pat Buckbeak goodbye. \"I'll walk to the edge of the village with you,\" said Sirius, \"see if I can scrounge another paper.\" He transformed into the great black dog before they left the cave, and they walked back down the mountainside with him, across the boulderstrewn ground, and back to the stile. Here he allowed each of them to pat him on the head, before turning and setting off at a run around the outskirts of the village. Harry, Ron, and Hermione made their way back into Hogsmeade and up toward Hogwarts. \"Wonder if Percy knows all that stuff about Crouch?\" Ron said as they walked up the drive to the castle. \"But maybe he doesn't care . . . It'd probably just make him admire Crouch even more. Yeah, Percy loves rules. He'd just say Crouch was refusing to break them for his own son.\" \"Percy would never throw any of his family to the dementors,\" said Hermione severely. \"I don't know,\" said Ron. \"If he thought we were standing in the way of his career .. . Percy's really ambitious, you know. ...\" They walked up the stone steps into the entrance hall, where the delicious smells of dinner wafted toward them from the Great Hall. \"Poor old Snuffles,\" said Ron, breathing deeply. \"He must really like you. Harry. . . . Imagine having to live off rats.\" \n",

            "-Six The Flaw in the Plan He was flying facedown on the grond again. The smell of the forest filled his nostrils. He could feel the cold hard ground beneath his cheek, and the hinge of his glasses which have been knocked sideways by the fall cutting into his temple. Every inch of him ached, and the place where Killing Curse had hit him felt like the bruise of an iron-clad punch. He did not stir, but he remained exactly where he had fallen, with his left arm bent out at an akward angle and his mouth gaping. He had expected to hear cheer of triumph and jubilation at his death, but instead hurried footsteps, whispers, and solicitous murmurs filled the air. \"My Lord... my Lord...\" It was Bellatrix's voice, and she spoke as if to a lover. Harry did not dare open his eyes, but allowed his other senses to explore his predicament. He knew that his wand was still stowed beneath his robes because he could feel it pressed between his chest and the ground. A slight cushioning effect in the area of his stomach told him that the Invisibility Cloak was also there, stuffed out of sight. \"My Lord...\" \"That will do,\" said Voldemort's voice. More footsteps. Several people were backing away from the same spot. Desperate to see what was happening and why, Harry opened his eyes by a milimeter. Voldemort seemed to be getting to his feet. Various Death Eaters were hurrying away from him, returning to the crowd lining the clearing. Bellatrix alone remained behind, kneeling beside Voldemort. Harry closed his eyes again and considered what he had seen. The Death Eaters have been buddled around Voldemort, who seem to have fallen to the ground. Something had happened when he had hit Harry with the Killing Curse. Had Voldemort too collapsed? It seemed like it. And both of them had briefly fallen unconcious and both of them had now returned. . . \"My Lord, let me --\" \"I do not require assitance,\" said Voldemort coldly, and though he could not see it, Harry pictured Bellatrix withdrawing a helpful hand. \"The boy . . . Is he dead?\" There was a complete silence in the clearing. Nobody approached Harry, but he felt their concentraded gaze; it seemed to press him harder into the ground, and he was terrified a finger or an eyelid might twitch. \"You,\" said Voldemort, and there was a bang and a small shrick of pain. \"Examine him. Tell me whether he is dead.\" Harry did not know who had been sent to verify. He could only lie there, with his heart thumping traitorously, and wait to be examined, but at the same time nothing, small comfort through it was, that Voldemort was wary of approaching him, that Voldemort suspected that all had not gone to plan . . . . Hands, softer than he had been expecting, touched Harry's face, and felt his heart. He could hear the woman's fast breathing, her pounding of life against his ribs. \"Is Draco alive? Is he in the castle?\" The whisper was barely audible, her lips were an inch from his car, her head bent so low that her long hair shielded his face from the onlookers. \"Yes,\" he breathed back. He felt the hand on his chest contract: her nails pierced him. Then it was withdrawn. She had sat up. \"He is dead!\" Narcissa Malfoy called to the watchers. And now they shouted, now they yelled in triumph and stamped their feet, and through his eyelids, Harry saw bursts of red and silver light shoot into the air in celebration. Still feigning death on the ground, he understood. Narcissa knew that the only way she would be permitted to enter Hogwarts, and find her son, was as part of the conquering army. She no longer cared whether Voldemort won. \"You see?\" screeched Voldemort over the tumult. \"Harry Potter is dead by my hand, and no man alive can threaten me now! Watch! Crucio!\" Harry had been expecting it, knew his body would not be allowed to remain unsullied upon the forest floor; it must be subjected to humiliation to prove Voldemort's victory. He was lifted into the air, and it took all his determination to remain limp, yet the pain he expected did not come. He was thrown once, twice, three times into the air. His glasses flew off and he felt his wand slide a little beneath his robes, but he kept himself floppy and lifeless, and when he fell no ground for the last time, the clearing echoed with jeers and shrieks of laughter. \"Now,\" said Voldemort, \"we go to the castle, and show them what has become of their hero. Who shall drag the body? No - Wait - \" There was a fresh outbreak of laughter, and after a few moments Harry felt the ground trembling beneath him. \"You carry him,\" Voldemort said. \"He will be nice and visible in your arms, will he not? Pick up your little friend, Hagrid. And the glasses - put on the glasses - he must be recognizable - \" Someone slammed Harry's glasses back onto his face with deliberate force, but the enormous hands that lifted him into the air were exceedingly gentle. Harry could feel Hagrid's arms trembling with the force of his heaving sobs; great tears splashed down upon him as Hagrid cradled Harry in his arms, and Harry did not dare, by movement or word, to intimate to Hagrid that all was not, yet, lost. \"Move,\" said Voldemort, and Hagrid stumbled forward, forcing his way through the close-growing trees, back through the forest. Branches caught at Harry's hair and robes, but he lay quiescent, his mouth lolling open, his eyes shut, and in the darkness, while the Death Eaters croed all around them, and while Hagrid sobbed blindly, nobody looked to see whether a pulse beat in the exposed neck of Harry Potter. . . . The two giants crashed along behind the Death Eaters; Harry could hear trees creaking and falling as they passed; they made so much din that birds toes shrieking into the sky, and even the jeers of the Death Eaters were drowned. The victorious procession marched on toward the open ground, and after a while Harry could tell, by the lightening of the darkness through his closed eyelids, that the trees were beginning to thin. \"BANE!\" Hagrid's unexpected bellow nearly forced Harry's eyes open. \"Happy now, are yeh, that yeh didn't fight, yeh cowardly bunch o' nags? Are yeh happy Harry Potter's - d-dead . . . ?\" Hagrid could not continue, but broke down in fresh tears. Harry wondered how many centaurs were watching their procession pass; he dared not open his eyes to look. Some of the Death Eaters called insults at the centaurs as they left them behind. A little later, Harry sensed, by a freshening of the air, that they had reached the edge of the forest. \"Stop.\" Harry thought that Hagrid must have been forced to obey Voldemort's command, because he lurched a little. And now a chill settled over them where they sood, and Harry heard the rasping breath of the dementors that patrolled the other trees. They would not affect him now. The fact of his own survival burned inside him, a talisman against them, as though his father's stag kept guardian in his heart. Someone passed close by Harry, and he knew that it was Voldemort himself because he spoke a moment later, his voice magically magnified so that it swelled through the ground, crashing upon Harry's eardrums. \"Harry Potter is dead. He was killed as he ran away, trying to save himself while you lay down your lives for him. We bring you his body as proof that your hero is gone. \"The battle is won. You have lost half of your fighters. My Death Eaters outnumber you, and the Boy Who Lived is finished. There must be no more war. Anyone who continues to resist, man, woman or child, will be slaughtered, as will every member of their family. Come out of the castle now, kneel before me, and you shall be spared. Your parents and children, your brothers and sisters will live and be forgiven, and you will join me in the new world we shall build togheter.\" There was silence in the grounds and from the castle. Voldemort was so close to him that Harry did not dare open his eyes again. \"Come,\" said Voldemort, and Harry heard him move ahead, and Hagrid was forced to follow. Now Harry opened his eyes a fraction, and saw Voldemort striding in front them, wearing the great snake Nagini around his shoulders, now free of her enchanted cage. But Harry had no possibility of extracting the wand concealed under his robes without being noticed by the Death Eaters, who marched on the either side of them through the slowly lightening darkness . . . . \"Harry,\" sobbed Hagrid. \"Oh, Harry . . . Harry . . .\" Harry shut his eyes tight again. He knew that they were approaching the castle and strained his ears to distinguish, above the gleeful voices of the Death Eaters and their tramping footsteps, signs of life from those within. \"Stop.\" The Death Eaters camte to a halt; Harry heard them spreading out in a line facing the opne front doors of the school. He could see, even though his closed lids, the teddish glow that meant light streamed upon him from the entrance hall. He waited. Any moment, the people for whom he had tried to die would see him, lying apparently dead, in Hagrid's arms. \"NO!\" The scream was the more terrible because he had never expected or dreamed that Professor McGonagall could make such a sound. He heard another women laughing nearby, and knew that Bellatrix gloried in McGonagall's despair. He squinted again for a single second and saw the open doorway filling with people, as the survivors of the battle came out onto the front steps to face their vanquishers and see the truth of Harry's death for themselves. He saw Voldemort standing a little in front of him, stroking Nagini's head with a single white finger. He closed his eyes again. \"No!\" \"No!\" \"Harry! HARRY!\" Ron's, Hermione's, and Ginny's voices were worse than McGonagall's; Harry wanted nothing more than to call back, yet he made himself lie silent, and their cries acted like a trigger; the crowd of survivors took up the cause, screaming and yelling abuse at the Death Eathers, until - \"SILENCE!\" cried Voldemort, and there was a bang and a flash of bright light, and silence was forced upn them all. \"It is over! Set him down, Hagrid, at my feet, where he belongs!\" Harry felt himself lowered onto the grass. \"You see? said Voldemort, and Harry felt him striding backward and forward right beside the place where he lay. \"Harry Potter is dead! Do you understand now, deluded ones? He was nothing, ever, but a boy who relied on others to sacrifice themselves for him!\" \"He beat you!\" yelled Ron, and the charm broke, and the defenders of Hogwarts were shouting and screaming again until a second, more powerful bang extinguished their voices once more. \"He was killed while trying to sneak out of the castle grounds,\" said Voldemort, and there was a relish in his voice for the lie. \"killed while trying to save himself - \" But Voldemort broke off: Harry heard a scuffle and a shout, then another bang, a flash of light, and grunt of pain; he opened his eyes an infinitesimal amount. Someone had broken free of the crowd and charged at Voldemort: Harry saw the figure hit the ground. Disarmed, Voldemort throwing the challenger's wand aside and laughing. \"And who is this?\" he said in his soft snake's hiss. \"Who has volunteered to demonstrate what happens to those who continue to fight when the battle is lost?\" Bellatrix gave a delighted laugh. \"It is Neville Longbottom, my Lord! The boy who has been giving the Carrows so much trouble! The son of the Aurors, remember?\" \"Ah, yes, I remember,\" said Voldemort, looking down at Neville, who was struggling back to his feet, unarmed and unproctected, standing in the no-man's-land between the survivors and the Death Eaters. \"But you are a pureblood, aren't you, my brave boy? Voldemort asked Neville, who stood facing him, his empty hands curled in fists. \"So what if I am?\" said Neville loudly. \"You show spirit and bravery, and you come of noble stock. You will make a very valuable Death Eater. We need your kind, Neville Longbottom.\" \"I'll join you when hell freezes over,\" said Neville. \"Dumbledore's Army!\" he shouted, and there was an answering cheer from the crowd, whom Voldemort's Silencing Charms seemed unable to hold. \"Very well,\" said Voldemort, and Harry heard more danger in the silkiness of his voice than in the most powerful curse. \"If that is your choice, Longbottom, we revert to the original plan. On your head,\" he said quietly, \"be it.\" Still watching through his lashes, Harry saw Voldemort wave his wand. Seconds later, out of one of the castle's shattered windows, something that looked like a misshapen bird flew through the half light and landed in Voldemort's hand. He shook the mildewed object by its pointed end and it dangled, emtpy and ragged: the Sorting Hat. \"There will be no more Sorting at Hogwarts School,\" said Voldemort. \"There will be no more Houses. The emblem, sheild and colors of my noble ancestor, Salazar Slythering, will suffice everyone. Won't they, Neville Longbottom?\" He pointed his wand at Neville, who grew rigid and still, then forced the hat onto Neville's head, so thta it slipped down below his eyes. There were movements from the watching crowd in front of the castle, and as one, the Death Eaters raised their wands, holding the fighters of Hogwarts at bay. \"Neville here is now going to demonstrate what happens to anyone foolish enough to continue to oppose me,\" said Voldemort, and with a flick of his wand, he caused the Sorting Hat to burst into flames. Screams split the dawn, and Neville was a flame, rooted to the spot, unable to move, and Harry could not bear it: He must act - And then many things happened at the same moment. They heard uproar from the distant boundary of the school as what sounded like hundreds of people came swarming over the out-of-sight walls and pelted toward the castle, uttering lowd war cries. At the same time, Grawp came lumbering around the side of the castel and yelled, \"HAGGER!\" His cry was answered by roars from Voldemort's giants: They ran at Grawp like bull elephants making the earth quake. Then came hooves and the twangs of bows, and arrows were suddenly falling amongst the Death Eaters, who broke ranks, shouting their surprise. Harry pulled the Invisibilty Cloak from inside his robes, swunt it over himself, and sprang to his feet, as Neville moved too. In one swift, fluid motin, Neville broke free of the Body-Bind Curse upon him; the flaming har fell off him and he drew from its depths something silver, with a glittering, rubied handle - The slash of the silver blade could not be heard over the roar of the oncoming crowd or the sounds of the clashing giants or of te stampending centaurs, and yet, it seemd to draw every eye. With a single stroke Neville sliced off the great snake's head, which spun high into the air, gleaming in the light flooding from the entrance hall, and Voldemort's mouth was open in a scream of fury that nobody could hear, and the snake's body thudded to the ground at his feet- Hidden beneath the Invisibilty Cloak, Harry cast a Shield Charm between Neville and Voldemort before the latter could raise his stamps of the battling giants, Hagrid's yell came loudets of all. \"HARRY!\" Hagrid shouted. \"HARRY - WHERE'S HARRY?\" Chaos reigned. The charging centaurs were scattering the Death Eaters, everyone was feeling the giants' stamping feet, and nearer and nearar thundered the reinforcements that had come from who knew where; Harry saw great winget creatues soaring the heads of Voldemort's giants, thestrals and Buckbeak the hippogriff scratching at their eyes while Grawp punched and pummeled them and now the wizards, defenders of Hogwarts and Death Eaters alike were being forced back into the castle. Harry was shooting jinxes and curses at any Death Eater he could see, and they crumpled, not knowing what or who had hit them, and their bodies were trampled by the retreating crowd. Still hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, Harry was buffered into the entrance hall: He was searching for Voldemort and saw him across the room, firing spells from his wand as he backed into the Great Hall, still screaming instructions to his followers as he sent curses flying left and right; Harry cast more Shield Charms, and Voldemort's would-be victims. Seamus Finnigan and Hannah Abbott, datted past him into the Great Hall, where they joined the fight already flourishing inside it. And now there were more, even more people storming up the front steps, and Harry saw Charlie Weasly overtaking Horace Slughorn, who was still wearing his emeral pijamas. They seemed to have returned at the head of what looked like the families and friends of every Hogwarts student who had remained to fight along with the shopkeeps and homeowners of Hogsmeade. The centaurs Bane, Ronan and Magorian burst into the hall with a great clatter of hooves, as behind Harry the door that led to the kitchens was blasted off its hinges. The house-elves of Hogwarts swarmed intot he entrance hall, screaming and waving carving knives and cleaver, and at their head, the locker of Regulus Black bouncing on his chest, was Kreacher, his bullfrog's voice audible even above this din: \"Fight! Fight! Fight for my Master, defender of house-elves! Fight the Dark Lord, in the name of brave Regulus! Fight!\" They were hacking and stabbing at the ankles and shim of Death Eaters their tiny faces alive with malice, and everywhere Harry looked Death Eaters were folding under sheer weight of numbers, overcome by spells, dragging arrows from wounds, stabbed in the leg by elves, or else simply attempting to escape, but swallowed by the oncoming horde. But it was not over yet: Harry sped between duelers, past atruggling prosoners, and into he Great Hall. Voldemort was in the center of the battle, and he was striking and smiting al within reach. Harry could not get a clear shot, but fought his way nearer, still invisible, and the Great Hall became more and more crowded as everyone who could walk forced their way inside. Harry saw Yaxley slammed tot he floor by George and Lee Jordan, saw Dolohov fall with a scream at Flitwick's hands, saw Walden Macnair thrown across the room by Hagrid, hit the stone wall opposite, and slide unconscious to the ground. He saw Ron and Neville bringing down Fenrir Greyback. Aberforth Stunning Rookwood, Arthur and Percy flooting Thicknesse, and Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy running through the crowd, not even attempting to fight, screaming for their son. Voldemort was now dueling McGonagall, Slughorn, Kingsley all at once, and there was a cold hatred in his face as they wove and ducked around him, unable to finish him - Bellatrix was still fighing too, fifty yards away from Voldemort, and like her master she dueled three at once: Hermione, Ginny and Luna, all battling their hardest, but Bellatrix was equal to them, and Harry's attention was diverted as a Killing Curse shot so close to Ginny that she missed death by an inch - He changed course, running at Bellatrix rather than Voldemort, but before he had gone a few steps he was knocked sideways. \"NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!\" Mrs. Weasley threw off her cloak as she ran, freeing her arms, Bellatrix spun on the spot, roaring with laughter at the sight of the new challenger. \"OUT OF MY WAY!\" shouted Mrs. Weasley to the three girls, and with a simple swipe of her wand she began to duel. Harry watched with terror and elation as Molly Weasley's wand slashed and twisted, and Bellatrix Lestrange's smile faltered and became a snarl. Jets of light flew from both wands, the floor around the withces' feet became bot and cracked; both woman were fighting to kill. \"No!\" Mrs. Weasley cried as a few students ran forward, trying to come to her aid. \"Get back! Get back! She is mine!\" Hundreds of people now lined the walls, watching the two fights, Voldemort and his three opponents, Bellatrix and Molly, and Harry stood, invisible, torn between both, wanting to attack and yet to protect, unable to be sure that he would not hit the innocent. \"What will happen to your children when I've killed you?\" taunted Bellatrix, as mad as her master, capering as Molly's curses danced around her. \"When Mummy's gone the same way as Freddie?\" \"You - will - never - touch - our - children - again!\" screamed Mrs. Weasley. Bellatrix laughed the same exhilarated laugh her cousin Sirius had given as he toppled backward through the veil, and suddenly Harry knew what was going to happen before it did. Molly's curse soared beneath Bellatrix's constreched arm and hit her squarely in the chest, directly over her heart. Bellatrix's glounting smile froze, her eyes seemd to bulge: For the tiniest space of time she knew what had happened, and then she toppled, and the watching crowd roared, and Voldemord screamed. Harry felt as though he turned into slow motin: he saw McGonagall, Kingsley and Slughorn blasted backward, flailing and writhing through the air, as Voldemort's fury at the fall of his last, best leutenant exploded with the force of a bomb, Voldemort raised his wand and directed it at Molly Weasley. \"Protego!\" roared Harry, and the Shield Charm expanded in the middle of the Hall, and Voldemort stared around for the source as Harry pulled off the Invisibility Cloak at last. The yell of shock, the cheers, the screams on every side of :\"Harry!\" \"HE'S ALIVE!\" were stifled at once. The crowd was afraid, and silence fell abruptly and completely as Voldemort and Harry looked at each other, and began, at the same moment, to circle each other. \"I don't want anyone else to help,\" Harry said loudly, and in the total silence his voice carried like a trumpet call. \"It's got to be like this. It's got to be me.\" Voldemort hissed. \"Potter doesn't mean that,\" he said, his red eyes wide. \"This isn't how he works, is it? Who are you going to use as a shield today, Potter?\" \"Nobody,\" said Harry simply. \"There are no more Horcruxes. It's just you and me. Neither can live while the other survives, and one of us is about to leave for good. . . .\" \"One of us?\" jeered Voldemort, and his wholy body was taut and his red eyes stared, a snake that was about to strike. \"You think it will be you, do you, the boy who has survived by accident, and because Dumbledore was pulling the strings?\" \"Accident, was it, when my mother died to save me?\" asked Harry. They were still moving sideways, both of them, in that perfect circle, maintaining the same distance from each other, and for Harry no face existed but Voldemort's. \"Accident, when I decided to fight in that graveyard? Accident, that I didn't defend myself tonight, and still survived, and returned to fight again?\" \"Accidents!\" screamed Voldemort, but still he did not strike, and the watching crowd was frozen as if Petrified, and of the hundreds in the Hall, nobody seemed to breathe but they two. \"Accident and chance and the fact that you crouched and sniveled behind the skirts of greater men and women, and permitted me to kill them for you!\" \"You won't be killing anyone else tonight,\" said Harry as they circled, and stared into each other's eyes, green into red. \"You won't be able to kill any of them ever again. Don't you get it? I was ready to die to stop you from hurting these people - \" \"But you did not!\" \" - I meant to, and that's what did it. I've done what my mother did. They're protected from you. Haven't you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding? You can't torture them. You can't touch them. You don't learn from your mistakes, Riddle, do you?\" \"You dare -\" \"Yes, I dare,\" said Harry. \"I know things you don't know, Tom Riddle. I know lots of important things that you don't. Want to hear some, before you make another big mistake?\" Voldemort did not speak, but powled in a circle, and Harry knew that he kept him temporarily mesmerized at bay, held back by the faintest possibility that Harry might indeed know a final secret. . . . \"Is it love again?\" said Voldemort, his snake's face jeering. \"Dumbledore favorite solution, love, which he claimed conqered death, though love did not stop him falling from the tower and breaking like and old waxwork? Love, which did not prevent me stamping out your Modblood mother like a cockroack, Potter - and nobody seems to love you enough to run forward this time and take my curse. So what will stop you dying now when I strike?\" \"Just one thing,\" said Harry, and still they circled each other, wrapped in each other, held apart by nothing but the last secret. \"If it is not love that will save you this time,\" said Voldemort, \"you must believe that you have magic that i do not, or else a weapon more powerful than mine?\" \"I believe both,\" said Harry, and he saw shock flit across the snakelike face, though it was instantly dispelled; Voldemort began to laugh, and the sound was more frightening than his screams; humorles and insane, it echoed around the silent Hall. \"You think you know more magic than I do?\" he said. \"Than I, than Lord Voldemort, who has performed magic that Dumbledore himself never dreamed of?\" \"Oh he dreamed of it,\" said Harry, \"but he knew more than you, knew enough not to do what you've done.\" \"You mean he was weak!\" screamed Voldemort. \"Too weak to dare, too weak to take what might have been his, what will be mine!\" \"No, he was cleverer than you,\" said Harry, \"a better wizard, a better man.\" \"I brought about the death of Albus Dumbledore!\" \"You thought you did,\" said Harry, \"but you were wrong.\" For the frist time, the watching crowd stirred as the hundreds of people around the walls drew breath as one. \"Dumbledore is dead!\" Voldemort hurled the words at Harry as in the marble tomb in the grounds of this castle, I have seen it, Potter, and he will not return!\" \"Yes, Dumbledore is dead,\" said Harry calmly, \"but you didn't have him killed. He chose his own manner of dying, chose it months before he died, arranged the whole thing with the man you thought was your servant.\" \"What chldish dream is this?\" said Voldemort, but still he did not strike, and his red eyes did not waver from Harry's. \"Severus Snape wasn't yours,\" said Harry. \"Snape was Dumbledore's. Dumbledore's from the moment you starting hunting down my mother. And you never realized it, because of the thing you can't understand. You never saw Snape cast a Patronus, did you, Riddle?\" Voldemort did not answer. They continued to circle each other like wolves about to tear each other apart. \"Snape's Patronus was a doe,\" said Harry, \"the same as my mother's, because he loved her for nearly all of his life, from the time when they were children. You should have realized,\" he said as he saw Voldemort's nostrils flare, \"he asked you to spare her life, didn't he?\" \"He desired her, that was all,\" sneered Voldemort, \"but when she had gone, he agreed that there were other women, and of purer blood, worhier of him - \" \"Of course he told you that,\" said Harry, \"but he was Dumbledore's spy from the moment you threatened her, and he's been working against you ever since! Dumbledore was already dying when Snape finished him!\" \"It matters not!\" shrieked Voldemort, who had followed every word with rapt attention, but now let out a cackle of mad laughter. \"It matters not whether Snape was mine or Dumbledore's, or what petty obstacles they tried to put in my path! I crushed them as I crushed your mother, Snape's supposed great love! Oh, but it all makes sense, Potter, and in ways that you do not understand! \"Dumbledore was trying to keep the Elder Wand from me! He intended that Snape should be the true master of the wand! But I got there ahead of you, little boy - I reached the wand before you could get your hands on it, I understood the truth before you caught up. I killed Severus Snape three hours ago, and the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny is truly mine! Dumbledore's last plan went wrong, Harry Potter!\" \"Yeah, it did.\" said Harry. \"You're right. But before you try to kill me, I'd advise you think what you've done . . . . Think, and try for some remorse, Riddle. . . .\" \"What is this?\" Of all the things that Harry had said to him, beyond any revelation or taunt, nothing had socked Voldemort like this. Harry saw is pupils contract to thin slits, saw the skin around his eyes whiten. \"It's your one last chance,\" said Harry, \"it's all you've got left. . . . I've seen what you'll be otherwise. . . . Be a man. . . try. . . Try for some remorse. . . .\" \"You dare --- ?\" said Voldemort again. \"Yes, I dare,\" said Harry, \"because Dumbledore’s last plan hasn’t backfired on me at all. It’s backfired on you, Riddle.\" Voldemort’s hand was trembling on the Elder Wand, and Harry gripped Draco’s very tightly. The moment, he knew, was seconds away. \"That wand still isn’t working properly for you because you murdered the wrong person. Severus Snape was never the true master of the Elder Wand. He never defeated Dumbledore.\" \"He killed --- \" \"Aren’t you listening? Snape never beat Dumbledore! Dumbledore’s death was planned between them! Dumbledore instended to die, undefeated, the wand’s last true master! If all had gone as planned, the wand’s power would have died with him, because it had never been won from him!\" \"But then, Potter, Dumbledore as good as gave me the wand!\" Voldemort’s voice shook with malicious pleasure. \"I stole the wand from its last master’s tomb! I removed it against the last master’s wishes! Its power is mine!\" \"You still don’t get it, Riddle, do you? Possessing the wand isn’t enough! Holding it, using it, doesn’t make it really yours. Didn’t you listen to Ollivander? The wand chooses the wizard . . . The Elder Wand recognized a new master before Dumbledore died, someone who never even laid a hand on it. The new master removed the wand from Dumbledore against his will, never realizing exactly what he had done, or that the world’s most dangerous wand had given him its allegiance . . .\" Voldemort’s chest rose and fell rapidly, and Harry could feel the curse coming, feel it building inside the wand pointed at his face. \"The true master of the Elder Wand was Draco Malfoy.\" Blank shock showed in Voldemort’s face for a moment, but then it was gone. \"But what does it matter?\" he said softly. \"Even if you are right, Potter, it makes no difference to you and me. You no longer have the phoenix wand: We duel on skill alone . . . and after I have killed you, I can attend to Draco Malfoy . . .\" \"But you’re too late,\" said Harry. \"You’ve missed your chance. I got there first. I overpowered Draco weeks ago. I took his wand from him.\" Harry twitched the hawthorn wand, and he felt the eyes of everyone in the Hall upon it. \"So it all comes down to this, doesn’t it?\" whispered Harry. \"Does the wand in your hand know its last master was Disarmed? Because if it does . . . I am the true master of the Elder Wand.\" A red-glow burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above them as an edge of dazzling sun appeared over the sill of the nearest window. The light hit both of their faces at the same time, so that Voldemort’s was suddenly a flaming blur. Harry heard the high voice shriek as he too yelled his best hope to the heavens, pointing Draco’s wand: \"Avada Kedavra!\" \"Expelliarmus!\" The bang was like a cannon blast, and the golden flames that erupted between them, at the dead center of the circle they had been treading, marked the point where the spells collided. Harry saw Voldemort’s green jet meet his own spell, saw the Elder Wand fly high, dark against the sunrise, spinning across the enchanted ceiling like the head of Nagini, spinning through the air toward the master it would not kill, who had come to take full possession of it at last. And Harry, with the unerring skill of the Seeker, caught the wand in his free hand as Voldemort fell backward, arms splayed, the slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upward. Tom Riddle hit the floor with a mundane finality, his body feeble and shrunken, the white hands empty, the snakelike face vacant and unknowing. Voldemort was dead, killed by his own rebounding curse, and Harry stood with two wands in his hand, staring down at his enemy’s shell. One shivering second of silence, the shock of the moment suspended: and then the tumult broke around Harry as the screams and the cheers and the roars of the watchers rent the air. The fierce new sun dazzled the windows as they thundered toward him, and the first to reach him were Ron and Hermione, and it was their arms that were wrapped around him, their incomprehensible shouts that deafened him. The Ginny, Neville, and Luna were there, and then all the Weasleys and Hagrid, and Kingsley and McGonagall and Flitwick and Sprout, and Harry could not hear a word that anyone was shouting, not tell whose hands were seizing him, pulling him, trying to hug some part of him, hundreds of them pressing in, all of them determined to touch the Boy Who Lived, the reason it was over at last --- The sun rose steadily over Hogwarts, and the Great Hall blazed with life and light. Harry was an indispensible part of the mingled outpourings of jubilation and mourning, of grief and celebration. They wanted him there with them, their leader and symbol, their savior and their guide, and that he had not slept, that he craved the company of only a few of them, seemed to occur to no one. He must speak to the bereaved, clasp their hands, witness their tears, receive their thanks, hear the news now creeping in from every quarter as the morning drew on; that the Imperiused up and down the country had come back to themselves, that Death Eaters were fleeing or else being captured, that the innocent of Azkaban were being released at that very moment, and that Kingsley Shacklebolt had been named temporary Minister of Magic. They moved Voldemort’s body and laid it in a chamber off the Hall, away form the bodies of Fred, Tonks, Lupin, Colin Creevey, and fifty others who had died fighting him. McGonagall had replaced the House tables, not nobody was sitting according to House anymore: All were jumbled together, teachers and pupils, ghosts and parents, centaurs and house-elves, and Firenze lay recovering in the corner, and Grawp peered in through a smashed window, and people were throwing food into his laughing mouth. After a while, exhausted and drained, Harry found himself sitting on a bench beside Luna. \"I’d want some peace and quiet, if it were me,\" she said. \"I’d love some,\" he replied. \"I’ll distract them all,\" she said. \"Use your cloak.\" And before he could say a word, she had cried, \"Oooh, look, a Blibbering Humdinger!\" and pointed out the window. Everyone who heard looked around, and Harry slid the Cloak up over himself, and got to his feet. Now he could move through the Hall without interference. He spotted Ginny two tables away; she was sitting with her head on her mother’s shoulder: There would be time to talk later, hours and days and maybe years in which to talk. He saw Neville, the sword of Gryffindor lying beside his plate as he ate, surrounded by a knot of fervent admirers. Along the aisle between the tables he walked, and he spotted the three Malfoys, huddled together as though unsure whether or not they were supposed to be there, but nobody was paying them any attention. Everywhere he looked, he saw families reunited, and finally, he saw the two whose company he craved most. \"It’s me,\" he muttered, crouching down between them. \"Will you come with me?\" They stood up at once, and together he, Ron and Hermione left the Great Hall. Great chunks were missing from the marble staircase, part of the balustrade gone, and rubble and bloodstains occurred ever few steps as their climbed. Somewhere in the distance they could hear Peeves zooming through the corridors singing a victory song of his own composition: We did it, we bashed them, wee Potter’s the one, And Voldy’s gone moldy, so now let’s have fun! \"Really gives a feeling for the scope and tragedy of the thing, doesn’t it?\" said Ron, pushing open a door to let Harry and Hermione through. Happiness would come, Harry though, but at the moment it was muffled by exhaustion, and the pain of losing Fred and Lupin and Tonks pierced him like a physical wound every few steps. Most of all he felt the most stupendous relief, and a longing to sleep. But first he owed an explanation to Ron and Hermione, who had stuck with him for so long, and who deserved the truth. Painstakingly he recounted what he had seem in the Pensieve and what had happened in the forest, and they had not even begun to express all their shock and amazement, when at last they arrived at the place to which they had been walking, though none of them had mentioned their destination. Since he had last seen it, the gargoyle guarding the entrance to the headmaster’s study had been knocked aside; it stood lopsided, looking a little punch-drunk, and Harry wondered whether it would be able to distinguish passwords anymore. \"Can we go up?\" he asked the gargoyle. \"Feel free,\" groaned the statue. They clambered over him and onto the spiral stone staircase that moved slowly upward like an escalator. Harry pushed open the door at the top. He had one, brief glimpse of the stone Pensieve on the desk where he had left it, and then an earsplitting noise made him cry out, thinking of curses and returning Death Eaters and the rebirth of Voldemort --- But it was applause. All around the walls, the headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts were giving him a standing ovation; they waved their hats and in some cases their wigs, they reached through their frames to grip each other’s hands; they danced up and down on their chairs in which they have been painted: Dilys Derwent sobbed unashamedly; Dexter Fortescue was waving his ear-trumpet; and Phineas Niggelus called, in his high, reedy voice, \"And let it be noted that Slytherin House played its part! Let our contribution not be forgotten!\" But Harry had eyes only for the man who stood in the largest portrait directly behind the headmaster’s chair. Tears were sliding down from behind the half-moon spectacles into the long silver beard, and the pride and the gratitude emanating from him filled Harry wit h the same balm as phoenix song. At last, Harry held up his hands, and the portraits fell respectfully silent, beaming and mopping their eyes and waiting eagerly for him to speak. He directed his words at Dumbledore, however, and chose them with enormous care. Exhausted and bleary-eyed though he was, he must make one last effort, seeking one last piece of advice. \"The thing that was hidden in the Snitch,\" he began, \"I dropped it in the forest. I don’t exactly here, but I’m not going to go looking for it again. Do you agree?\" \"My dear boy, I do,\" said Dumbledore, while his fellow pictures looked confused and curious. \"A wise and courageous decision, but no less than I would have expected of you. Does anyone know else know where it fell?\" \"No one,\" said Harry, and Dumbledore nodded his satisfaction. \"I’m going to keep Ignotus’s present, though,\" said Harry, and Dumbledore beamed. \"But of course, Harry, it is yours forever, until you pass it on!\" \"And then there’s this.\" Harry held up the Elder Wand, and Ron and Hermione looked at it with a reverence that, even in his befuddled and sleep-deprived state, Harry did not like to see. \"I don’t want it.\" said Harry. \"What?\" said Ron loudly. \"Are you mental?\" \"I know it’s powerful,\" said Harry wearily. \"But I was happier with mine. So . . .\" He rummaged in the pouch hung around his neck, and pulled out the two halves of holly tstill just connected by the finest threat of phoenix feather. Hermione had said that they could not be repaired, that the damage was too severe. All he knew was that if this did not work, nothing would. He laid the broken wand upon the headmaster’s desk, touched it with the very tip of the Elder Wand, and said, \"Reparo.\" As his wand resealed, red sparks flew out of its end. Harry knew that he had succeeded. He picked up the holly and phoenix wand and felt a sudden warmth in his fingers, as though wand and hand were rejoicing at their reunion. \"I’m putting the Elder Wand,\" he told Dumbledore, who was watching him with enormous affection and admiration, \"back where it came from. It can stay there. If I die a natural death like Ignotus, its power will be broken, won’t it? The previous master will never have been defeated. That’ll be the end of it. Dumbledore nodded. They smiled at each other. \"Are you sure?\" said Ron. There was the faintest trace of longing in his voice as he looked at the Elder Wand. \"I think Harry’s right,\" said Hermione quietly. \"That wand’s more trouble than it’s worth.\" said Harry. \"And quite honestly,\" he turned away from the painted portraits, thinking now only of the four-poster bed lying waiting for him in Gryffindor Tower, and wondering whether Kreacher might bring him a sandwich there, \"I’ve had enough trouble for a lifetime.\" Epilogue Nineteen Years Later Autumn seemed to arrive suddenly that year. The morning of the first of September was crisp as an apple, and as the little family bobbed across the rumbling road toward the great sooty station, the fumes of car exhausts and the breath of pedestrians sparkled like cobwebs in the cold air. Two large cages tattled on top of the laden trolleys the parents were pushing; the owls inside them hooted indignantly, and the redheaded girl trailed fearfully behind here brothers, clutching her father's arm. \"It won't be long, and you'll be going too,\" Harry told her. \"Two years,\" sniffed Lily. \"I want to go now!\" The commuters stared curiously at the owls as the family wove its way toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten, Albus's voice drifted back to Harry over the surrounding clamor; his sons had resumed the argument they had started in the car. \"I won't! I won't be a Slytherin!\" \"James, give it a rest!\" said Ginny. \"I only said he might be,\" said James, grinning at his younger brother. \"There's nothing wrong with that. He might be in Slytherin\" But James caught his mother's eye and fell silent. The five Potters approached the barrier. With a slightly cocky look over his shoulder at his younger brother, James took the trolley from his mother and broke into a run. A moment later, he had vanished. \"You'll write to me, won't you?\" Albus asked his parents immediately, capitalizing on the momentary absence of his brother. \"Every day, of you want us to,\" said Ginny. \"Not every day,\" said Albus quickly, \"James says most people only get letters from home about once a month.\" \"We wrote to James three times a week last year,\" said Ginny. \"And you don't want to believe everything he tells you about Hogwarts,\" Harry put in. \"He likes a laugh, your brother.\" Side by side, they pushed the second trolley forward, gathering speed. As they reached the barrier, Albus winced, but no collision came. Instead, the family emerged onto platform nine and three-quarters, which was obscured by thick white steam that was pouring from the scarlet Hogwarts Express. Indistinct figures were swarming through the mist, into which James had already disappeared. \"Where are they?\" asked Albus anxiously, peering at the hazy forms they passed as they made their way down the platform. \"We'll find them,\" said Ginny reassuringly. But the vapor was dense, and it was difficult to make out anybody's faces. Detached from their owners, voices sounded unnaturally loud, Harry thought he head Percy discoursing loudly on broomstick regulations, and was quite glad of the excuse not to stop and say hello. . . . \"I think that's them, Al,\" said Ginny suddenly. A group of four people emerged from the mist, standing alongside the very last carriage. Their faces only came into focus when Harry, Ginny, Lily, and Albus had drawn right up to them. \"Hi,\" said Albus, sounding immensely relieved. Roses, who was already wearing her brand-new Hogwarts robes, beamed at him. \"Parked all right, then?\" Ron asked Harry. \"I did. Hermione didn't believe I could pass a Muggle driving test, did you? She thought I'd have to Confound the examiner.\" \"No, I didn't,\" said Hermione, \"I had complete faith in you.\" \"As a matter of fact, I did Confund him,\" Ron whispered to Harry, as together they lifted Albus's trunk and owl onto the train. \"I only forgot to look in the wing mirror, and let's face it, I can use a Supersensory Charm for that.\" Back on the platform, they found Lily and Hugo, Rose's younger brother, having an animated discussion about which House they would be sorted into when they finally went to Hogwarts. \"If you're not in Gryffindor, we'll disinherit you,\" said Ron, \"but no pressure.\" \"Ron!\" Lily and Hugo laughed, but Albus and Rose looked solemn. \"He doesn't mean it,\" said Hermione and Ginny, but Ron was no longer paying attention. Catching Harry's eye, he nodded covertly to a point some fifty yards away. The steam had thinned for a moment, and three people stood in sharp relief against the shifting mist. \"Look who it is.\" Draco Malfoy was standing there with his wife and son, a dark coat buttoned up to his throat. His hair was receding somewhat, which emphasized the pointed chin. The new boy resembled Draco as much as Albus resembled Harry. Draco caught sight of Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny staring at him, nodded curtly, and turned away again. \"So that's little Scorpius,\" said Ron under his breath. \"Make sure you beat him in every test, Rosie. Thank God you inherited your mother's brains.\" \"Ron, for heaven's sake,\" said Hermione, half stern, half amused. \"Don't try to turn them against each other before they've even started school!\" \"You're right, sorry,\" said Ron, but unable to help himself, he added, \"Don't get too friendly with him, though, Rosie. Granddad Weasley would never forgive you if you married a pureblood.\" \"Hey!\" James had reappeared; he had divested himself of his trunk, owl, and trolley, and was evidently bursting with news. \"Teddy's back there,\" he said breathlessly, pointing back over his shoulder into the billowing clouds of steam. \"Just seen him! And guess what he's doing? Snogging Victoire!\" He gazed up at the adults, evidently disappointed by the lack of reaction. \"Our Teddy! Teddy Lupin! Snogging our Victoire! Our cousin! And I asked teddy what he was doing --\" \"You interrupted them?\" said Ginny. \"You are so like Ron --\" \"-- and he said he'd come to see her off! And then he told me to go away. He's snogging her!\" James added as though worried he had not made himself clear. \"Oh, it would be lovely if they got married!\" whispered Lily ecstatically. \"Teddy would really be part of the family then!\" \"He already comes round for dinner about four times a week,\" said Harry \"Why don't we just invite him to live with is and have done with it?\" \"Yeah!\" said James enthusiastically. \"I don't mind sharing with Al--Teddy could have my room!\" \"No,\" said Harry firmly, \"you and Al will share a room only when I want the house demolished.\" He checked the battered old watch that had once been Fabian Prewett's. \"It's nearly eleven, you'd better get on board.\" \"Don't forget to give Neville our love!\" Ginny told James as she hugged him. \"Mum! I can't give a professor love!\" \"But you know Neville--\" James rolled his eyes. \"Outside, yeah, but at school he's Professor Longbottom, isn't he? I can't walk into Herbology and give him love. . . .\" Shaking his head at his mother's foolishness, he vented his feelings by aiming a kick at Albus. \"See you later, Al. Watch out for the thestrals.\" \"I thought they were invisible? You said they were invisible!\" but James merely laughed, permitted his mother to kiss him, gave his father a fleeting hug, then leapt onto the rapidly filling train. They saw him wave, then sprint away up the corridor to find his friends. \"Thestrals are nothing to worry about,\" Harry told Albus. \"They're gentle things, there's nothing scare about them. Anyway, you won't be going up to school in the carriages, you'll be going in the boats.\" Ginny kissed Albus good-bye. \"See you at Christmas.\" \"Bye, Al,\" said Harry as his son hugged him. \"Don't forget Hagrid's invited you to tea next Friday. Don't mess with Peeves. Don't duel anyone till you're learned how. And don't let James wind you up.\" \"What if I'm in Slytherin?\" The whisper was for his father alone, and Harry knew that only the moment of departure could have forced Albus to reveal how great and sincere that fear was. Harry crouched down so that Albus's face was slightly above his own. Alone of Harry's three children, Albus had inherited Lily's eyes. \"Ablus Severus,\" Harry said quietly, so that nobody but Ginny could hear, and she was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to rose, who was now on the train, \"you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.\" \"But just say--\" \"--then Slytherin House will have gained an excellent student, won't it? It doesn't matter to us, Al. But if it matter to you, you'll be able to choose Gryffindor over Slytherin. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.\" \"Really?\" \"It did for me,\" said Harry. He had never told any of his children that before, and he saw the wonder in Albus's face when he said it. But how the doorsr were slamming all along the scarlet train, and the blurred outlines of parents swarming forward for final kisses, last-minute reminders, Albus jumped into the carriage and ginny closed the door behind him. Students were hanging from the windows nearest them. A great number of faces, both on the train and off, seemed to be turned toward Harry. \"Why are they all staring?\" demanded Albus as he and rose craned around to look at the other students. \"Don't let it worry you,\" said Ron. \"It's me, I'm extremely famous.\" Albus, Rose, Hugo, and Lily laughed. The train began to more, and Harry walked alongside it, watching his son's thin face, already ablaze with excitement. Harry kept smiling and waving, even though it was like a little bereavement, watching his son glide away from him. . . . The last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn air. The train rounded a corner. Harry's hand was still raised in farewell. \"He'll be alright,\" murmured Ginny. As Harry looked dat her, he lowered his hand absentmindedly and touched the lightning scar on his forehead. \"I know he will.\" The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well.\n",

            ": Birthday Surprises The next day Harry confided in both Ron and Hermione the task that Dumbledore had set him, though separately, for Hermione still refused to remain in Ron's presence longer than it took to give him a contemptuous look. Ron thought that Harry was unlikely to have any trouble with Slughorn at all. 'He loves you,' he said over breakfast, waving an airy forkful of fried egg. 'Won't refuse you anything, will he? Not his little Potions Prince. Just hang back after class this afternoon and ask him.' Hermione, however, took a gloomier view. 'He must be determined to hide what really happened if Dumbledore couldn't get it out of him,' she said in a low voice, as they stood in the deserted, snowy courtyard at break. 'Horcruxes ... Horcruxes ... I've never even heard of them ...' 'You haven't?' Harry was disappointed; he had hoped that Hermione might have been able to give him a clue as to what Horcruxes were. 'They must be really advanced Dark magic, or why would Voldemort have wanted to know about them? I think it's going to be difficult to get the information, Harry, you'll have to be very careful about how you approach Slughorn, think out a strategy ...\" 'Ron reckons 1 should just hang back after Potions this afternoon ...' 'Oh, well, if Won-Won thinks that, you'd better do it,' she said, flaring up at once. 'After all, when has Won-Won's judgement ever been faulty?' 'Hermione, can't you --' 'No!' she said angrily, and stormed away, leaving Harry alone and ankle-deep in snow. Potions lessons were uncomfortable enough these days, seeing as Harry, Ron and Hermione had to share a desk. Today, Hermione moved her cauldron around the table so that she was close to Ernie, and ignored both Harry and Ron. 'What've you done?' Ron muttered to Harry, looking at Hermione's haughty profile. But before Harry could answer, Slughorn was calling for silence from the front of the room. 'Settle down, settle down, please! Quickly, now, lots of work to get through this afternoon! Golpalott's Third Law ... who can tell me -? But Miss Granger can, of course!' Hermione recited at top speed: 'Golpalott's-Third-Law- states-that-the-antidote-for-a-blended-poison-will-be-equal-to- more-than-the-sum-of-the-antidotes-for-each-of-the-separale- components.' 'Precisely!' beamed Slughorn. Ten points for Gryffindor! Now, if we accept Golpalott's Third Law as true ...\" Harry was going to have to take Slughorn's word for it that Golpalott's Third Law was true, because he had not under-stood any of it. Nobody apart from Hermione seemed to be following what Slughorn said next, either. '... which means, of course, that assuming we have achieved correct identification of the potion's ingredients by Scarpin's Revelaspell, our primary aim is not the relatively simple one of selecting antidotes to those ingredients in a of themselves, but to find that added component which will, by an almost alchemical process, transform these disparate elements -' Ron was sitting beside Harry with his mouth half-open, doodling absently on his new copy of Advanced Potion-Making. Ron kept forgetting that he could no longer rely on Hermione to help him out of trouble when he failed to grasp what was going on. '... and so,' finished Slughorn, 'I want each of you to come and take one of these phials from my desk. You are to create an antidote for the poison within it before the end of the lesson. Good luck, and don't forget your protective gloves!' Hermione had left her stool and was halfway towards Siughorn's desk before the rest of the class had realised it was time to move, and by the time Harry, Ron and Ernie returned to the table, she had already tipped the contents of her phial into her cauldron and was kindling a fire underneath it. 'it's a shame that the Prince won't be able to help you much with this, Harry,' she said brightly as she straightened up. 'You have to understand the principles involved this time. No short cuts or cheats!' Annoyed, Harry uncorked the poison he had taken from Siughorn's desk, which was a garish shade of pink, tipped it into his cauldron and lit a fire underneath it. He did not have the faintest idea what he was supposed to do next. He glanced at Ron, who was now standing there looking rather gormless, having copied everything Harry had done. 'You sure the Prince hasn't got any tips?' Ron muttered to Harry. Harry pulled out his trusty copy of Advanced Potion-Making and turned to the chapter on Antidotes. There was Golpalott's Third Law, stated word for word as Hermione had recited it, but not a single illuminating note in the Prince's hand to explain what it meant. Apparently the Prince, like Hermione, had had no difficulty understanding it. 'Nothing,' said Harry gloomily. Hermione was now waving her wand enthusiastically over her cauldron. Unfortunately, they could not copy the spell she was doing because she was now so good at non-verbal incan-tations that she did not need to say the words aloud. Ernie Macmillan, however, was muttering, 'Specialis revelio!' over his cauldron, which sounded impressive, so Harry and Ron hastened to imitate him. It took Harry only five minutes to realise that his reputa-tion as the best potion-maker in the class was crashing around his ears. Slughorn had peered hopefully into his cauldron on his first circuit of the dungeon, preparing to exclaim in delight as he usually did, and instead had with-drawn his head hastily, coughing, as the smell of bad eggs overwhelmed him. Hermione's expression could not have been any smugger; she had loathed being out-performed in every Potions class. She was now decanting the mysteriously separated ingredients of her poison into ten different crystal phials. More to avoid watching this irritating sight than any-thing else, Harry bent over the Half-Blood Prince's book and turned a few pages with unnecessary force. And there it was, scrawled right across a long list of antidotes. Just shove a bezoar down their throats. Harry stared at these words for a moment. Hadn't he once, long ago, heard of bezoars? Hadn't Snape mentioned them in their first ever Potions lesson? 'A stone taken from the stomach of a goat, which will protect from most poisons.' It was not an answer to the Golpalott problem, and had Snape still been their teacher, Harry would not have dared do it, but this was a moment for desperate measures. He hastened towards the store cupboard and rummaged within it, pushing aside unicorn horns and tangles of dried herbs until he found, at the very back, a small card box on which had been scribbled the word 'Bezoars'. He opened the box just as Slughorn called, Two minutes left, everyone!' Inside were half a dozen shrivelled brown objects, looking more like dried-up kidneys than real stones. Harry seized one, put the box back in the cupboard and hurried back to his cauldron. 'Time's ... UP!' called Slughorn genially. 'Well, let's see how you've done! Blaise ... what have you got for me?' Slowly, Slughorn moved around the room, examining the various antidotes. Nobody had finished the task, although Hermione was trying to cram a few more ingredients into her bottle before Slughorn reached her. Ron had given up com-pletely, and was merely trying to avoid breathing in the putrid fumes issuing from his cauldron. Harry stood there waiting, the bezoar clutched in a slightly sweaty hand. Slughorn reached their table last. He sniffed Ernie's potion and passed on to Ron's with a grimace. He did not linger over Ron's cauldron, but backed away swiftly, retching slightly. 'And you, Harry,' he said. 'What have you got to show me?' Harry held out his hand, the bezoar sitting on his palm. Slughorn looked down at it for a full ten seconds. Harry wondered, for a moment, whether he was going to shout at him. Then he threw back his head and roared with laughter. 'You've got a nerve, boy!' he boomed, taking the bezoar and holding it up so that the class could see it. 'Oh, you're like your mother ... well, 1 can't fault you ... a bezoar would certainly act as an antidote to all these potions!' Hermione, who was sweaty-faced and had soot on her nose, looked livid. Her half-finished antidote, comprising fifty-two ingredients including a chunk of her own hair, bubbled sluggishly behind Slughorn, who had eyes for nobody but Harry. 'And you thought of a bezoar all by yourself, did you, Harry?' she asked through gritted teeth. That's the individual spirit a real potion-maker needs!' said Slughorn happily, before Harry could reply. 'Just like his mother, she had the same intuitive grasp of potion-making, it's undoubtedly from Lily he gets it ... yes, Harry, yes, if you've got a bezoar to hand, of course that would do the trick ... although as they don't work on everything, and are pretty rare, it's still worth knowing how to mix antidotes ...' The only person in the room looking angrier than Hermione was Malfoy, who, Harry was pleased to see, had spilled some-thing that looked like cat sick over himself. Before either of them could express their fury that Harry had come top of the class by not doing any work, however, the bell rang. Time to pack up!' said Slughorn. 'And an extra ten points to Gryffindor for sheer cheek!' Still chuckling, he waddled back to his desk at the front of the dungeon. Harry dawdled behind, taking an inordinate amount of time to do up his bag. Neither Ron nor Hermione wished him luck as they left; both looked rather annoyed. At last Harry and Slughorn were the only two left in the room. 'Come on, now, Harry, you'll be late for your next lesson,' said Slughorn affably, snapping the gold clasps shut on his dragonskin briefcase. 'Sir,' said Harry, reminding himself irresistibly of Voldemort, '1 wanted to ask you something.' 'Ask away, then, my dear boy, ask away ...\" 'Sir, 1 wondered what you know about ... about Horcruxes?' Slughorn froze. His round face seemed to sink in upon itself. He licked his lips and said hoarsely, 'What did you say?' 'I asked whether you know anything about Horcruxes, sir. You see -' 'Dumbledore put you up to this,' whispered Slughorn. His voice had changed completely. It was not genial any more, but shocked, terrified. He fumbled in his breast pocket and pulled out a handkerchief, mopping his sweating brow. 'Dumbledore's shown you that - that memory,' said Slughorn. 'Well? Hasn't he?' 'Yes,' said Harry, deciding on the spot that it was best not to lie. 'Yes, of course,' said Slughorn quietly, still dabbing at his white face. 'Of course ... well, if you've seen that memory, Harry, you'll know that I don't know anything - anything -he repeated the word forcefully '- about Horcruxes.' He seized his dragonskin briefcase, stuffed his handkerchief back into his pocket and marched to the dungeon door. 'Sir,' said Harry desperately, 'I just thought there might be a bit more to the memory -' 'Did you?' said Slughorn. Then you were wrong, weren't you? WRONG!' He bellowed the last word and, before Harry could say another word, slammed the dungeon door behind him. Neither Ron nor Hermione was at all sympathetic when Harry told them of this disastrous interview Hermione was still seething at the way Harry had triumphed without doing the work properly. Ron was resentful that Harry hadn't slipped him a bezoar, too. 'It would've just looked stupid if we'd both done it!' said Harry irritably. 'Look, I had to try and soften him up so I could ask him about Voldemort, didn't I? Oh, will you gel a grip!' he added in exasperation, as Ron winced at the sound of the name. Infuriated by his failure and by Ron and Hermione's atti- tudes, Harry brooded for the next few days over what to do next about Slughorn. He decided that, for the time being, he would let Slughorn think that he had forgotten all about Horcruxes; it was surely best to lull him into a false sense of security before returning to the attack. When Harry did noi question Slughorn again, the Potions master reverted to his usual affectionate treatment of him, and appeared to have put the matter from his mind. Harry awaited an invitation to one of his little evening parties, determined to accept this time, even if he had to reschedule Quidditch prac- tice. Unfortunately, however, no such invitation arrived. Harry checked with Hermione and Ginny: neither of them had received an invitation and nor, as far as they knew, had anybody else. Harry could not help wondering whether this meant that Slughorn was not quite as forgetful as he appeared, simply determined to give Harry no additional opportunities to question him. Meanwhile, the Hogwarts library had failed Hermione for the first lime in living memory. She was so shocked, she even forgot that she was annoyed at Harry for his trick with the bezoar, 'I haven't found one single explanation of what Horcruxes do!\" she told him. 'Not a single one! I've been right through the restricted section and even in the most horrible books, where they tell you how to brew the most gruesome potions -nothing! All I could find was this, in the introduciion to Magick Mostc Evilc -- listen -- \"of the Horcrux, wickedest of magical inventions, we shall not speak nor give direction\" ... 1 mean, why mention it, then?' she said impatiently, slamming the old book shut; it let out a ghostly wail. 'Oh, shut up,' she snapped, stuffing it back into her bag. 'I asked whether you know anything about Horcruxes, sir. You see - 'Dumbledore put you up to this,' whispered Slughorn, His voice had changed completely. It was not genial any more, but shocked, terrified. He fumbled in his breast pocket and pulled out a handkerchief, mopping his sweating brow. 'Dumbledore's shown you that -- that memory,' said Slughorn. 'Well? Hasn't he?' 'Yes,' said Harry, deciding on the spot that it was best not to lie. 'Yes, of course,' said Slughorn quietly, still dabbing at his white face. 'Of course ... well, if you've seen that memory, Harry, you'll know that I don't know anything - anything -he repeated the word forcefully '- about Horcruxes.' He seized his dragonskin briefcase, stuffed his handkerchief back into his pocket and marched to the dungeon door. 'Sir,' said Harry desperately, '1 just thought there might be a 'Did you?' said Slughorn. Then you were wrong, weren't you? WRONG!' He bellowed the last word and, before Harry could say another word, slammed the dungeon door behind him. Neither Ron nor Hermione was at all sympathetic when Harry told them of this disastrous interview. Hermione was still seething at the way Harry had triumphed without doing the work properly. Ron was resentful that Harry hadn't slipped him a bezoar, too. 'It would've just looked stupid if we'd both done it!' said Harry irritably. 'Look, 1 had to try and soften him up so 1 could ask him about Voldemort, didn't I? Oh, will you get a grip!' he added in exasperation, as Ron winced at the sound of Infuriated by his failure and by Ron and Hermione's atti- tudes, Harry brooded for the next few days over what to do next about Slughorn. He decided that, for the time being, he would let Slughorn think that he had forgotten all about Horcruxes; it was surely best to lull him into a false sense of security before returning to the attack. When Harry did not question Slughorn again, the Potions master reverted to his usual affectionate treatment of him, and appeared to have put the matter from his mind. Harry awaited an invitation to one of his little evening parties, determined to accept this time, even if he had to reschedule Quidditch prac-tice. Unfortunately, however, no such invitation arrived. Harry checked with Hermione and Ginny: neither of them had received an invitation and nor, as far as they knew, had anybody else. Harry could not help wondering whether this meant that Slughorn was not quite as forgetful as he appeared, simply determined to give Harry no additional opportunities to question him. Meanwhile, the Hogwarts library had failed Hermione for the first time in living memory. She was so shocked, she even forgot that she was annoyed at Harry for his trick with the bezoar. 'I haven't found one single explanation of what Horcruxes do!' she told him. 'Not a single one! I've been right through the restricted section and even in the most horrible books, where they tell you how to brew the most gruesome potions -nothing! All I could find was this, in the introduction to Magick Moste Evile - listen - \"of the Horcrux, wickedest of magical inventions, we shall not speak nor give direction\" ... I mean, why mention it, then?' she said impatiently, slamming the old book shut; it let out a ghostly wail. 'Oh, shut up,' she snapped, stuffing it back into her bag. The snow melted around the school as February arrived, to be replaced by cold, dreary wetness. Purplish-grey clouds hung low over the castle and a constant fall of chilly rain made the lawns slippery and muddy. The upshot of this was that the sixth-years' first Apparition lesson, which was sched-uled for a Saturday morning so that no normal lessons would be missed, took place in the Great Hall instead of in the grounds. When Harry and Hermione arrived in the Hall (Ron had come down with Lavender) they found that the tables had disappeared. Rain lashed against the high windows and the enchanted ceiling swirled darkly above them as they assembled in front of Professors McGonagall, Snape, Flitwick and Sprout - the Heads of House - and a small wizard whom Harry took to be the Apparition Instructor from the Ministry. He was oddly colourless, with transparent eyelashes, wispy hair and an insubstantial air, as though a single gust of wind might blow him away. Harry wondered whether constant dis-appearances and reappearances had somehow diminished his substance, or whether this frail build was ideal for anyone wishing to vanish. 'Good morning,' said the Ministry wizard, when all the stu-dents had arrived and the Heads of House had called for quiet. 'My name is Wilkie Twycross and I shall be your Ministry-Apparition Instructor for the next twelve weeks. 1 hope to be able to prepare you for your Apparition test in this time -' 'Malfoy, be quiet and pay attention!' barked Professor McGonagall. Everybody looked round. Malfoy had flushed a dull pink; he looked furious as he stepped away from Crabbe, with whom he appeared to have been having a whispered argu-ment. Harry glanced quickly at Snape, who also looked annoyed, though Harry strongly suspected that this was less because of Malfoy's rudeness than the fact that McGonagall had reprimanded one of his house. '- by which time, many of you may be ready to take your test,' Twycross continued, as though there had been no interruption. 'As you may know, it is usually impossible to Apparate or Disapparate within Hogwarts. The Headmaster has lifted this enchantment, purely within the Great Hall, for one hour, so as to enable you to practise. May I emphasise that you will not be able to Apparate outside the walls of this Hall, and that you would be unwise to try. 'I would like each of you to place yourselves now so that you have a clear five feet of space in front of you.' There was a great scrambiing and jostling as people separ-ated, banged into each other, and ordered others out of their space. The Heads of House moved among the students, marshalling them into position and breaking up arguments. 'Harry, where are you going? 1 demanded Hermione. But Harry did not answer; he was moving quickly through the crowd, past the place where Professor Flitwick was making squeaky attempts to position a few Ravenclaws, all of whom wanted to be near the front, past Professor Sprout, who was chivvying the Hufflepuffs into line, until, by dodging around Ernie Macmillan, he managed to position himself right at the back of the crowd, directly behind Malfoy, who was taking advantage of the general upheaval to continue his argument with Crabbe, standing five feet away and looking mutinous. 'I don't know how much longer, all right?' Malfoy shot at him, oblivious to Harry standing right behind him. 'It's taking longer than I thought it would.' Crabbe opened his mouth, but Malfoy appeared to second-guess what he was going to say. 'Look, it's none of your business what I'm doing, Crabbe, you and Goyle just do as you're told and keep a lookout!' '! tell my friends what I'm up to, if I want them to keep a lookout for me,\" Harry said, just loud enough for Malfoy to hear him. Malfoy spun round on the spot, his hand flying to his wand, but at thai precise moment the four Heads of House shouted, 'Quiet!' and silence fell again. Malfoy turned slowly to face the front. Thank you,' said Twycross. :Now then ...' He waved his wand. Old-fashioned wooden hoops instantly appeared on the floor in from of every student. The important things to remember when Apparating are the three Ds!' said Twycross. 'Destination, Determination, Deliberation! 'Step one: fix your mind firmly upon the desired destin-ation,' said Twycross. 'In this case, the interior of your hoop. Kindly concentrate upon that destination now.' Everybody looked around furtively, to check that everyone else was staring into their hoop, then hastily did as they were told. Harry gazed at the circular patch of dusty floor enclosed by his hoop and tried hard to think of nothing else. This proved impossible, as he couldn't stop puzzling over what Malfoy was doing that needed lookouts. \"Step two,' said Twycross, 'focus your determination to occupy the visualised space! Let your yearning to enter it flood from your mind to every particle of your body!' Harry glanced around surreptitiously. A little way to his left, Ernie Macmillan was contemplating his hoop so hard that his face had turned pink; it looked as though he was straining to lay a Quaffle-sized egg. Harry bit back a laugh and hastily returned his gaze to his own hoop. 'Step three,' called Twycross, 'and only when 1 give the com-mand ... lum on the spot, feeiing your way into nothingness, moving with deliberation 1. On my command, now ... one- 1 Harry glanced around again; lots of people were looking positively alarmed at being asked to Apparate so quickly. Harry tried to fix his thoughts on his hoop again; he had already forgotten what the three Ds stood for. : - THREE!' Harry spun on the spot, lost his balance and nearly fell over. He was not the only one. The whole Hall was suddenly full of staggering people; Neville was flat on his back; Ernie Macmillan, on the other hand, had done a kind of pirouet-ting leap into his hoop and looked momentarily thrilled, until he caught sight of Dean Thomas roaring with laughter at him. 'Never mind, never mind,' said Twycross dryly, who did not seem to have expected anything better. 'Adjust your hoops, please, and back to your original positions ...' The second atlem.pt was no better than the first. The third was just as bad. Not until the fourth did anything exciting happen. There was a horrible screech of pain and everybody looked around, terrified, to see Susan Bones of Hufflepuff wobbling in her hoop with her left leg still standing five feet away where she had started. The Heads of House converged on her; there was a great bang and a puff of purple smoke, which cleared to reveal Susan sobbing, reunited with her leg but looking horrified. 'Sph'nching, or the separation of random body parts,' said Wilkie Twycross dispassionately, 'occurs when the mind is insufficiently determined. You must concentrate continually upon your destination, and move, without hasie, but with deliberation ... thus.' Twycross stepped forwards, turned gracefully on the spot with his arms outstretched and vanished in a swirl of robes, reappearing at the back of the Hall. 'Remember the three Ds,' he said, 'and try again ... one -two - three -' But an hour later, Susan's Splinching was still ihe most interesting thing that had happened. Twycross did not seem discouraged. Fastening his cloak at his neck, he merely said, 'Until next Saturday, everybody, and do not forget: Destin-ation. Determination. Deliberation.' With that, he waved his wand, Vanishing the hoops, and walked out of the Hall accompanied by Professor McGonagall. Talk broke out at once as people began moving towards the Entrance Hall. 'How did you do?' asked Ron, hurrying towards Harry. '1 think 1 felt something the last time I tried - a kind of tingling in my feet.' '1 expect your trainers are too small, Won-Won,' said a voice behind them, and Hermione stalked past, smirking. '1 didn't feel anything,' said Harry, ignoring this inter-ruption. \"But 1 don't care about that now-' 'What d'you mean, you don't care ... don't you want to leam to Apparate?' said Ron incredulously. 'I'm not fussed, really. I prefer flying,' said Harry, glancing over his shoulder to see where Malfoy was, and speeding up as they came into the Entrance Hall. 'Look, hurry up, will you, there's something I want to do ...' Perplexed, Ron followed Harry back to Gryffindor Tower at a run. They were temporarily detained by Peeves, who had jammed a door on the fourth floor shut and was refusing to let anyone pass until they set fire to their own pants, but Harry and Ron simply turned back and took one of their trusted short cuts. Within five minutes, they were climbing through the portrait hole. 'Are you going to tell me what we're doing, then?' asked Ron, panting slightly. 'Up here,' said Harry, and he crossed the common room and led the way through the door to the boys' staircase. Their dormitory was, as Ham' had hoped, empty. He flung open his trunk and began to rummage in it, while Ron watched impatiently. 'Harry ...' 'Malfoy's using Crabbe and Goyle as lookouts. He was argu-ing with Crabbe just now. 1 want to know ... aha.' He had found it, a folded square of apparently blank parchment, which he now smoothed out and tapped with [he tip of his wand. 'I solemn!)' swear that I am up to no good ... or Malfoy is, At once, the Marauder's Map appeared on the parchment's surface. Here was a detailed plan of every one of the castle's floors and, moving around it, the tiny, labelled black dots that signified each of the castle's occupants. 'Help me find Malfoy,' said Harry urgently. He laid the map upon his bed and he and Ron leaned over it, searching. 'There!' said Ron, after a minute or so. 'He's in the Slytherin common room, look ... with Parkinson and Zabini and Crabbe and Goyle ...\" Harry looked down at the map, disappointed, but rallied almost at once. 'Well, I'm keeping an eye on him from now on,' he said firmly. 'And the moment 1 see him lurking somewhere with Crabbe and Goyle keeping watch outside, it'll be on with the old Invisibility Cloak and off to find out what he's-' He broke off as Neville entered the dormitory, bringing with him a strong smell of singed material, and began rum-maging in his trunk for a fresh pair of pants. Despite his determination 10 catch Malfoy out, Harry had no luck at all over the next couple of weeks. Although he consulted the map as often as he could, sometimes making unnecessary visits to the bathroom between lessons to search it, he did not once see Malfoy anywhere suspicious. Admit-tedly, he spotted Crabbe and Goyle moving around the castle on their own more often than usual, sometimes remaining stationary in deserted corridors, but at these times Malfoy was not only nowhere near them, but impossible to locate on the map at all. This was most mysterious. Harry toyed with the possibility that Malfoy was actually leaving the school grounds, but could not see how he could be doing it, given the very high leve! of security now operating within the castle. He could only suppose ihat he was missing Malfoy amongst the hundreds of tiny black dots upon the map. As for the fact that Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle appeared to be going their dif-ferent ways when they were usually inseparable, these things happened as people got older - Ron and Hermione, Harry reflected sadly, were living proof. February moved towards March with no change in the weather except that it became windy as well as wet. To general indignation, a sign went up on all common-room noticeboards that the next trip into Hogsmeade had been cancelled. Ron was furious. 'It was on my birthday!' he said, 'i was looking forward to that!' 'Not a big surprise, though, is it?' said Harry. 'Not after what happened to Katie.' She had still not returned from Si Mungo's. What was more, further disappearances had been reported in the Daily Prophet, including several relatives of students at Hogwarts. 'But now all I've got to look forward to is stupid Appar-ition!' said Ron grumpily. 'Big birthday treat ...' Three lessons on, Apparition was proving as difficult as ever, though a few more people had managed to Splinch themselves. Frustration was running high and there was a certain amount of ill-feeling towards Wilkie Twycross and his three Ds, which had inspired a number of nicknames for him, the politest of which were Dog-breath and Dung-head. 'Happy birthday, Ron,' said Harry, when they were woken on the first of March by Seamus and Dean leaving noisily for breakfast. 'Have a present.' He threw the package across on to Ron's bed, where it joined a small pile of them that must, Harry assumed, have been delivered by house-elves in the night. 'Cheers,' said Ron drowsily, and as he ripped off the paper Harry got out of bed, opened his own crunk and began rum-maging in it for the Marauder's Map, which he hid after every use. He turfed out half the contents of his trunk before he found it hiding beneath the rolled-up socks in which he was still keeping his bottle of lucky potion, Felix Felicis. 'Right,' he murmured, taking it back to bed with him, tap-ping it quietly and murmuring, 'I solemnly swear that I am up to no good,' so that Neville, who was passing the foot of his bed at the time, would not hear. 'Nice one, Harry!' said Ron enthusiastically, waving the new pair of Quidditch Keeper's gloves Harry had given him. 'No problem,' said Harry absent-mindedly, as he searched the Slytherin dormitory closely for Malfoy. 'Hey ... I don't think he's in his bed ...' Ron did not answer; he was too busy unwrapping presents, every now and then letting out an exclamation of pleasure. 'Seriously good haul this year!' he announced, holding up a heavy gold watch with odd symbols around the edge and tiny moving stars instead of hands. 'See what Mum and Dad got me? Blimey, I think I'll come of age next year too ... 'Cool,' muttered Harry, sparing the watch a glance before peering more closely at the map. Where was Malfoy? He did not seem to be at the Slytherin table in the Great Hall, eating breakfast ... he was nowhere near Snape, who was sitting in his study ... he wasn't in any of the bathrooms or in the hospital wing ... 'Want one? 1 said Ron thickly, holding out a box of Chocolate Cauldrons. 'No thanks,' said Harry, looking up. 'Malfoy's gone again!' 'Can't have done,' said Ron, stuffing a second Cauldron into his mouth as he slid out of bed to get dressed. 'Come on. if you don't hurry up you'll have to Apparate on an empty-stomach ... might make it easier, 1 suppose ...\" Ron looked thoughtfully ai the box of Chocolate Cauldrons, then shrugged and helped himself to a third. Harry tapped the map with his wand, muttered, 'Mischief managed,' though it hadn't been, and got dressed, thinking hard. There had to be an explanation for Malfoy's periodic disappearances, but he simply could not think what it could be. The best way of finding out would be to tail him, bur even with the Invisibility Cloak this was an impractical idea; he had lessons, Quidditch practice, homework and Apparition; he could not follow Malfoy around school all day wilhout his absence being remarked upon, 'Ready?' he said to Ron. He was halfway to the dormitory door when he realised that Ron had not moved, but was leaning on his bedpost, staring out of the rain-washed window with a strangely un-focused look on his face. 'Ron? Breakfast.' 'I'm not hungry,' Harry stared ai him. 'I thought you just said -?' -Well, all right, I'll come down with you,' sighed Ron, 'but I don't want to eat.' Harry scrutinised him suspiciously. 'You've just eaten half a box of Chocolate Cauldrons, haven't you?' 'It's not that,' Ron sighed again. 'You ... you wouldn't understand.' 'Fair enough,' said Harry, albeit puzzled, as he turned to open the door. 'Harry!' said Ron suddenly. 'What?' 'Harry, I can't stand it!' 'You can't stand what?' asked Harry, now starling to feel definitely alarmed. Ron was rather pale and looked as though he was about to be sick. 'I can't stop thinking about her!' said Ron hoarsely. Harry gaped at him. He had not expected this and was not sure he wanted to hear it. Friends they might be, but if Ron started calling Lavender 'Lav-Lav', he would have to pui his foot down. 'Why does that stop you having breakfast?' Harry asked, trying to inject a note of common sense into the proceedings. 'I don't think she knows I exist,' said Ron with a desperate gesture. 'She definitely knows you exist,' said Harry, bewildered. 'She keeps snogging you, doesn't she?' Ron blinked. 'Who are you talking about?' Who are you talking about?' said Harry, with an increasing sense that all reason had dropped out of the conversation. 'Romilda Vane,' said Ron softly, and his whole face seemed to illuminate as he said it, as though hit by a ray of purest sunlight. They stared at each other for almost a whole minute, before Harry said, 'This is a joke, right? You're joking.' T think ... Harry, 1 ihink I love her,' said Ron in a strangled voice. 'OK,' said Harry, walking up to Ron 10 get a better look at the glazed eyes and the pallid complexion, 'OK ... say that again with a straight face.' 'I love her,' repeated Ron breathlessly. 'Have you seen her hair, it's all black and shiny and silky ... and her eyes? Her big dark eyes? And her -' 'This is really funny and everything,' said Harry impatiently, 'but joke's over, all right? Drop it.' He turned to leave; he had got two steps towards the door when a crashing blow hit him on the right ear. Staggering, he looked round. Ron's fist was drawn right back, his face was contorted with rage; he was about to strike again. Harry reacted instinctively; his wand was out of his pocket and the incantation sprang to mind without conscious thought: Le\\icorpus! Ron yelled as his heel was wrenched upwards once more; he dangled helplessly, upside-down, his robes hanging off him. 'What was that for?' Harry bellowed. 'You insulted her, Harry! You said it was a joke!' shouted Ron, who was slowly turning purple in the face as all the blood rushed to his head. 'This is insane!' said Harry. 'What's got into -?' And then he saw the box lying open on Ron's bed and the truth hit him with the force of a stampeding troll. 'Where did you get those Chocolate Cauldrons?' 'They were a birthday present!' shouted Ron, revolving slowly in midair as he struggled to get free. '1 offered you one, didn't 1?' 'You just picked them up off the floor, didn't you?' 'They'd fallen off my bed, all right? Let me go!' 'They didn't fall off your bed, you prat, don't you under-stand? They were mine, 1 chucked them out of my trunk when 1 was looking for the map. They're the Chocolate Cauldrons Romilda gave me before Christmas and they're all spiked with love potion!' But only one word of this seemed to have registered with Ron. 'Romilda?' he repeated. 'Did you say Romilda? Harry - do you know her? Can you introduce me?' Harry stared at the dangling Ron, whose face now looked tremendously hopeful, and fought a strong desire to laugh. A part of him - the part closest to his throbbing right ear - was quite keen on the idea of letting Ron down and watching him run amok until the effects of the potion wore off ... but on the other hand, they were supposed to be friends, Ron had not been himself when he had attacked, and Harry- thought that he would deserve another punching if he permitted Ron to declare undying love for Romilda Vane. 'Yeah, I'll introduce you,' said Harry, thinking fast. 'I'm going to let you down now, OK?' He sent Ron crashing back to the floor (his ear did hurt quite a lot), but Ron simply bounded to his feet again, grinning. 'She'll be in Slughorn's office, 1 said Harry confidently, leading the way to the door. 'Why will she be in there?' asked Ron anxiously, hurrying to keep up. 'Oh, she has extra Potions lessons with him,' said Harry, inventing wildly. 'Maybe 1 could ask if 1 can have them with her?' said Ron eagerly. 'Great idea,' said Harry. Lavender was waiting beside the portrait hole, a complication Harry had not foreseen. 'You're lace, Won-Won!' she pouted. 'I've got you a birth-day-' 'Leave me alone,' said Ron impatiently, 'Harry's going to introduce me to Romilda Vane.' And without another word to her, he pushed his way oui of the portrait hole. Harry tried to make an apologetic face to Lavender, but it might have turned out simply amused, because she looked more offended than ever as the Fat Lady swung shut behind them. Harry had been slightly worried that Slughorn might be at breakfast, but he answered his office door at the first knock, wearing a green velvet dressing-gown and matching nightcap and looking rather bleary-eyed. 'Harry,' he mumbled. 'This is very early for a call ... I generally sleep late on a Saturday ...\" 'Professor, I'm really sorry to disturb you,' said Harry as quietly as possible, while Ron stood on tiptoe, attempting to see past Slughorn into his room, 'but my friend Ron's swallowed a love potion by mistake. You couldn't make him an antidote, could you? I'd take him to Madam Pomfrey, but we're not supposed to have anything from Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes and, you know ... awkward questions ...' Td have thought you could have whipped him up a remedy, Harry, an expert potioneer like you?' asked Slughorn. 'Er,' said Harry, somewhat distracted by the fact that Ron was now elbowing him in the ribs in an attempt to force his way into the room, 'well, I've never mixed an antidote for a love potion, sir, and by the time I get it right Ron might've done something serious -' Helpfully, Ron chose this moment to moan, 'I can't see her. Harry - is he hiding her?' 'Was this potion within date?' asked Slughorn, now eyeing Ron with professional interest. 'They can strengthen, you know, the longer they're kept.' That would explain a lot,' panted Harry, now positively wrestling with Ron to keep him from knocking Slughorn over. 'It's his birthday, Professor,' he added imploringly. 'Oh, all right, come in, then, come in,' said Slughorn, relenting. 'I've got the necessary here in my bag, it's not a difficult antidote ...' Ron burst through the door into Slughorn's overheated, crowded study, tripped over a tasselled footstool, regained his balance by seizing Harry around the neck and muttered, 'She didn't see that, did she?' 'She's not here yet,' said Harry, watching Slughorn opening his potion kit and adding a few pinches of this and that to a small crystal bottle. That's good,' said Ron fervently. 'How do I look?' 'Very handsome,' said Slughorn smoothly, handing Ron a glass of clear liquid. 'Now drink that up, it's a tonic for the nerves, keep you calm when she arrives, you know,' 'Brilliant,' said Ron eagerly, and he gulped the antidote down noisily. Harry and Slughorn watched him. For a moment, Ron beamed at them. Then, very slowly, his grin sagged and van-ished, to be replaced by an expression of utmost horror. 'Back to normal, then?' said Harry, grinning. Slughorn chuckled. Thanks a lot, Professor.' 'Don't mention it, m'boy, don't mention it,' said Slughorn, as Ron collapsed into a nearby armchair, looking devastated. 'Pick-me-up, that's what he needs,' Slughorn continued, now-bustling over to a table loaded with drinks. 'I've got Butter-beer, I've got wine, I've got one last bottle of this oak-matured mead ... hmm ... meant to give that to Dumbledore for Christmas ... ah well ...' he shrugged '... he can't miss what he's never had! Why don't we open it now and celebrate Mr Weasley's birthday? Nothing like a fine spirit to chase away the pangs of disappointed love ...' He chortled again and Harry joined in. This was the firsi time he had found himself almost alone with Slughorn since his disastrous first attempt to extract the true memory from him. Perhaps, if he could just keep Slughorn in a good mood ... perhaps if they got through enough of the oak-matured mead ... There you are, then,' said Slughorn, handing Harry and Ron a glass of mead each, before raising his own. 'Well, a very happy birthday, Ralph -' '- Ron -' whispered Harry. But Ron, who did not appear to be listening to the toast, had already thrown the mead into his mouth and swallowed it. There was one second, hardly more than a heartbeat, in which Harry knew there was something terribly wrong and Slughorn, it seemed, did not. '- and may you have many more - 'Ron!' Ron had dropped his glass; he half-rose from his chair and then crumpled, his extremities jerking uncontrollably. Foam was dribbling from his mouth and his eyes were bulging from their sockets. 'Professor!' Harry bellowed. 'Do something]' But Slughorn seemed paralysed by shock. Ron twitched and choked: his skin was turning blue. 'What - but -' spluttered Slughorn. Harry leapt over a low table and sprinted towards Slughorn's open potion kit, pulling out jars and pouches, while the terrible sound of Ron's gargling breath filled the room. Then he found it - the shrivelled kidney-like stone Slughorn had taken from him in Potions. He hurtled back to Ron's side, wrenched open his jaw and thrust the bezoar into his mouth. Ron gave a great shudder, a rattling gasp and his body became limp and still. \n",

            " THIRTY-SIX The Only One He Ever Feared \"He hasn’t gone!\" Harry yelled. He did not believe it; he would not believe it; still he fought Lupin with every bit of strength he had. Lupin did not understand; people hid behind that curtain; Harry had heard them whispering the first time he had entered the room. Sirius was hiding, simply lurking out of sight. \"SIRIUS!\" he bellowed. \"SIRIUS!\" \"He can’t come back, Harry,\" said Lupin, his voice breaking as he struggled to contain Harry. \"He can’t come back, because he’s d-\" \"HE - IS - NOT - DEAD!\" roared Harry. \"SIRIUS!\" There was movement going on around them, pointless bustling, the flashes of more spells. To Harry it was meaningless noise, the deflected curses flying past them did not matter, nothing mattered except that Lupin should stop pretending that Sirius - who was standing feet from them behind that old curtain - was not going to emerge at any moment, shaking back his dark hair and eager to re-enter the battle. Lupin dragged Harry away from the dais. Harry, still staring at the archway, was angry at Sirius now for keeping him waiting But some part of him realized, even as he fought to break free from Lupin, that Sirius had never kept him waiting before... Sirius had risked everything, always, to see Harry, to help him... if Sirius was not reappearing out of that archway when Harry was yelling for him as though his life depended on it, the only possible explanation was that he could not come back... that he really was. Dumbledore had most of the remaining Death Eaters grouped in the middle of the room, seemingly immobilized by invisible ropes; Mad-Eye Moody had crawled across the room to where Tonks lay, and was attempting to revive her; behind the dais there were still hashes of light, grunts and cries - Kingsley had run forward to continue Sirius’s duel with Bellatrix. \"Harry?\" Neville had slid down the stone benches one by one to the place where Harry stood. Harry was no longer struggling against Lupin, who maintained a precautionary grip on his arm nevertheless. \"Harry... I’b really sorry...\" said Neville. His legs were still dancing uncontrollably. \"Was dad man - was Sirius Black a - a friend of yours?\" Harry nodded. \"Here,\" said Lupin quietly, and pointing his wand at Neville’s legs he said, \"Finite.\" The spell was lifted: Neville’s legs fell back to the floor and remained still. Lupin’s face was pale. \"Let’s - let’s find the others. Where are they all, Neville?\" Lupin turned away from the archway as he spoke. It sounded as though every word was causing him pain. \"Dey’re all back dere,\" said Neville. \"A brain addacked Ron bud I dink he’s all righd - and Herbione’s unconscious, bud we could feel a bulse\" There was a loud bang and a yell from behind the dais. Harry saw Kingsley hit the ground yelling in pain: Bellatrix Lestrange turned tail and ran as Dumbledore whipped around. He aimed a spell at her but she deflected it; she was halfway up the steps now \"Harry - no!\" cried Lupin, but Harry had already ripped his arm from Lupin’s slackened grip. \"SHE KILLED SIRIUS!\" bellowed Harry. \"SHE KILLED HIM I’LL KILL HER!\" And he was off, scrambling up the stone benches; people were shouting behind him but he did not care. The hem of Bellatrix’s robes whipped out of sight ahead and they were back in the room where the brains were swimming... She aimed a curse over her shoulder. The tank rose into the air and tipped. Harry was deluged in the foul-smelling potion within: the brains slipped and slid over him and began spinning their long colored tentacles, but he shouted, \"Wingardium Leviosa!\" and they flew off him up into the air. Slipping and sliding, he ran on towards the door; he leapt over Luna, who was groaning on the floor, past Ginny, who said, \"Harry - what -?\", past Ron, who giggled feebly, and Hermione, who was still unconscious. He wrenched open the door into the circular black hall and saw Bellatrix disappearing through a door on the other side of the room; beyond her was the corridor leading back to the lifts. He ran, but she had slammed the door behind her and the walls were already rotating. Once more, he was surrounded by streaks of blue light from the whirling candelabra. \"Where’s the exit?\" he shouted desperately, as the wall rumbled to a halt again. \"Where’s the way out?\" The room seemed to have been waiting for him to ask. The door right behind him flew open and the corridor towards the lifts stretched ahead of him, torch-lit and empty. He ran... He could hear a lift clattering ahead; he sprinted up the passageway, swung around the corner and slammed his fist on to the button to call a second lift. It jangled and banged lower and lower; the grilles slid open and Harry dashed inside, now hammering the button marked ‘Atrium’. The doors slid shut and he was rising... He forced his way out of the lift before the grilles were fully open and looked around. Bellatrix was almost at the telephone lift at the other end of the hall, but she looked back as he sprinted towards her and aimed another spell at him. He dodged behind the Fountain of Magical Brethren: the spell zoomed past him and hit the wrought gold gates at the other end of the Atrium so that they rang like bells. There were no more footsteps. She had stopped running. He crouched behind the statues, listening. \"Come out, come out, little Harry!\" she called in her mock baby voice, which echoed off the polished wooden floors. \"What did you come after me for, then? I thought you were here to avenge my dear cousin!\" \"I am!\" shouted Harry, and a score of ghostly Harrys seemed to chorus I am! I am! I am! all around the room \"Aaaaaah... did you love him, little baby Potter?\" Hatred rose in Harry such as he had never known before; he flung himself out from behind the fountain and bellowed, \"Crucio!\" Bellatrix screamed: the spell had knocked her off her feet, but she did not writhe and shriek with pain as Neville had - she was already back on her feet, breathless, no longer laughing. Harry dodged behind the golden fountain again. Her counter-spell hit the head of the handsome wizard, which was blown off and landed twenty feet away, gouging long scratches into the wooden floor. \"Never used an Unforgivable Curse before, have you, boy?\" she yelled. She had abandoned her baby voice now. \"You need to mean them, Potter! You need to really want to cause pain - to enjoy it - righteous anger won’t hurt me for long - I’ll show you how it is done, shall I? I’ll give you a lesson -\" Harry was edging around the fountain on the other side when she screamed, \"Crucio!\" and he was forced to duck down again as the centaur’s arm, holding its bow, span off and landed with a crash on the floor a short distance from the golden wizard’s head. \"Potter, you cannot win against me!\" she cried. He could hear her moving to the right, trying to get a clear shot of him. He backed around the statue away from her, crouching behind the centaur’s legs, his head level with the house-elf’s. \"I was and am the Dark Lord’s most loyal servant. I learned the Dark Arts from him, and I know spells of such power that you, pathetic little boy, can never hope to compete\" \"Stupefy!\" yelled Harry. He had edged right around to where the goblin stood beaming up at the now headless wizard and taken aim at her back as she peered around the fountain. She reacted so fast he barely had time to duck. \"Protego!\" The jet of red light, his own Stunning Spell, bounced back at him. Harry scrambled back behind the fountain and one of the goblin’s ears went flying across the room. \"Potter, I’m going to give you one chance!\" shouted Bellatrix. \"Give me the prophecy - roll it out towards me now - and I may spare your life!\" \"Well, you’re going to have to kill me, because it’s gone!\" Harry roared and, as he shouted it, pain seared across his forehead; his scar was on fire again, and he felt a surge of fury that was quite unconnected with his own rage. \"And he knows!’\" said Harry, with a mad laugh to match Bellatrix’s own. \"Your dear old mate Voldemort knows it’s gone! He’s not going to be happy with you, is he?\" \"What? What do you mean?\" she cried, and for the first time there was fear in her voice. \"The prophecy smashed when I was trying to get Neville up the steps! What do you think Voldemort’ll say about that, then?\" His scar seared and burned... the pain of it was making his eyes stream... \"LIAR!\" she shrieked, but he could hear the terror behind the anger now. \"YOU’VE GOT IT, POTTER, AND YOU WILL GIVE IT TO ME! Accio prophecy! ACCIO PROPHECY!\" Harry laughed again because he knew it would incense her, the pain building in his head so badly he thought his skull might burst. He waved his empty hand from behind the one-eared goblin and withdrew it quickly as she sent another jet of green light flying at him. \"Nothing there!\" he shouted. \"Nothing to summon! It smashed and nobody heard what it said, tell your boss that!\" \"No!\" she screamed. \"It isn’t true, you’re lying! MASTER, I TRIED, I TRIED - DO NOT PUNISH ME\" \"Don’t waste your breath!\" yelled Harry, his eyes screwed up against the pain in his scar, now more terrible than ever. \"He can’t hear you from here!\" \"Can’t I, Potter?\" said a high, cold voice. Harry opened his eyes. Tall, thin and black-hooded, his terrible snakelike face white and gaunt, his scarlet, slit-pupilled eyes staring... Lord Voldemort had appeared in the middle of the hall, his wand pointing at Harry who stood frozen, quite unable to move. \"So, you smashed my prophecy?\" said Voldemort softly, staring at Harry with those pitiless red eyes. \"No, Bella, he is not lying... I see the truth looking at me from within his worthless mind... months of preparation, months of effort... and my Death Eaters have let Harry Potter thwart me again\" \"Master, I am sorry I knew not, I was fighting the Animagus Black!\" sobbed Bellatrix, flinging herself down at Voldemort’s feet as he paced slowly nearer. \"Master, you should know\" \"Be quiet, Bella,\" said Voldemort dangerously. \"I shall deal with you in a moment. Do you think I have entered the Ministry of Magic to hear your sniveling apologies?\" \"But Master - he is here - he is below\" Voldemort paid no attention. \"I have nothing more to say to you, Potter,\" he said quietly. \"You have irked me too often, for too long. AVADA KEDAVRA!\" Harry had not even opened his mouth to resist; his mind was blank, his wand pointing uselessly at the floor. But the headless golden statue of the wizard in the fountain had sprung alive, leaping from its plinth to land with a crash on the floor between Harry and Voldemort. The spell merely glanced off its chest as the statue flung out its arms to protect Harry. \"What -?\" cried Voldemort, staring around. And then he breathed, \"Dumbledore!\" Harry looked behind him, his heart pounding. Dumbledore was standing in front of the golden gates. Voldemort raised his wand and another jet of green light streaked at Dumbledore, who turned and was gone in a whirling of his cloak. Next second, he had reappeared behind Voldemort and waved his wand towards the remnants of the fountain. The other statues sprang to life. The statue of the witch ran at Bellatrix, who screamed and sent spells streaming uselessly off its chest, before it dived at her, pinning her to the floor. Meanwhile, the goblin and the house-elf scuttled towards the fireplaces set along the wall and the one-armed centaur galloped at Voldemort, who vanished and reappeared beside the pool. The headless statue thrust Harry backwards, away from the fight, as Dumbledore advanced on Voldemort and the golden centaur cantered around them both. \"It was foolish to come here tonight, Tom,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"The Aurors are on their way\" \"By which time I shall be gone, and you will be dead!\" spat Voldemort. He sent another killing curse at Dumbledore but missed, instead hitting the security guard’s desk, which burst into flame. Dumbledore flicked his own wand: the force of the spell that emanated from it was such that Harry, though shielded by his golden guard, felt his hair stand on end as it passed and this time Voldemort was forced to conjure a shining silver shield out of thin air to deflect it. The spell, whatever it was, caused no visible damage to the shield, though a deep, gong-like note reverberated from it - an oddly chilling sound. \"You do not seek to kill me, Dumbledore?\" called Voldemort, his scarlet eyes narrowed over the top of the shield. \"Above such brutality, are you?\" \"We both know that there are other ways of destroying a man, Tom,\" Dumbledore said calmly, continuing to walk towards Voldemort as though he had not a fear in the world, as though nothing had happened to interrupt his stroll up the hall. \"Merely taking your life would not satisfy me, I admit\" \"There is nothing worse than death, Dumbledore!\" snarled Voldemort. \"You are quite wrong,\" said Dumbledore, still closing in upon Voldemort and speaking as lightly as though they were discussing the matter over drinks. Harry felt scared to see him walking along, undefended, shieldless; he wanted to cry out a warning, but his headless guard kept shunting him backwards towards the wall, blocking his every attempt to get out from behind it. \"Indeed, your failure to understand that there are things much worse than death has always been your greatest weakness\" Another jet of green light flew from behind the silver shield. This time it was the one-armed centaur, galloping in front of Dumbledore, that took the blast and shattered into a hundred pieces, but before the fragments had even hit the floor, Dumbledore had drawn back his wand and waved it as though brandishing a whip. A long thin flame flew from the tip; it wrapped itself around Voldemort, shield and all. For a moment, it seemed Dumbledore had won, but then the fiery rope became a serpent, which relinquished its hold on Voldemort at once and turned, hissing furiously, to face Dumbledore. Voldemort vanished; the snake reared from the floor, ready to strike. There was a burst of flame in midair above Dumbledore just as Voldemort reappeared, standing on the plinth in the middle of the pool where so recently the five statues had stood. \"Look out!\" Harry yelled. But even as he shouted, another jet of green light flew at Dumbledore from Voldemort’s wand and the snake had struck. Fawkes swooped down in front of Dumbledore, opened his beak wide and swallowed the jet of green light whole: he burst into flame and fell to the floor, small, wrinkled and flightless. At the same moment, Dumbledore brandished his wand in one long, fluid movement - the snake, which had been an instant from sinking its fangs into him, flew high into the air and vanished in a wisp of dark smoke; and the water in the pool rose up and covered Voldemort like a cocoon of molten glass. For a few seconds Voldemort was visible only as a dark, rippling, faceless figure, shimmering and indistinct upon the plinth, clearly struggling to throw off the suffocating mass. Then he was gone and the water fell with a crash back into its pool, slopping wildly over the sides, drenching the polished floor. \"MASTER!\" screamed Bellatrix. Sure it was over, sure Voldemort had decided to flee, Harry made to run out from behind his statue guard, but Dumbledore bellowed: \"Stay where you are, Harry!\" For the first time, Dumbledore sounded frightened. Harry could not see why: the hall was quite empty but for themselves, the sobbing Bellatrix still trapped under the witch statue, and the baby phoenix Fawkes croaking feebly on the floor And then Harry's scar burst open and he knew he was dead: it was pain beyond imagining, pain past endurance. He was gone from the hall, he was locked in the coils of a creature with red eyes, so tightly bound that Harry did not know where his body ended and the creature’s began: they were fused together, bound by pain, and there was no escape And when the creature spoke, it used Harry’s mouth, so that in his agony he felt his jaw move \"Kill me now, Dumbledore...\" Blinded and dying, every part of him screaming for release, Harry felt the creature use him again... \"If death is nothing, Dumbledore, kill the boy...\" Let the pain stop, thought Harry... let him kill us... end it, Dumbledore... death is nothing compared to this... And I’ll see Sirius again... And as Harry’s heart filled with emotion, the creature’s coils loosened, the pain was gone; Harry was lying face down on the floor, his glasses gone, shivering as though he lay upon ice, not wood... And there were voices echoing through the hall, more voices than there should have been... Harry opened his eyes, saw his glasses lying by the heel of the headless statue that had been guarding him, but which now lay flat on its back, cracked and immobile. He put them on and raised his head a little to find Dumbledore’s crooked nose inches from his own. \"Are you all right, Harry?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry, shaking so violently he could not hold his head up properly. \"Yeah, I’m - where’s Voldemort, where - who are all these - what’s -\" The Atrium was full of people; the floor was reflecting the emerald green flames that had burst into life in all the fireplaces along one wall; and streams of witches and wizards were emerging from them. As Dumbledore pulled him back to his feet, Harry saw the tiny gold statues of the house-elf and the goblin, leading a stunned-looking Cornelius Fudge forward. \"He was there!\" shouted a scarlet-robed man with a ponytail, who was pointing at a pile of golden rubble on the other side of the hall, where Bellatrix had lain trapped only moments before. \"I saw him, Mr. Fudge, I swear it was You-Know-Who, he grabbed a woman and Disapparated!\" \"I know, Williamson, I know, I saw him too!\" gibbered Fudge, who was wearing pajamas under his pinstriped cloak and was gasping as though he had just run miles. \"Merlin’s beard - here - here! - in the Ministry of Magic! - great heavens above - it doesn’t seem possible - my word - how can this be -?\" \"If you proceed downstairs into the Department of Mysteries, Cornelius,\" said Dumbledore - apparently satisfied that Harry was all right, and walking forwards so that the newcomers realized he was there for the first time (a few of them raised their wands; others simply looked amazed; the statues of the elf and goblin applauded and Fudge jumped so much that his slipperclad feet left the floor) - \"you will find several escaped Death Eaters contained in the Death Chamber, bound by an Anti-Disapparation Jinx and awaiting your decision as to what to do with them.\" \"Dumbledore!\" gasped Fudge, beside himself with amazement. \"You-here-I-I\" He looked wildly around at the Aurors he had brought with him and it could not have been clearer that he was in half a mind to cry, \"Seize him!\" \"Cornelius, I am ready to fight your men - and win, again!\" said Dumbledore in a thunderous voice. \"But a few minutes ago you saw proof, with your own eyes, that I have been telling you the truth for a year. Lord Voldemort has returned, you have been chasing the wrong man for twelve months, and it is time - you listened to sense!\" \"I - don’t - well\" blustered Fudge, looking around as though hoping somebody was going to tell him what to do. When nobody did, he said, \"Very well - Dawlish! Williamson! Go down to the Department of Mysteries and see... Dumbledore, you - you will need to tell me exactly - the Fountain of Magical Brethren - what happened?\" he added in a kind of whimper, staring around at the floor, where the remains of the statues of the witch, wizard and centaur now lay scattered. \"We can discuss that after I have sent Harry back to Hogwarts,\" said Dumbledore. \"Harry - Harry Potter?\" Fudge wheeled around and stared at Harry, who was still standing against the wall beside the fallen statue that had guarded him during Dumbledore and Voldemort’s duel. \"He - here?\" said Fudge, goggling at Harry. \"Why - what’s all this about?\" \"I shall explain everything,\" repeated Dumbledore, \"when Harry is back at school.\" He walked away from the pool to the place where the golden wizard’s head lay on the floor. He pointed his wand at it and muttered, \"Portus.\" The head glowed blue and trembled noisily against the wooden floor for a few seconds, then became still once more. \"Now see here, Dumbledore!\" said Fudge, as Dumbledore picked up the head and walked back to Harry carrying it. \"You haven’t got authorization for that Portkey! You can’t do things like that right in front of the Minister for Magic, you - you\" His voice faltered as Dumbledore surveyed him magisterially over his half-moon spectacles. \"You will give the order to remove Dolores Umbridge from Hogwarts,\" said Dumbledore. \"You will tell your Aurors to stop searching for my Care of Magical Creatures teacher so that he can return to work. I will give you...\" Dumbledore pulled a watch with twelve hands from his pocket and surveyed it... \"half an hour of my time tonight, in which I think we shall be more than able to cover the important points of what has happened here. After that, I shall need to return to my school. If you need more help from me you are, of course, more than welcome to contact me at Hogwarts. Letters addressed to the Headmaster will find me.\" Fudge goggled worse than ever; his mouth was open and his round face grew pinker under his rumpled grey hair. \"I - you\" Dumbledore turned his back on him. \"Take this Portkey, Harry.\" He held out the golden head of the statue and Harry placed his hand on it, past caring what he did next or where he went. \"I shall see you in half an hour,\" said Dumbledore quietly \"One... two... three...\" Harry felt the familiar sensation of a hook being jerked behind his navel. The polished wooden floor was gone from beneath his feet; the Atrium, Fudge and Dumbledore had all disappeared and he was flying forwards in a whirlwind of color and sound... \n",

            " THIRTYTHREE  THE DEATH EATERS Voldemort looked away from Harry and began examining his own body. His hands were like large, pale spiders; his long white fingers caressed his own chest, his arms, his face; the red eyes, whose pupils were slits, like a cats, gleamed still more brightly through the darkness. He held up his hands and flexed the fingers, his expression rapt and exultant. He took not the slightest notice of Wormtail, who lay twitching and bleeding on the ground, nor of the great snake, which had slithered back into sight and was circling Harry again, hissing. Voldemort slipped one of those unnaturally longfingered hands into a deep pocket and drew out a wand. He caressed it gently too; and then he raised it, and pointed it at Wormtail, who was lifted off the ground and thrown against the headstone where Harry was tied; he fell to the foot of it and lay there, crumpled up and crying. Voldemort turned his scarlet eyes upon Harry, laughing a high, cold, mirthless laugh. Wormtail's robes were shining with blood now; he had wrapped the stump of his arm in them. \"My Lord . . .\" he choked, \"my Lord . . . you promised . . . you did promise ...\" \"Hold out your arm,\" said Voldemort lazily. \"Oh Master . . . thank you, Master ...\" He extended the bleeding stump, but Voldemort laughed again. \"The other arm, Wormtail.\" \"Master, please . . .please ...\" Voldemort bent down and pulled out Wormtail's left arm; he forced the sleeve of Wormtail's robes up past his elbow, and Harry saw something upon the skin there, something like a vivid red tattoo  a skull with a snake protruding from its mouth  the image that had appeared in the sky at the Quidditch World Cup: the Dark Mark. Voldemort examined it carefully, ignoring Wormtail's uncontrollable weeping. \"It is back,\" he said softly, \"they will all have noticed it... and now, we shall see ... now we shall know ...\" He pressed his long white forefinger to the brand on Wormtail's arm. The scar on Harry s forehead seared with a sharp pain again, and Wormtail let out a fresh howl; Voldemort removed his fingers from Wormtail's mark, and Harry saw that it had turned jet black. A look of cruel satisfaction on his face, Voldemort straightened up, threw back his head, and stared around at the dark graveyard. \"How many will be brave enough to return when they feel it?\" he whispered, his gleaming red eyes fixed upon the stars. \"And how many will be foolish enough to stay away?\" He began to pace up and down before Harry and Wormtail, eyes sweeping the graveyard all the while. After a minute or so, he looked down at Harry again, a cruel smile twisting his snakelike face. \"You stand, Harry Potter, upon the remains of my late father,\" he hissed softly. \"A Muggle and a fool. . . very like your dear mother. But they both had their uses, did they not? Your mother died to defend you as a child . . . and I killed my father, and see how useful he has proved himself, in death. ...\" Voldemort laughed again. Up and down he paced, looking all around him as he walked, and the snake continued to circle in the grass. \"You see that house upon the hillside, Potter? My father lived there. My mother, a witch who lived here in this village, fell in love with him. But he abandoned her when she told him what she was. ... He didn't like magic, my father . . . \"He left her and returned to his Muggle parents before I was even born. Potter, and she died giving birth to me, leaving me to be raised in a Muggle orphanage . . . but I vowed to find him ... I revenged myself upon him, that fool who gave me his name . . . Tom Riddle. . . .\" Still he paced, his red eyes darting from grave to grave. \"Listen to me, reliving family history . . .\" he said quietly, \"why, I am growing quite sentimental. . . . But look, Harry! My true family returns. . . .\" The air was suddenly full of the swishing of cloaks. Between graves, behind the yew tree, in every shadowy space, wizards were Apparating. All of them were hooded and masked. And one by one they moved forward . . . slowly, cautiously, as though they could hardly believe their eyes Voldemort stood in silence, waiting for them. Then one of the Death Eaters fell to his knees, crawled toward Voldemort and kissed the hem of his black robes. Master . . . Master \" he murmured. The Death Eaters behind him did the same; each of them approaching Voldemort on his knees and kissing his robes, before backing away and standing up, forming a silent circle, which enclosed Tom Riddle s grave, Harry, Voldemort, and the sobbing and twitching heap that was Wormtail. Yet they left gaps in the circle, as though waiting for more people. Voldemort, however, did not seem to expect more. He looked around at the hooded faces, and though there was no wind rustling seemed to run around the circle, as though it had shivered. \"Welcome, Death Eaters,\" said Voldemort quietly. \"Thirteen years. . . thirteen years since last we met. Yet you answer my call as though it were yesterday, we are still united under the Dark Mark, then! Or are we?\" He put back his terrible face and sniffed, his slitlike nostrils widening. \"I smell guilt,\" he said. \"There is a stench or guilt upon the air. A second shiver ran around the circle, as though each member of it longed, but did not dare to step back from him. \"I see you all, whole and healthy, with your powers intact  such prompt appearances! and I ask myself . . . why did this band of wizards never come to the aid of their master, to whom they swore eternal loyalty?\" No one spoke. No one moved except Wormtail, who was upon the ground, still sobbing over his bleeding arm. \"And I answer myself,\" whispered Voldemort, \"they must have believed me broken, they thought I was gone. They slipped back among my enemies, and they pleaded innocence, and ignorance, and bewitchment. . . . \"And then I ask myself, but how could they have believed I would not rise again! They, who knew the steps I took, long ago, to guard myself against mortal death! They, who had seen proofs of the immensity of my power in the times when I was mightier than any wizard living! \"And I answer myself, perhaps they believed a still greater power could exist, one that could vanquish even Lord Voldemort. . . perhaps they now pay allegiance to another . . . perhaps that champion of commoners, of Mudbloods and Muggles, Albus Dumbledore?\" At the mention of Dumbledore's name, the members of the circle stirred, and some muttered and shook their heads. Voldemort ignored them. \"It is a disappointment to me ... I confess myself disappointed. . . .\" One of the men suddenly flung himself forward, breaking the circle. Trembling from head to foot, he collapsed at Voldemort's feet. \"Master!\" he shrieked, \"Master, forgive me! Forgive us all!\" Voldemort began to laugh. He raised his wand. \"Crucio!\" The Death Eater on the ground writhed and shrieked; Harry was sure the sound must carry to the houses around. . . . Let the police come, he thought desperately . . . anyone . .. anything. . . Voldemort raised his wand. The tortured Death Eater lay flat upon the ground, gasping. \"Get up, Avery,\" said Voldemort softly. \"Stand up. You ask for forgiveness? I do not forgive. I do not forget. Thirteen long years ... I want thirteen years' repayment before I forgive you. Wormtail here has paid some of his debt already, have you not, Wormtail?\" He looked down at Wormtail, who continued to sob. \"You returned to me, not out of loyalty, but out of fear of your old friends. You deserve this pain, Wormtail. You know that, don't you?\" \"Yes, Master,\" moaned Wormtail, \"please. Master . . . please ...\" \"Yet you helped return me to my body,\" said Voldemort coolly, watching Wormtail sob on the ground. \"Worthless and traitorous as you are, you helped me ... and Lord Voldemort rewards his helpers... .\" Voldemort raised his wand again and whirled it through the air. A streak of what looked like molten silver hung shining in the wand's wake. Momentarily shapeless, it writhed and then formed itself into a gleaming replica of a human hand, bright as moonlight, which soared downward and fixed itself upon Wormtails bleeding wrist. Wormtail's sobbing stopped abruptly. His breathing harsh and ragged, he raised his head and stared in disbelief at the silver hand, now attached seamlessly to his arm, as though he were wearing a dazzling glove. He flexed the shining fingers, then, trembling, picked up a small twig on the ground and crushed it into powder. \"My Lord,\" he whispered. \"Master ... it is beautiful. . . thank you... thank you. ...\" He scrambled forward on his knees and kissed the hem of Voldemort's robes. \"May your loyalty never waver again, Wormtail,\" said Voldemort. \"No, my Lord . . . never, my Lord . . .\" Wormtail stood up and took his place in the circle, staring at his powerful new hand, his face still shining with tears. Voldemort now approached the man on Wormtail's right. \"Lucius, my slippery friend,\" he whispered, halting before him. \"I am told that you have not renounced the old ways, though to the world you present a respectable face. You are still ready to take the lead in a spot of Muggletorture, I believe? Yet you never tried to find me, Lucius. . . . Your exploits at the Quidditch World Cup were fun, I daresay. . . but might not your energies have been better directed toward finding and aiding your master?\" \"My Lord, I was constantly on the alert,\" came Lucius Malfoy's voice swiftly from beneath the hood. \"Had there been any sign from you, any whisper of your whereabouts, I would have been at your side immediately, nothing could have prevented me \" \"And yet you ran from my Mark, when a faithful Death Eater sent it into the sky last summer?\" said Voldemort lazily, and Mr. Malfoy stopped talking abruptly. \"Yes, I know all about that, Lucius. . . . You have disappointed me. ... I expect more faithful service in the future.\" \"Of course, my Lord, of course. . . . You are merciful, thank you. ...\" Voldemort moved on, and stopped, staring at the space  large enough for two people  that separated Malfoy and the next man. \"The Lestranges should stand here,\" said Voldemort quietly. \"But they are entombed in Azkaban. They were faithful. They went to Azkaban rather than renounce me. . . . When Azkaban is broken open, the Lestranges will be honored beyond their dreams. The dementors will join us ... they are our natural allies ... we will recall the banished giants ... I shall have all my devoted servants returned to me, and an army of creatures whom all fear. ...\" He walked on. Some of the Death Eaters he passed in silence, but he paused before others and spoke to them. \"Macnair . . . destroying dangerous beasts for the Ministry of Magic now, Wormtail tells me? You shall have better victims than that soon, Macnair. Lord Voldemort will provide. ...\" \"Thank you, Master . . . thank you,\" murmured Macnair. \"And here\"  Voldemort moved on to the two largest hooded figures  \"we have Crabbe . . . you will do better this time, will you not, Crabbe? And you, Goyle?\" They bowed clumsily, muttering dully. \"Yes, Master ...\" \"We will, Master....\" \"The same goes for you, Nott,\" said Voldemort quietly as he walked past a stooped figure in Mr. Goyles shadow. \"My Lord, I prostrate myself before you, I am your most faithful \" \"That will do,\" said Voldemort. He had reached the largest gap of all, and he stood surveying it with his blank, red eyes, as though he could see people standing there. \"And here we have six missing Death Eaters . . . three dead in my service. One, too cowardly to return ... he will pay. One, who I believe has left me forever ... he will be killed, of course . . . and one, who remains my most faithful servant, and who has already reentered my service.\" The Death Eaters stirred, and Harry saw their eyes dart sideways at one another through their masks. \"He is at Hogwarts, that faithful servant, and it was through his efforts that our young friend arrived here tonight. . . . \"Yes,\" said Voldemort, a grin curling his lipless mouth as the eyes of the circle flashed in Harry's direction. \"Harry Potter has kindly joined us for my rebirthing party. One might go so far as to call him my guest of honor.\" There was a silence. Then the Death Eater to the right of Wormtail stepped forward, and Lucius Malfoy's voice spoke from under the mask. \"Master, we crave to know ... we beg you to tell us ... how you have achieved this . . . this miracle . . . how you managed to return to us. .. .\" \"Ah, what a story it is, Lucius,\" said Voldemort. \"And it begins  and ends  with my young friend here.\" He walked lazily over to stand next to Harry, so that the eyes of the whole circle were upon the two of them. The snake continued to circle. \"You know, of course, that they have called this boy my downfall?\" Voldemort said softly, his red eyes upon Harry, whose scar began to burn so fiercely that he almost screamed in agony. \"You all know that on the night I lost my powers and my body, I tried to kill him. His mother died in the attempt to save him  and unwittingly provided him with a protection I admit I had not foreseen. ... I could not touch the boy.\" Voldemort raised one of his long white fingers and put it very close to Harry's cheek. \"His mother left upon him the traces other sacrifice. . . . This is old magic, I should have remembered it, I was foolish to overlook it... but no matter. I can touch him now.\" Harry felt the cold tip of the long white finger touch him, and thought his head would burst with the pain. Voldemort laughed softly in his ear, then took the finger away and continued addressing the Death Eaters. \"I miscalculated, my friends, I admit it. My curse was deflected by the woman's foolish sacrifice, and it rebounded upon myself. Aaah . . . pain beyond pain, my friends; nothing could have prepared me for it. I was ripped from my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost. . . but still, I was alive. What I was, even I do not know... I, who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality. You know my goal  to conquer death. And now, I was tested, and it appeared that one or more of my experiments had worked ... for I had not been killed, though the curse should have done it. Nevertheless, I was as powerless as the weakest creature alive, and without the means to help myself... for I had no body, and every spell that might have helped me required the use of a wand. . . . \"I remember only forcing myself, sleeplessly, endlessly, second by second, to exist. ... I settled in a faraway place, in a forest, and I waited. . . . Surely, one of my faithful Death Eaters would try and find me. . . one of them would come and perform the magic I could not, to restore me to a body . . , but I waited in vain. ...\" The shiver ran once more around the circle of listening Death Eaters. Voldemort let the silence spiral horribly before continuing. \"Only one power remained to me. I could possess the bodies of others. But I dared not go where other humans were plentiful, for I knew that the Aurors were still abroad and searching for me. I sometimes inhabited animals  snakes, of course, being my preference  but I was little better off inside them than as pure spirit, for their bodies were ill adapted to perform magic . . . and my possession of them shortened their lives; none of them lasted long. . . . \"Then . . . four years ago . . . the means for my return seemed assured. A wizard  young, foolish, and gullible  wandered across my path in the forest I had made my home. Oh, he seemed the very chance I had been dreaming of... for he was a teacher at Dumbledore's school... he was easy to bend to my will... he brought me back to this country, and after a while, I took possession of his body, to supervise him closely as he carried out my orders. But my plan failed. I did not manage to steal the Sorcerer's Stone. I was not to be assured immortal life. I was thwarted . . . thwarted, once again, by Harry Potter. ...\" Silence once more; nothing was stirring, not even the leaves on the yew tree. The Death Eaters were quite motionless, the glittering eyes in their masks fixed upon Voldemort, and upon Harry. \"The servant died when I left his body, and I was left as weak as ever I had been,\" Voldemort continued. \"I returned to my hiding place far away, and I will not pretend to you that I didn't then fear that I might never regain my powers. . . . Yes, that was perhaps my darkest hour... I could not hope that I would be sent another wizard to possess . . . and I had given up hope, now, that any of my Death Eaters cared what had become of me. ...\" One or two of the masked wizards in the circle moved uncomfortably, but Voldemort took no notice. \"And then, not even a year ago, when I had almost abandoned hope, it happened at last... a servant returned to me. Wormtail here, who had faked his own death to escape justice, was driven out of hiding by those he had once counted friends, and decided to return to his master. He sought me in the country where it had long been rumored I was hiding . . . helped, of course, by the rats he met along the way. Wormtail has a curious affinity with rats, do you not, Wormtail? His filthy little friends told him there was a place, deep in an Albanian forest, that they avoided, where small animals like themselves had met their deaths by a dark shadow that possessed them. . . . \"But his journey back to me was not smooth, was it, Wormtail? For, hungry one night, on the edge of the very forest where he had hoped to find me, he foolishly stopped at an inn for some food . . . and who should he meet there, but one Bertha Jorkins, a witch from the Ministry of Magic. \"Now see the way that fate favors Lord Voldemort. This might have been the end of Wormtail, and of my last hope for regeneration. But Wormtail  displaying a presence of mind I would never have expected from him  convinced Bertha Jorkins to accompany him on a nighttime stroll. He overpowered her ... he brought her to me. And Bertha Jorkins, who might have ruined all, proved instead to be a gift beyond my wildest dreams ... for  with a little persuasion  she became a veritable mine of information. \"She told me that the Triwizard Tournament would be played at Hogwarts this year. She told me that she knew of a faithful Death Eater who would be only too willing to help me, if I could only contact him. She told me many things. . . but the means I used to break the Memory Charm upon her were powerful, and when I had extracted all useful information from her, her mind and body were both damaged beyond repair. She had now served her purpose. I could not possess her. I disposed of her.\" Voldemort smiled his terrible smile, his red eyes blank and pitiless. \"Wormtail's body, of course, was ill adapted for possession, as all assumed him dead, and would attract far too much attention if noticed. However, he was the ablebodied servant I needed, and, poor wizard though he is, Wormtail was able to follow the instructions I gave him, which would return me to a rudimentary, weak body of my own, a body I would be able to inhabit while awaiting the essential ingredients for true rebirth ... a spell or two of my own invention ... a little help from my dear Nagini,\" Voldemorts red eyes fell upon the continually circling snake, \"a potion concocted from unicorn blood, and the snake venom Nagini provided ... I was soon returned to an almost human form, and strong enough to travel. \"There was no hope of stealing the Sorcerer's Stone anymore, for I knew that Dumbledore would have seen to it that it was destroyed. But I was willing to embrace mortal life again, before chasing immortality. I set my sights lower ... I would settle for my old body back again, and my old strength. \"I knew that to achieve this  it is an old piece of Dark Magic, the potion that revived me tonight  I would need three powerful ingredients. Well, one of them was already at hand, was it not, Wormtail? Flesh given by a servant. . . . \"My father's bone, naturally, meant that we would have to come here, where he was buried. But the blood of a foe ... Wormtail would have had me use any wizard, would you not, Wormtail? Any wizard who had hated me ... as so many of them still do. But I knew the one I must use, if I was to rise again, more powerful than I had been when I had fallen. I wanted Harry Potters blood. I wanted the blood of the one who had stripped me of power thirteen years ago . . . for the lingering protection his mother once gave him would then reside in my veins too. . \"But how to get at Harry Potter? For he has been better protected than I think even he knows, protected in ways devised by Dumbledore long ago, when it fell to him to arrange the boy's future. Dumbledore invoked an ancient magic, to ensure the boy's protection as long as he is in his relations' care. Not even I can touch him there. . . . Then, of course, there was the Quidditch World Cup. ... I thought his protection might be weaker there, away from his relations and Dumbledore, but I was not yet strong enough to attempt kidnap in the midst of a horde of Ministry wizards. And then, the boy would return to Hogwarts, where he is under the crooked nose of that Muggleloving fool from morning until night. So how could I take him! \"Why ... by using Bertha Jorkins's information, of course. Use my one faithful Death Eater, stationed at Hogwarts, to ensure that the boy's name was entered into the Goblet of Fire. Use my Death Eater to ensure that the boy won the tournament  that he touched the Triwizard Cup first  the cup which my Death Eater had turned into a Portkey, which would bring him here, beyond the reach of Dumbledore's help and protection, and into my waiting arms. And here he is ... the boy you all believed had been my downfall. ...\" Voldemort moved slowly forward and turned to face Harry. He raised his wand. \"Crucio!\" It was pain beyond anything Harry had ever experienced; his very bones were on fire; his head was surely splitting along his scar; his eyes were rolling madly in his head; he wanted it to end ... to black out... to die ... And then it was gone. He was hanging limply in the ropes binding him to the headstone of Voldemort's father, looking up into those bright red eyes through a kind of mist. The night was ringing with the sound of the Death Eaters' laughter. \"You see, I think, how foolish it was to suppose that this boy could ever have been stronger than me,\" said Voldemort. \"But I want there to be no mistake in anybody's mind. Harry Potter escaped me by a lucky chance. And I am now going to prove my power by killing him, here and now, in front of you all, when there is no Dumbledore to help him, and no mother to die for him. I will give him his chance. He will be allowed to fight, and you will be left in no doubt which of us is the stronger. Just a little longer, Nagini,\" he whispered, and the snake glided away through the grass to where the Death Eaters stood watching. \"Now untie him, Wormtail, and give him back his wand.\" \n",

            "-Five King’s Cross He lay facedown, listening to the silence. He was perfectly alone. Nobody was watching. Nobody else was there. He was not perfectly sure that he was there himself. A long time later, or maybe no time at all, it came to him that he must exist, must be more than disembodied thought, because he was lying, definitely lying, on some surface. Therefore he had a sense of touch, and the thing against which he lay existed too. Almost as soon as he had reached this conclusion, Harry became conscious that he was naked. Convinced as he was of his total solitude, this did not concern him, but it did intrigue him slightly. He wondered whether, as he could feel, he would be able to see. In opening them, he discovered that he had eyes. He lay in a bright mist, though it was not like mist he had ever experienced before. His surroundings were not hidden by cloudy vapor; rather the cloudy vapor had not yet formed into surroundings. The floor on which he lay seemed to be white, neither warm nor cold, but simply there, a flat, blank something on which to be. He sat up. His body appeared unscathed. He touched his face. He was not wearing glasses anymore. Then a noise reached him through the unformed nothingness that surrounded him: the small soft thumpings of something that flapped, flailed, and struggled. It was a pitiful noise, yet also slightly indecent. He had the uncomfortable feeling that he was eavesdropping on something furtive, shameful. For the first time, he wished he were clothed. Barely had the wish formed in his head than robes appeared a short distance away. He took them and pulled them on. They were soft, clean, and warm. It was extraordinary how they had appeared just like that, the moment he had wanted them. . . . He stood up, looking around. Was he in some great Room of Requirement? The longer he looked, the more there was to see. A great domed glass roof glittered high above him in sunlight. Perhaps it was a palace. All was hushed and still, except for those odd thumping and whimpering noises coming from somewhere close by in the mist. . . . Harry turned slowly on the spot, and his surroundings seemed to invent themselves before his eyes. A wide-open space, bright and clean, a hall larger by far than the Great Hall, with that clear domed glass ceiling. It was quite empty. He was the only person there, except for - He recoiled. He had spotted the thing that was making the noises. It had the form of a small, naked child, curled on the ground, its skin raw and rough, flayed-looking, and it lay shuddering under a seat where it had been left, unwanted, stuffed out of sight, struggling for breath. He was afraid of it. Small and fragile and wounded though it was, he did not want to approach it. Nevertheless he drew slowly nearer, ready to jump back at any moment. Soon he stood near enough to touch it, yet he could not bring himself to do it. He felt like a coward. He ought to comfort it, but it repulsed him. \"You cannot help.\" He spun around. Albus Dumbledore was walking toward him, sprightly and upright, wearing sweeping robes of midnight blue. \"Harry.\" He spread his arms wide, and his hands were both whole and white and undamaged. \"You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk.\" Stunned, Harry followed as Dumbledore strode away from where the flayed child lay whimpering, leading him to two seats that Harry had not previously noticed, set some distance away under that high, sparkling ceiling. Dumbledore sat down in one of them, and Harry fell into the other, staring at his old headmaster’s face. Dumbledore’s long silver hair and beard, the piercingly blue eyes behind half-moon spectacles, the crooked nose: Everything was as he had remembered it. And yet . . . \"But you’re dead,\" said Harry. \"Oh yes,\" said Dumbledore matter-of-factly. \"Then . . . I’m dead too?\" \"Ah,\" said Dumbledore, smiling still more broadly. \"That is the question, isn’t it? On the whole, dear boy, I think not.\" They looked at each other, the old man still beaming. \"Not?\" repeated Harry. \"Not,\" said Dumbledore. \"But . . .\" Harry raised his hand instinctively toward the lightning scar. It did not seem to be there. \"But I should have died - I didn’t defend myself! I meant to let him kill me!\" \"And that,\" said Dumbledore, \"will, I think, have made all the difference.\" Happiness seemed to radiate from Dumbledore like light; like fire: Harry had never seen the man so utterly, so palpably content. \"Explain,\" said Harry. \"But you already know,\" said Dumbledore. He twiddled his thumbs together. \"I let him kill me,\" said Harry. \"Didn’t I?\" \"You did,\" said Dumbledore, nodding. \"Go on!\" \"So the part of his soul that was in me . . .\" Dumbledore nodded still more enthusiastically, urging Harry onward, a broad smile of encouragement on his face. \". . . has it gone?\" \"Oh yes!\" said Dumbledore. \"Yes, he destroyed it. Your soul is whole, and completely your own, Harry.\" \"But then . . .\" Harry trembled over his shoulder to where the small, maimed creature trembled under the chair. \"What is that, Professor?\" \"something that is beyond either of our help,\" said Dumbledore. \"But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,\" Harry started again, \"and nobody died for me this time - how can I be alive?\" \"I think you know,\" said Dumbledore. \"Think back. Remember what he did, in his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.\" Harry thought. He let his gaze drift over his surroundings. If it was indeed a palace in which they sat, it was an odd one, with chairs set in little rows and bits of railing here and there, and still, he and Dumbledore and the stunted creatures under the chair were the only beings there. Then the answer rose to his lips easily, without effort. \"He took my blood,\" said Harry. \"Precisely!\" said Dumbledore. \"He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily’s protection inside both of you! He thethered you to life while he lives!\" \"I live . . . while he lives? But I thought . . . I thought it was the other way around! I thought we both had to die? Or is it the same thing?\" He was distracted by the whimpering and thumping of the agonized creature behind them and glanced back at it yet again. \"Are you sure we can’t do anything?\" \"There is no help possible.\" \"Then explain . . . more,\" said Harry, and Dumbledore smiled. \"You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry, the Horcrux he never meant to make. He had rendered his soul so unstable that it broke apart when he committed those acts of unspeakable evil, the murder of your parents, the attempted killing of a child. But what escaped from that room was even less than he knew. He left more than his body behind. He left part of himself latched to you, the would-be victim who had survived. \"And his knowledge remained woefully incomplete, Harry! That which Voldemort does not value, he takes no trouble to comprehend. Of house-elves and children’s tales, of love, loyalty, and innocence, Voldemort knows and understands nothing. Nothing. That they all have a power beyond his own, a power beyond the reach of any magic, is a truth he has never grasped. \"He took your blood believing it would strengthen him. He took into his body a tiny part of the enchantment your mother laid upon you when she died for you. His body keeps her sacrafice alive, and while that enchantment survives, so do you and so does Voldemort’s one last hope for himself.\" Dumbledore smiled at Harry, and Harry stared at him. \"And you knew this? You knew - all along?\" \"I guessed. But my guesses have usually been good,\" said Dumbledore happily, and they sat in silence for what seemed like a long time, while the creature behind them continued to whimper and tremble. \"There’s more,\" said Harry. \"There’s more to it. Why did my wand break the wand he borrowed?\" \"As to that, I cannot be sure.\" \"Have a guess, then,\" said Harry, and Dumbledore laughed. \"What you must understand, Harry, is that you and Lord Voldemort have journeyed together into realms of magic hitherto unknown and untested. But here is what I think happened, and it is unprecedented, and no wandmaker could, I think, ever have predicted or explained it to Voldemort. \"Without meaning to, as you now know, Lord Voldemort doubled the bond between you when he returned to a human form. A part of his soul was still attached to yours, and, thinking to strengthen himself, he took a part of your mother’s sacrafice into himself. If he could only have understood the precise and terrible power of that sacrifice, he would not, perhaps, have dared to touch your blood. . . . But then, if he had been able to understand, he could not be Lord Voldemort, and might never have murdered at all. \"Having ensured this two-fold connection, having wrapped your destinies together more securely than ever two wizards were joined in history, Voldemort proceeded to attack you with a wand that shared a core with yours. And now something very strange happened, as we know. The cores reacted in a way that Lord Voldemort, who never knew that your wand was a twin of his, had ever expected. \"He was more afraid than you were that night, Harry. You had accepted, even embraced, the possibility of death, something Lord Voldemort has never been able to do. Your courage won, your wand overpowered his. And in doing so, something happened between those wands, something that echoed the relationship between their masters. \"I believe that your wand imbibed some of the power and qualities of Voldemort’s wand that night, which is to say that it contained a little of Voldemort himself. So your wand recognized him when he pursued you, recognized a man who was both kin and mortal enemy, and it regurgitated some of his own magic against him, magic much more powerful than anything Lucius’s wand had ever performed. Your wand now contained the power of your enormous courage and of Voldemort’s own deadly skill: What chance did that poor stick of Lucius Malfoy’s stand?\" \"But if my wand was so powerful, how come Hermione was able to break it?\" asked Harry. \"My dear boy, its remarkable effects were directed only at Voldemort, who had tampered so ill-advisedly with the deepest laws of magic. Only toward him was that wand abnormally powerful. Otherwise it was a wand like any other . . . though a good one, I am sure,\" Dumbledore finished kindly. Harry sat in thought for a long time, or perhaps seconds. It was very hard to be sure of things like time, here. \"He killed me with your wand.\" \"He failed to kill you with my wand,\" Dumbledore corrected Harry. \"I think we can agree that you are not dead - though, of course,\" he added, as if fearing he had been discourteous, \"I do not minimize your sufferings, which I am sure were severe.\" \"I feel great at the moment, though,\" said Harry, looking down at his clean, unblemished hands. \"Where are we, exactly?\" \"Well, I was going to ask you that,\" said Dumbledore, looking around. \"Where would you say that we are?\" Until Dumbledore had asked, Harry had not known. Now, however, he found that he had an answer ready to give. \"It looks,\" he said slowly, \"like King’s Cross station. Except a lo cleaner and empty, and there are no trains as far as I can see.\" \"King’s Cross station!\" Dumbledore was chuckling immoderately. \"Good gracious, really?\" \"Well, where do you think we are?\" asked Harry, a little defensively. \"My dear boy, I have no idea. This is, as they say, your party.\" Harry had no idea what this meant; Dumbledore was being infuriating. He glared at him, then remembered a much more pressing question than that of their current location. \"The Deathly Hallows,\" he said, and he was glad to see that the words wiped the smile from Dumbledore’s face. \"Ah, yes,\" he said. He even looked a little worried. \"Well?\" For the first time since Harry had met Dumbledore, he looked less than an old man, much less. He looked fleetingly like a small boy caught in wrongdoing. \"Can you forgive me?\" he said. \"Can you forgive me for not trusting you? For not telling you? Harry, I only feared that you would fail as I had failed. I only dreaded that you would make my mistakes. I crave your pardon, Harry. I have known, for some time now, that you are the better man.\" \"What are you talking about?\" asked Harry, startled by Dumbledore’s tone, by the sudden tears in his eyes. \"The Hallows, the Hallows,\" murmured Dumbledore. \"A desperate man’s dream!\" \"But they’re real!\" \"Real, and dangerous, and a lure for fools,\" said Dumbledore. \"And I was such a fool. But you know, don’t you? I have no secrets from you anymore. You know.\" \"What do I know?\" Dumbledore turned his whole body to face Harry, and tears still sparkled in the brilliantly blue eyes. \"Master of death, Harry, master of Death! Was I better, ultimately, than Voldemort?\" \"Of course you were,\" said Harry. \"Of course - how can you ask that? You never killed if you could avoid it!\" \"True, true,\" said Dumbledore, and he was like a child seeking reassurance. \"Yet I too sought a way to conquer death, Harry.\" \"Not the way he did,\" said Harry. After all his anger at Dumbledore, how odd it was to sit here, beneath the high, vaulted ceiling, and defend Dumbledore from himself. \"Hallows, not Horcruxes.\" \"Hallows,\" murmured Dumbledore, \"not Horcruxes. Precisely.\" There was a pause. The creature behind them whimpered, but Harry no longer looked around. \"Grindelwald was looking for them too?\" he asked. Dumbledore closed his eyes for a moment and nodded. \"It was the thing, above all, that drew us together,\" he said quietly. \"Two clever, arrogant boys with a shared obsession. He wanted to come to Godric’s Hollow, as I am sure you have guessed, because of the grave of Ignotus Peverell. He wanted to explore the place the third brother had died.\" \"So it’s true?\" asked Harry. \"All of it? The Peverell brothers -\" \"-were the three brothers of the tale,\" said Dumbledore, nodding. \"Oh yes, I think so. Whether they met Death on a lonely road . . . I think it more likely that the Peverell brothers were simply gifted, dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those powerful objects. The story of them being Death’s own Hallows seems to me the sort of legend that might have sprung up around such creations. \"The Cloak, as you know now, traveled down through the ages, father to son, mother to daughter, right down to Ignotus’s last living descendant, who was born, as Ignotus was, in the village of Godric’s Hollow.\" Dumbledore smiled at Harry. \"Me?\" \"You. You have guessed,, I know, why the Cloak was in my possession on the night your parents died. James had showed it to me just a few days previously. It explained much of his undetected wrongdoing at school! I could hardly believe what I was seeing. I asked to borrow it, to examine it. I had long since given up my dream of uniting the Hallows, but I could not resist, could not help taking a closer look. . . . It was a Cloak the likes of which I had never seen, immensely old, perfect in every respect . . . and then your father died, and I had two Hallows at last, all to myself!\" His tone was unbearably bitter. \"The Cloak wouldn’t have helped them survive, though,\" Harry said quickly. \"Voldemort knew where my mum and dad were. The Cloak couldn’t have made them curse-proof.\" \"true,\" sighed Dumbledore. \"True.\" Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not speak, so he prompted him. \"So you’d given up looking for the Hallows when you saw the Cloak?\" \"Oh yes,\" said Dumbledore faintly. It seemed that he forced himself to meet Harry’s eyes. \"You know what happened. You know. You cannot despise me more than I despise myself.\" \"But I don’t despise you -\" \"Then you should,\" said Dumbledore. He drew a deep breath. \"You know the secret of my sister’s ill health, what those Muggles did, what she became. You know how my poor father sought revenge, and paid the price, died In Azkaban. You know how my mother gave up her own life to care for Ariana. \"I resented it, Harry.\" Dumbledore stated it baldly, coldly. He was looking now over the top of Harry’s head, into the distance. \"I was gifted, I was brilliant. I wanted to escape. I wanted to shine. I wanted glory. \"Do not misunderstand me,\" he said, and pain crossed the face so that he looked ancient again. \"I loved them, I loved my parents, I loved my brother and my sister, but I was selfish, Harry, more selfish than you, who are a remarkably selfless person, could possibly imagine. \"So that, when my mother died, and I was left the responsibility of a damaged sister and a wayward brother, I returned to my village in anger and bitterness. Trapped and wasted, I thought! And then of course, he came. . . .\" Dumbledore looked directly into Harry’s eyes again. \"Grindelwald. You cannot imagine how his ideas caught me, Harry, inflamed me. Muggles forced into subservience. We wizards triumphant. Grindelwald and I, the glorious young leaders of the revolution. \"Oh, I had a few scruples. I assuaged my conscience with empty words. It would all be for the greater good, and any harm done would be repaid a hundredfold in benefits for wizards. Did I know, in my heart of hearts, what Gellert Grindelwald was? I think I did, but I closed my eyes. If the plans we were making came to fruition, all my dreams would come true. \"And at the heart of our schemes, the Deathly Hallows! How they fascinated him, how they fascinated both of us! The unbeatable wand, the weapon that would lead us to power! The Resurrection Stone - to him, though I pretended not to know it, it meant an army of Inferi! To me, I confess, it meant the return of my parents, and the lifting of all responsibility from my shoulders. \"And the Cloak . . . somehow, we never discussed the Cloak much, Harry. Both of us could conceal ourselves well enough without the Cloak, the true magic of which, of course, is that it can be used to protect and shield others as well as its owner. I thought that, if we ever found it, it might be useful in hiding Ariana, but our interest in the Cloak was mainly that it completed the trio, for the legend said that the man who had united all three objects would then be truly master of death, which we took to mean ‘invincible.’ \"Invincible masters of death, Grindelwald and Dumbledore! Two months of insanity, of cruel dreams, and neglect of the only two members of my family left to me. \"And then . . . you know what happened. Reality returned in the form of my rough, unlettered, and infinitely more admirable brother. I did not want to hear the truths he shouted at me. I did not want to hear that I could not set forth and seek Hallows with a fragile and unstable sister in tow. \"The argument became a fight. Grindelwald lost control. That which I had always sensed in him, though I pretended not to, now sprang into terrible being. And Ariana . . . after all my mother’s care and caution . . . lay dead upon the floor.\" Dumbledore gave a little gasp and began to cry in earnest. Harry reached out and was glad to find that he could touch him: He gripped his arm tightly and Dumbledore gradually regained control. \"Well, Grindelwald fled, as anyone but I could have predicted. He vanished, with his plans for seizing power, and his schemes for Muggle torture, and his dreams of the Deathly Hallows, dreams in which I had encouraged him and helped him. He ran, while I was left to bury my sister, and learn to live with my guilt and my terrible grief, the price of my shame. \"Years passed. There were rumors about him. They said he had procured a wand of immense power. I, meanwhile, was offered the post of Minister of Magic, not once, but several times. Naturally, I refused. I had learned that I was not to be trusted with power.\" \"But you’d have been better, much better, than Fudge or Scimgeour!\" burst out Harry. \"Would I?\" asked Dumbledore heavily. \"I am not so sure. I had proven, as a very young man, that power was my weakness and my temptation. It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those who, like you, have leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle because they must, and find to their own surprise that they wear it well. \"I was safer at Hogwarts. I think I was a good teacher -\" \"You were the best ---\" \"--- you are very kind, Harry. But while I busied myself with the training of young wizards, Grindelwald was raising an army. They say he feared me, and perhaps he did, but less, I think, than I feared him. \"Oh, not death,\" said Dumbledore, in answer to Harry’s questioning look. \"Not what he could do to me magically. I knew that we were evenly matched, perhaps that I was a shade more skillful. It was the truth I feared. You see, I never knew which of us, in that last, horrific fight, had actually cast the curse that killed my sister. You may call me cowardly: You would be right, Harry. I dreaded beyond all things the knowledge that it had been I who brought about her death, not merely through my arrogance and stupidity, but that I actually struck the blow that snuffed out her life. \"I think he knew it, I think he knew what frightened me. I delayed meeting him until finally, it would have been too shameful to resist any longer. People were dying and he seemed unstoppable, and I had to do what I could. \"Well, you know what happened next. I won the duel. I won the wand.\" Another silence. Harry did not ask whether Dumbledore had ever found out who struck Ariana dead. He did not want to know, and even less did he want Dumbledore to have to tell him. At last he knew what Dumbledore would have seen when he looked in the mirror of Erised, and why Dumbledore had been so understanding of the fascination it had exercised over Harry. They sat in silence for a long time, and the whipmerings of the creature behind them barely disturbed Harry anymore. At last he said, \"Grindelwald tried to stop Voldemort going after the wand. He lied, you know, pretended he had never had it.\" Dumbledore nodded, looking down at his lap, tears still glittering on the crooked nose. \"They say he showed remorse in later years, alone in his cell at Nurmengard. I hope that is true. I would like to think that he did feel the horror and shame of what he had done. Perhaps that lie to Voldemort was his attempt to make amends . . . to prevent Voldemort from taking the Hallow . . .\" \". . .or maybe from breaking into your tomb?\" suggested Harry, and Dumbledore dabbed his eyes. After another short pause Harry said, \"You tried to use the Resurrection Stone.\" Dumbledore nodded. \"When I discovered it, after all those years, buried in the abandoned home of the Gaunts --- the Hallow I had craved most of all, though in my youth I had wanted it for very different reasons --- I lost my head, Harry. I quite forgot that I was not a Horcrux, that the ring was sure to carry a curse. I picked it up, and I put it on, and for a second I imagined that I was about to see Ariana, and my mother, and my father, and to tell them how very, very sorry, I was. . . . \"I was such a fool, Harry. After all those years I had learned nothing. I was unworthy to unite the Deathly Hallows, I had proved it time and again, and here was final proof.\" \"Why?\" said Harry. \"It was natural! You wanted to see them again. What’s wrong with that?\" \"Maybe a man in a million could unite the Hallows, Harry. I was fit only to possess the meanest of them, the least extraordinary. I was fit to own the Elder Wand, and not boast of it, and not to kill with it. I was permitted to tame and use it, because I took it, not for gain, but to save others from it. \"But the Cloak, I took out of vain curiousity, and so it could never have worked for me as it works for you, its true owners. The stone I would have used in an attempt to drag back those who are at peace, rather than enable my self-sacrafice, as you did. You are the worthy possessor of the Hallows.\" Dumbledore patted Harry’s hand, and Harry looked up at the old man and smiled; he could not help himself. How coul dhe remain angry with Dumbledore now? \"Why did you have to make it so difficult?\" Dumbledore’s smile was tremulous. \"I am afraid I counted on Miss Granger to slow you up, Harry. I was afraid that your hot head might dominate your good heart. I was scared that, if presented outright with the facts about those tempting objects, you might seize the Hallows as I did, at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons. If you laid hands on them, I wanted you to possess them safely. You are the true master of death, because the true master does not seek to run away from Death. He accepts that he must die, and understands that there are far, far worse things in the living world than dying.\" \"And Voldemort never knew about the Hallows?\" \"I do not think so, because he did not recognize the Resurrection Stone he turned into a Horcrux. But even if he had known about them, Harry. I doubt that he woul dhave been interested in any except the first. He would not think that he needed the Cloak, and as for the stone, whom would he want to bring back from the dead? He fears the dead. He does not love.\" \"But you expected him to go after the wand?\" \"I have been sure that he would try, ever since your wand beat Voldemort’s in the graveyard of Little Hangleton. At first, he was afraid that you had conquered him by superior skill. Once he had kidnapped Ollivander, however, he discovered the existence of the twin cores. He thought that explained everything. Yet the borrowed wand did no better against yours! So Voldemort, instead of asking himself what quality it was in you that had made your wand so strong, what gift you possessed that he did not, naturally set out to find the one wand that, they said, would beat any other. For him, the Elder Wand has become an obsession to rival his obsession with you. He believes that the Elder Wand removes his last weakness and makes him truly invincible. Poor Severus . . .\" \"If you planned your death with Snape, you meant him to end up with the Elder Wand, didn’t you?\" \"I admit that was my intention,\" said Dumbledore, \"but it did not work as I intended, did it?\" \"No,\" said Harry. \"That bit didn’t work out.\" The creature behind them jerked and moaned, and Harry and Dumbledore sate without talking for the longest time yet. The realization of what would happen next settled gradually over Harry in the long minutes, like softly falling snow. \"I’ve got to go back, haven’t I?\" \"That is up to you.\" \"I’ve got a choice?\" \"Oh yes,\" Dumbledore smiled at him. \"We are in King’s Cross you say? I think that if you decided not to go back, you would be able to . . . let’s say . . . board a train.\" \"And where would it take me?\" \"On,\" said Dumbledore simply. Silence again. \"Voldemort’s got the Elder Wand.\" \"True. Voldemort has the Elder Wand.\" \"But you want me to go back?\" \"I think,\" said Dumbledore, \"that if you choose to return, there is a chance that he may be finished for good. I cannot promise it. But I know this, Harry, that you have less to fear from returning here than he does.\" Harry glanced again at the raw looking thing that trembled and choked in the shadow beneath the distant chair. \"Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and above all, those who live without love. By returning, you may ensure that fewer souls are maimed, fewer families are torn apart. If that seems to you a worthy goal, they we saw good-bye for the present.\" Harry nodded and sighed. Leaving this place would not be nearly as hard as walking into the forest had been, but it was warm and light and peaceful here, and he knew that he was heading back to pain and the fear of more loss. He stood up, and Dumbledore did the same, and they looked for a long moment into each other’s faces. \"Tell me one last thing,\" said Harry, \"Is this real? Or has this been happening inside my head?\" Dumbledore beamed at him, and his voice sounded loud and strong in Harry’s ears even though the bright mist was descending again, obscuring his figure. \"Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean it is not real?\" \n",

            ": Horcruxes Harry could feel the Felix Felicis wearing off as he creeped back into the castle. The front door had remained un locked for him, but on the third floor he met Peeves and only narrowly avoided detection by diving sideways through one of his shortcuts. By the time he got up to the portrait of the Fat Lady and pulled off his Invisibility Cloak, he was not surprised to find her in a most unhelpful mood. \"What sort of time do you call this?\" \"I'm really sorry -- I had to go out for something important --\" \"Well, the password changed at midnight, so you'll just have to sleep in the corridor, won't you?\" \"You're joking!\" said Harry. \"Why did it have to change at midnight?\" \"That's the way it is,\" said the Fat Lady. \"If you're angry, go and take it up with the headmaster, he's the one who's tightened security.\" \"Fantastic,\" said Harry bitterly, looking around at the hard floor. \"Really brilliant. Yeah, I would go and take it up with Dumbledore if he was here, because he's the one who wanted me to --\" \"He is here,\" said a voice behind Harry. \"Professor Dumbledore returned to the school an hour ago.\" Nearly Headless Nick was gliding toward Harry, his head wob-bling as usual upon his ruff. \"I had it from the Bloody Baron, who saw him arrive,\" said Nick. \"He appeared, according to the Baron, to be in good spirits, though a little tired, of course.\" \"Where is he?\" said Harry, his heart leaping,\" \"Oh, groaning and clanking up on the Astronomy Tower, it's a, favorite pastime of his --\" \"Not the Bloody Baron -- Dumbledore!\" \"Oh -- in his office,\" said Nick. \"I believe, from what the Baron said, that he had business to attend to before turning in --\" \"Yeah, he has,\" said Harry, excitement blazing in his chest at the prospect of telling Dumbledore he had secured the memory. He wheeled about and sprinted off again, ignoring the Fat Lady who was calling after him. \"Come back! All right, I lied! I was annoyed you woke me up! The password's still 'tapeworm'!\" But Harry was already hurtling back along the corridor and within minutes, he was saying \"toffee eclairs\" to Dumbledore's gar-goyle, which leapt aside, permitting Harry entrance onto the spiral staircase. \"Enter,\" said Dumbledore when Harry knocked. He sounded exhausted. Harry pushed open the door. There was Dumbledore's office, looking the same as ever, but with black, star-strewn skies beyond the windows. \"Good gracious, Harry,\" said Dumbledore in surprise. \"To what do I owe this very late pleasure?\" \"Sir -- I've got it. I’ve got the memory from Slughorn.\" Harry pulled out the tiny glass bottle and showed it to Dumbledore. For a moment or two, the headmaster looked stunned. Then his face split in a wide smile. \"Harry, this is spectacular news! Very well done indeed! I knew you could do it!\" All thought of the lateness of the hour apparently forgotten, he hurried around his desk, took the bottle with Slughorn's memory in his uninjured hand, and strode over to the cabinet where he kepi the Pensieve. \"And now,\" said Dumbledore, placing the stone basin upon the desk and emptying the contents of the bottle into it. \"Now, at last. we shall see. Harry, quickly . . .\" Harry bowed obediently over the Pensieve and felt his feet leave the office floor. . . . Once again he fell through darkness and landed in Horace Slughorn's office many years before. There was the much younger Slughorn, with his thick, shiny, straw-colored hair and his gingery-blond mustache, sitting again in the comfortable winged armchair in his office, his feet resting upon a velvet pouffe, a small glass of wine in one hand, the other rummaging in a box of crystallized pineapple. And there were the half dozen teenage boys sitting around Slughorn with Tom Riddle in the midst of them, Marvolo's gold-and-black ring gleaming on his finger. Dumbledore landed beside Harry just as Riddle asked, \"Sir is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?\" \"Tom, Tom, if I knew I couldn't tell you,\" said Slughorn, wag-ging his finger reprovingly at Riddle, though winking at the same time. \"I must say, I'd like to know where you get your information, boy, more knowledgeable than half the staff, you are.\" Riddle smiled; the other boys laughed and cast him admiring looks. \"What with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldn't, and your careful flattery of the people who matter -- thank you for the pineapple, by the way, you're quite right, it is my favorite --\" Several of the boys tittered again. \"-- I confidently expect you to rise to Minister of Magic within twenty years. Fifteen, if you keep sending me pineapple, I have ex-cellent contacts at the Ministry.\" Tom Riddle merely smiled as the others laughed again. Harry noticed that he was by no means the eldest of the group of boys, but that they all seemed to look to him as their leader. \"I don't know that politics would suit me, sir,\" he said when the laughter had died away. \"I don't have the right kind of background, for one thing.\" A couple of the boys around him smirked at each other. Harry was sure they were enjoying a private joke, undoubtedly about what they knew, or suspected, regarding their gang leader's famous ancestor. \"Nonsense,\" said Slughorn briskly, \"couldn't be plainer you come from decent Wizarding stock, abilities like yours. No, you'll go far, Tom, I've never been wrong about a student yet.\" The small golden clock standing upon Slughorn's desk chimed eleven o'clock behind him and he looked around. \"Good gracious, is it that time already? You'd better get going boys, or we'll all be in trouble. Lestrange, I want your essay by in morrow or it's detention. Same goes for you, Avery.\" One by one, the boys filed out of the room. Slughorn heaved himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk. A movement behind him made him look around; Riddle was still standing there. \"Look shar p, Tom, you don't want to be caught out of bed out of hours, and you a prefect.. .\" \"Sir, I wanted to ask you something.\" -' \"Ask away, then, m'boy, ask away. . . .\" \"Sir, I wondered what you know about. . . about Horcruxes?' Slughorn stared at him, his thick ringers absentmindedly clawing the stem of his wine glass. \"Project for Defense Against the Dark Arts, is it?\" But Harry could tell that Slughorn knew perfectly well that this was not schoolwork. \"Not exactly, sir,\" said Riddle. \"I came across the term while reading and I didn't fully understand it.\" \"No . . . well. . . you'd be hard-pushed to find a book at Hogwarts that'll give you details on Horcruxes, Tom, that's very Dark stuff, very Dark indeed,\" said Slughorn. \"But you obviously know all about them, sir? I mean, a wizard like you -- sorry, I mean, if you can't tell me, obviously -- I just knew if anyone could tell me, you could -- so I just thought I'd –\" It was very well done, thought Harry, the hesitancy, the casual tone, the careful flattery, none of it overdone. He, Harry, had had too much experience of trying to wheedle information out of re-luctant people not to recognize a master at work. He could tell that Riddle wanted the information very, very much; perhaps had been working toward this moment for weeks. \"Well,\" said Slughorn, not looking at Riddle, but fiddling with the ribbon on top of his box of crystallized pineapple, \"well, it can't hurt to give you an overview, of course. Just so that you understand t he term. A Horcrux is the word used for an object in which a per-son has concealed part of their soul.\" \"I don't quite understand how that works, though, sir,\" said Riddle. His voice was carefully controlled, but Harry could sense his excitement. \"Well, you split your soul, you see,\" said Slughorn, \"and hide part of it in an object outside the body. Then, even if one's body is attacked or destroyed, one cannot die, for part of the soul remains earthbound and undamaged. But of course, existence in such a form ...\" Slughorn's face crumpled and Harry found himself remember-ing words he had heard nearly two years before: \"I was ripped from my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost. . . but still, I was alive.\" \"... few would want it, Tom, very few. Death would be preferable.\" But Riddle's hunger was now apparent; his expression was greedy, he could no longer hide his longing. \"How do you split your soul?\" \"Well,\" said Slughorn uncomfortably, \"you must understand that the soul is supposed to remain intact and whole. Splitting n it I an act of violation, it is against nature.\" \"But how do you do it?\" \"By an act of evil -- the supreme act of evil. By commiting murder. Killing rips the soul apart. The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would use the damage to his advantage: He would encase the torn portion --\" \"Encase? But how -- ?\" \"There is a spell, do not ask me, I don't know!\" said Slughoin shaking his head like an old elephant bothered by mosquitoes. \" Do I look as though I have tried it -- do I look like a killer?\" \"No, sir, of course not,\" said Riddle quickly. \"I'm sorry ... I didn't mean to offend . . .\" \"Not at all, not at all, not offended,\" said Slughorn gruffly, \"It is natural to feel some curiosity about these things. . . . Wizards of a certain caliber have always been drawn to that aspect of magic. . . .\" \"Yes, sir,\" said Riddle. \"What I don't understand, though -- just out of curiosity -- I mean, would one Horcrux be much use? Can you only split your soul once? Wouldn't it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces, I mean, for instance, isn't seven the most powerfully magical number, wouldn't seven -- ?\" \"Merlin's beard, Tom!\" yelped Slughorn. \"Seven! Isn't it bad enough to think of killing one person? And in any case . . . bad enough to divide the soul . . . but to rip it into seven pieces . . .\" Slughorn looked deeply troubled now: He was gazing at Riddle as though he had never seen him plainly before, and Harry could tell that he was regretting entering into the conversation at all. \"Of course,\" he muttered, \"this is all hypothetical, what we're discussing, isn't it? All academic . . .\" \"Yes, sir, of course,\" said Riddle quickly. \"But all the same, Tom . . . keep it quiet, what I've told -- that's to say, what we've discussed. People wouldn't like to think we've been chatting about Horcruxes. It's a banned subject at Hogwarts, you know. . . . Dumbledore's particularly fierce about it. ...\" \"I won't say a word, sir,\" said Riddle, and he left, but not before Harry had glimpsed his face, which was full of that same wild hap-piness it had worn when he had first found out that he was a wiz-ard, the sort of happiness that did not enhance his handsome features, but made them, somehow, less human. . . . \"Thank you, Harry,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"Let us go. . . .\" When Harry landed back on the office floor Dumbledore was ; already sitting down behind his desk. Harry sat too and waited for Dumbledore to speak. \"I have been hoping for this piece of evidence for a very long time,\" said Dumbledore at last. \"It confirms the theory on which I have been working, it tells me that I am right, and also how very far there is still to go. ...\" Harry suddenly noticed that every single one of the old head-masters and headmistresses in the portraits around the walls was awake and listening in on their conversation. A corpulent, red nosed wizard had actually taken out an ear trumpet. \"Well, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, \"I am sure you understood the significance of what we just heard. At the same age as you are now, give or take a few months, Tom Riddle was doing all he could to find out how to make himself immortal.\" \"You think he succeeded then, sir?\" asked Harry. \"He made a Horcrux? And that's why he didn't die when he attacked me? He had a Horcrux hidden somewhere? A bit of his soul was safe?\" \"A bit... or more,\" said Dumbledore. \"You heard Voldemort, what he particularly wanted from Horace was an opinion on what would happen to the wizard who created more than one Horcrux, what would happen to the wizard so determined to evade death that he would be prepared to murder many times, rip his soul repeatedly, so as to store it in many, separately concealed Horcruxc. No book would have given him that information. As far as I know -- as far, I am sure, as Voldemort knew -- no wizard had ever done more than tear his soul in two.\" Dumbledore paused for a moment, marshaling his thought, and then said, \"Four years ago, I received what I considered certain proof that Voldemort had split his soul.\" \"Where?\" asked Harry. \"How?\" \"You handed it to me, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. \"The diary, Riddles diary, the one giving instructions on how to reopen the Chamber of Secrets.\" \"I don't understand, sir,\" said Harry. \"Well, although I did not see the Riddle who came out of the di-ary, what you described to me was a phenomenon I had never wit-nessed. A mere memory starting to act and think for itself? A mere memory, sapping the life out of the girl into whose hands it had fallen? No, something much more sinister had lived inside that book. ... a fragment of soul, I was almost sure of it. The diary had been a Horcrux. But this raised as many questions as it answered. What intrigued and alarmed me most was that that diary had been intended as a weapon as much as a safeguard.\" \"1 still don't understand,\" said Harry. \"Well, it worked as a Horcrux is supposed to work -- in other words, the fragment of soul concealed inside it was kept safe and had undoubtedly played its part in preventing the death of its owner. But there could be no doubt that Riddle really wanted that diary read, wanted the piece of his soul to inhabit or possess some-body else, so that Slytherin's monster would be unleashed again.\" \"Well, he didn't want his hard work to be wasted,\" said Harry. \"He wanted people to know he was Slytherin's heir, because he couldn't take credit at the time.\" \"Quite correct,\" said Dumbledore, nodding. \"But don't you see, Harry, that if he intended the diary to be passed to, or planted on, some future Hogwarts student, he was being remarkably blase about that precious fragment of his soul concealed within it. The point of a Horcrux is, as Professor Slughorn explained, to keep part of the self hidden and safe, not to fling it into somebody else's path and run the risk that they might destroy it -- as indeed happened: That particular fragment of soul is no more; you saw to that. The careless way in which Voldemort regarded this Horcrux seemed most ominous to me. It suggested that he must have made -- or had been planning to make -- more Horcruxes, so that the loss of his first would not be so detrimental. I did not wish to be-lieve it, but nothing else seemed to make sense. Then you told me, two years later, that on the night that Volde-mort returned to his body, he made a most illuminating and alarm-ing statement to his Death Eaters. ‘I who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality.’ That was what you told me he said. 'Further than anybody!' And I thought I knew what that meant, though the Death Eaters did not. He was referring to his Horcruxes, Horcruxes in the plural, Harry, which I don’t believe any other wizard has ever had. Yet it fitted: Lord Voldomort has seemed to grow less human with the passing years, and the transformation he had undergone seemed to me to be only explainable if his soul was mutilated beyond the realms of what we might call 'usual evil' . . .\" \"So he's made himself impossible to kill by murdering other people?\" said Harry. \"Why couldn't he make a Sorcerer's Stone, or steal one, if he was so interested in immortality?\" \"Well, we know that he tried to do just that, five years ago,\" s;n«l Dumbledore. \"But there are several reasons why, I think, a Sorcerer's Stone would appeal less than Horcruxes to Lord Voldemort, \"While the Elixir of Life does indeed extend life, it must lie drunk regularly, for all eternity, if the drinker is to maintain the immortality. Therefore, Voldemort would be entirely dependant on the Elixir, and if it ran out, or was contaminated, or if the Stone was stolen, he would die just like any other man. Voldemort likes to operate alone, remember. I believe that he would have found the thought of being dependent, even on the Elixir, intolerable. Of course he was prepared to drink it if it would take him out of the horrible part-life to which he was condemned after attacking you, but only to regain a body. Thereafter, I am convinced, he intended to continue to rely on his Horcruxes. He would need nothing more, if only he could regain a human form. He was already im-mortal, you see ... or as close to immortal as any man can be. But now, Harry, armed with this information, the crucial memory you have succeeded in procuring for us, we are closer to the se-cret of finishing Lord Voldemort than anyone has ever been before. You heard him, Harry: 'Wouldn't it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces . . . isn't seven the most powerfully magical number . . .' Isn't seven the most powerfully magical number. Yes, I think the idea of a seven-part soul would greatly appeal to Lord Voldemort.\" \"He made seven Horcruxes?\" said Harry, horror-struck, while several of the portraits on the walls made similar noises of shock mid outrage. \"But they could be anywhere in the world -- hidden -- buried or invisible --\" \"I am glad to see you appreciate the magnitude of the problem,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"But firstly, no, Harry, not seven Hor-cruxes: six. The seventh part of his soul, however maimed, resides inside his regenerated body. That was the part of him that lived a spectral existence for so many years during his exile; without that, he has no self at all. That seventh piece of soul will be the last that anybody wishing to kill Voldemort must attack -- the piece that lives in his body.\" \"But the six Horcruxes, then,\" said Harry, a little desperately, \"how are we supposed to find them?\" \"You are forgetting . . . you have already destroyed one of them. And I have destroyed another.\" \"You have?\" said Harry eagerly. \"Yes indeed,\" said Dumbledore, and he raised his blackened, burned-looking hand. \"The ring, Harry. Marvolo's ring. And a ter-rible curse there was upon it too. Had it not been -- forgive me the lack of seemly modesty -- for my own prodigious skill, and for Professor Snape's timely action when I returned to Hogwarts, des-perately injured, I might not have lived to tell the tale. However, a withered hand does not seem an unreasonable exchange for a sev-enth of Voldemort's soul. The ring is no longer a Horcrux.\" \"But how did you find it?\" \"Well, as you now know, for many years I have made it my business to discover as much as I can about Voldemort's past life. I have traveled widely, visiting those places he once knew. I stumbled across the ring hidden in the ruin of the Gaunt’s house. It seem that once Voldemort had succeeded in sealing a piece of his soul in side it, he did not want to wear it anymore. He hid it, protected by many powerful enchantments, in the shack where his ancestors had once lived (Morfin having been carted off to Azkaban, of course), never guessing that I might one day take the trouble to visit the ruin, or that I might be keeping an eye open for traces of magical concealment. \"However, we should not congratulate ourselves too heartily. You destroyed the diary and I the ring, but if we are right in our theory of a seven-part soul, four Horcruxes remain.\" \"And they could be anything?\" said Harry. \"They could be oh, in tin cans or, I dunno, empty potion bottles. . . .\" \"You are thinking of Portkeys, Harry, which must be ordinary objects, easy to overlook. But would Lord Voldemort use tin cans or old potion bottles to guard his own precious soul? You are forgetting what I have showed you. Lord Voldemort liked to collect trophies, and he preferred objects with a powerful magical history His pride, his belief in his own superiority, his determination to carve for himself a startling place in magical history; these things, suggest to me that Voldemort would have chosen his Horcruxr with some care, favoring objects worthy of the honor.\" \"The diary wasn't that special.\" \"The diary, as you have said yourself, was proof that he was the Hire of Slytherin. I am sure that Voldemort considered it of stu-pendous importance.\" \"So, the other Horcruxes?\" said Harry. \"Do you think you know what they are, sir?\" \"I can only guess,\" said Dumbledore. \"For the reasons I have al-ready given, I believe that Lord Voldemort would prefer objects that, in themselves, have a certain grandeur. I have therefore trawled back through Voldemort's past to see if I can find evidence that such artifacts have disappeared around him.\" \"The locket!\" said Harry loudly, \"Hufflepuff's cup!\" \"Yes,\" said Dumbledore, smiling, \"I would be prepared to bet -- perhaps not my other hand -- but a couple of fingers, that they be-came Horcruxes three and four. The remaining two, assuming again that he created a total of six, are more of a problem, but I will hazard a guess that, having secured objects from Hufflepuff and Slytherin, he set out to track down objects owned by Gryffindor or Ravenclaw. Four objects from the four founders would, I am sure, have exerted a powerful pull over Voldemort's imagination. I can-not answer for whether he ever managed to find anything of Ravenclaw's. I am confident, however, that the only known relic of Gryffindor remains safe.\" Dumbledore pointed his blackened fingers to the wall behind him, where a ruby-encrusted sword reposed within a glass case. \"Do you think that's why he really wanted to come back to Hogwarts, sir?\" said Harry. \"To try and find something from one of the other founders?\" \"My thoughts precisely,\" said Dumbledore. \"But unfortunately, that does not advance us much further, for he was turned away, or so I believe, without the chance to search the school. I am forced to conclude that he never fulfilled his ambition of collecting four founders' objects. He definitely had two -- he may have found three -- that is the best we can do for now.\" \"Even if he got something of Ravenclaw's or of Gryffindor's, that leaves a sixth Horcrux,\" said Harry, counting on his fingers. \"Unless he’s got both?\" \"I don't think so,\" said Dumbledore. \"I think I know what the sixth Horcrux is. I wonder what you will say when I confess that I have been curious for a while about the behavior of the snake, Nagini?' \"The snake?\" said Harry, startled. \"You can use animals as Horcruxes?\" \"Well, it is inadvisable to do so,\" said Dumbledore, \"because to confide a part of your soul to something that can think and move for itself is obviously a very risky business. However, if my calculations are correct, Voldemort was still at least one Horcrux short of his goal of six when he entered your parents' house with the inten-tion of killing you. He seems to have reserved the process of making Horcruxes for particularly significant deaths. You would certainly have been that. He believed that in killing you, he was destroying the danger the prophecy had outlined. He believed he was making himself invin-cible. I am sure that he was intending to make his final Horcrux with your death. As we know, he failed. After an interval of some years, however, he used Nagini to kill an old Muggle man, and it might then have occurred to him to turn her into his last Horcrux. She underlines the Slytherin connection, which enhances Lord Voldemorts mys-tique; I think he is perhaps as fond of her as he can be of anything; he certainly likes to keep her close, and he seems to have an un-usual amount of control over her, even for a Parselmouth.\" \"So,\" said Harry, \"the diary's gone, the ring's gone. The cup, the locket, and the snake are still intact, and you think there might be a Horcrux that was once Ravenclaw's or Gryffindor's?\" \"An admirably succinct and accurate summary, yes,\" said Dum-bledore, bowing his head. \"So . . . are you still looking for them, sir? Is that where you've been going when you've been leaving the school?\" \"Correct,\" said Dumbledore. \"I have been looking for a very long time. I think. . . perhaps ... I may be close to finding an-other one. There are hopeful signs.\" \"And if you do,\" said Harry quickly, \"can I come with you and help get rid of it?\" Dumbledore looked at Harry very intently for a moment before saying, \"Yes, I think so.\" \"I can?\" said Harry, thoroughly taken aback. \"Oh yes,\" said Dumbledore, smiling slightly. \"I think you have earned that right.\" Harry felt his heart lift. It was very good not to hear words of caution and protection for once. The headmasters and head-mistresses around the walls seemed less impressed by Dumbledore's decision; Harry saw a few of them shaking their heads and Phineas Nigellus actually snorted. \"Does Voldemort know when a Horcrux is destroyed, sir? Can he feel it?\" Harry asked, ignoring the portraits. \"A very interesting question, Harry. I believe not. I believe that Voldemort is now so immersed in evil, and these crucial parts of himself have been detached for so long, he does not feel as we do. Perhaps, at the point of death, he might be aware of his loss . . . but he was not aware, for instance, that the diary had been destroyed until he forced the truth out of Lucius Malfoy. When Voldemort discovered that the diary had been mutilated and robbed of all its powers, I am told that his anger was terrible to behold.\" \"But I thought he meant Lucius Malfoy to smuggle it into Hogwarts?\" \"Yes, he did, years ago, when he was sure he would be able to create more Horcruxes, but still Lucius was supposed to wait for Voldemorts say-so, and he never received it, for Voldemort van-ished shortly after giving him the diary. No doubt he thought that Lucius would not dare do anything with the Horcrux other than guard it carefully, but he was counting too much upon Lucius’s fear of a master who had been gone for years and whom Lucius believed dead. Of course, Lucius did not know what the diary really was. I understand that Voldemort had told him the diary would cause the Chamber of Secrets to reopen because it was cleverly enchanted. Had Lucius known he held a portion of his mas-ters soul in his hands, he would undoubtedly have treated it with more reverence -- but instead he went ahead and carried out the old plan for his own ends. By planting the diary upon Arthur Weasleys daughter, he hoped to discredit Arthur and get rid of a highly incrim-inating magical object in one stroke. Ah, poor Lucius . . . what with Voldemorts fury about the fact that he threw away the Horcrux for his own gain, and the fiasco at the Ministry last year, I would not be sur-prised if he is not secretly glad to be safe in Azkaban at the moment.\" Harry sat in thought for a moment, then asked, \"So if all of his Horcruxes are destroyed, Voldemort couldbe killed?\" \"Yes, I think so,\" said Dumbledore. \"Without his Horcruxes, Voldemort will be a mortal man with a maimed and diminished soul. Never forget, though, that while his soul may be damaged be-yond repair, his brain and his magical powers remain intact. It will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like Voldemort even without his Horcruxes.\" \"But I haven't got uncommon skill and power,\" said Harry, be-fore he could stop himself. \"Yes, you have,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"You have a power that Voldemort has never had. You can --\" \"I know!\" said Harry impatiently. \"I can love!\" It was only with difficulty that he stopped himself adding, \"Big deal!\" \"Yes, Harry, you can love,\" said Dumbledore, who looked as though he knew perfectly well what Harry had just refrained from saying. \"Which, given everything that has happened to you, is a great and remarkable thing. You are still too young to understand how unusual you are, Harry.\" \"So, when the prophecy says that I'll have 'power the Dark Lord knows not,' it just means -- love?\" asked Harry, feeling a little let down. \"Yes -- just love,\" said Dumbledore. \"But Harry, never forget that what the prophecy says is only significant because Voldemort made it so. I told you this at the end of last year. Voldemort singled you out as the person who would be most dangerous to him -- and in doing so, he made you the person who would be most dan-gerous to him!\" \"But it comes to the same --\" \"No, it doesn't!\" said Dumbledore, sounding impatient now. Pointing at Harry with his black, withered hand, he said, \"You are setting too much store by the prophecy!\" \"But,\" spluttered Harry, \"but you said the prophecy means --\" \"If Voldemort had never heard of the prophecy, would it have been fulfilled? Would it have meant anything? Of course not! Ho you think every prophecy in the Hall of Prophecy has been fulfilled?\" \"But,\" said Harry, bewildered, \"but last year, you said one of us would have to kill the other --\" \"Harry, Harry, only because Voldemort made a grave error, and acted on Professor Trelawney's words! If Voldemort had never murdered your father, would he have imparted in you a furious desire for revenge? Of course not! If he had not forced your mother to die for you, would he have given you a magical protection he could not penetrate? Of course not, Harry! Don't you see? Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back! Voldemort is no different! Always he was on the lookout for the one who would challenge him. He heard the prophecy and he leapt into ac-tion, with the result that he not only handpicked the man most likely to finish him, he handed him uniquely deadly weapons!\" \"But --\" \"It is essential that you understand this!\" said Dumbledore, standing up and striding about the room, his glittering robes swooshing in his wake; Harry had never seen him so agitated. \"By attempting to kill you, Voldemort himself singled out the remark-able person who sits here in front of me, and gave him the tools for the job! It is Voldemort's fault that you were able to see into his thoughts, his ambitions, that you even understand the snakelike language in which he gives orders, and yet, Harry, despite your privileged insight into Voldemort's world (which, incidentally, is a gift any Death Eater would kill to have), you have never been se-duced by the Dark Arts, never, even for a second, shown the slight-est desire to become one of Voldemort's followers!\" \"Of course I haven't!\" said Harry indignantly. \"He killed my mum and dad!\" \"You are protected, in short, by your ability to love!\" said Dum-bledore loudly. \"The only protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like Voldemort's! In spite of all the temptation you have endured, all the suffering, you remain pure of heart, just as pure as you were at the age of eleven, when you stared into a mir-ror that reflected your heart's desire, and it showed you only the way to thwart Lord Voldemort, and not immortality or riches. Harry, have you any idea how few wizards could have seen what you saw in that mirror? Voldemort should have known then what he was dealing with, but he did not! But he knows it now. You have flitted into Lord Voldemort's mind without damage to yourself, but he cannot possess you with-out enduring mortal agony, as he discovered in the Ministry. I do not think he understands why, Harry, but then, he was in such a hurry to mutilate his own soul, he never paused to understand the incomparable power of a soul that is untarnished and whole.\" \"But, sir,\" said Harry, making valiant efforts not to sound argu-mentative, \"it all comes to the same thing, doesn't it? I've got to try and kill him, or --\" \"Got to?\" said Dumbledore. \"Of course you've got to! But not because of the prophecy! Because you, yourself, will never rest until you've tried! We both know it! Imagine, please, just for a moment, that you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think!\" Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front ol him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father, and Sinus. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat. \"I'd want him finished,\" said Harry quietly. \"And I'd want to do it.\" \"Of course you would!\" cried Dumbledore. \"You see, the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal. ... In other words, you are free to choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! But Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy. He will continue to hunt you . . . which makes it certain, really, that --\" \"That one of us is going to end up killing the other,\" said Harry. \"Yes.\" But he understood at last what Dumbledore had been trying to tell him. It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumble-dore knew -- and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents -- that there was all the difference in the world. \n",

            " THIRTYFIVE  VERITASERUM Harry felt himself slam flat into the ground; his face was pressed into grass; the smell of it filled his nostrils. He had closed his eyes while the Portkey transported him, and he kept them closed now. He did not move. All the breath seemed to have been knocked out of him; his head was swimming so badly he felt as though the ground beneath him were swaying like the deck of a ship. To hold himself steady, he tightened his hold on the two things he was still clutching: the smooth, cold handle of the Triwizard Cup and Cedric's body. He felt as though he would slide away into the blackness gathering at the edges of his brain if he let go of either of them. Shock and exhaustion kept him on the ground, breathing in the smell of the grass, waiting . . . waiting for someone to do something . . . something to happen . . . and all the while, his scar burned dully on his forehead. . . . A torrent of sound deafened and confused him; there were voices everywhere, footsteps, screams. ... He remained where he was, his face screwed up against the noise, as though it were a nightmare that would pass. . . . Then a pair of hands seized him roughly and turned him over. \"Harry! Harry!\" He opened his eyes. He was looking up at the starry sky, and Albus Dumbledore was crouched over him. The dark shadows of a crowd of people pressed in around them, pushing nearer; Harry felt the ground beneath his head reverberating with their footsteps. He had come back to the edge of the maze. He could see the stands rising above him, the shapes of people moving in them, the stars above. Harry let go of the cup, but he clutched Cedric to him even more tightly. He raised his free hand and seized Dumbledore's wrist, while Dumbledore's face swam in and out of focus. \"He's back,\" Harry whispered. \"He's back. Voldemort.\" \"What's going on? What's happened?\" The face of Cornelius Fudge appeared upside down over Harry; it looked white, appalled. \"My God  Diggory!\" it whispered. \"Dumbledore  he's dead!\" The words were repeated, the shadowy figures pressing in on them gasped it to those around them . . . and then others shouted it  screeched it  into the night  \"He's dead!\" \"He's dead!\" \"Cedric Diggory! Dead!\" \"Harry, let go of him,\" he heard Fudge's voice say, and he felt fingers trying to pry him from Cedric's limp body, but Harry wouldn't let him go. Then Dumbledore's face, which was still blurred and misted, came closer. \"Harry, you can't help him now. It's over. Let go.\" \"He wanted me to bring him back,\" Harry muttered  it seemed important to explain this. \"He wanted me to bring him back to his parents. ...\" \"That's right. Harry . . . just let go now. . . .\" Dumbledore bent down, and with extraordinary strength for a man so old and thin, raised Harry from the ground and set him on his feet. Harry swayed. His head was pounding. His injured leg would no longer support his weight. The crowd around them jostled, fighting to get closer, pressing darkly in on him  \"What's happened?\" \"What's wrong with him?\" \"Diggorys dead!\" \"He'll need to go to the hospital wing!\" Fudge was saying loudly. \"He's ill, he's injured  Dumbledore, Diggory's parents, they're here, they're in the stands. ...\" \"I'll take Harry, Dumbledore, I'll take him \" \"No, I would prefer\" \"Dumbledore, Amos Diggorys running . . . he's coming over. . . . Don't you think you should tell him  before he sees  ?\" \"Harry, stay here \" Girls were screaming, sobbing hysterically.... The scene flickered oddly before Harry's eyes. . . . \"Its all right, son, I've got you . . . come on ... hospital wing . . .\" \"Dumbledore said stay,\" said Harry thickly, the pounding in his scar making him feel as though he was about to throw up; his vision was blurring worse than ever. \"You need to lie down. . .. Come on now....\" Someone larger and stronger than he was was half pulling, half carrying him through the frightened crowd. Harry heard people gasping, screaming, and shouting as the man supporting him pushed a path through them, taking him back to the castle. Across the lawn, past the lake and the Durmstrang ship, Harry heard nothing but the heavy breathing of the man helping him walk. \"What happened. Harry?\" the man asked at last as he lifted Harry up the stone steps. Clunk. Clunk. Clunk. It was MadEye Moody. \"Cup was a Portkey,\" said Harry as they crossed the entrance hall. \"Took me and Cedric to a graveyard . . . and Voldemort was there . . . Lord Voldemort...\" Clunk. Clunk. Clunk. Up the marble stairs . . . \"The Dark Lord was there? What happened then?\" \"Killed Cedric . . . they killed Cedric. . . .\" \"And then?\" Clunk. Clunk. Clunk. Along the corridor . . . \"Made a potion . . . got his body back. . . .\" \"The Dark Lord got his body back? He's returned?\" \"And the Death Eaters came . . . and then we dueled. ...\" \"You dueled with the Dark Lord?\" \"Got away . . . my wand . . . did something funny. ... I saw my mum and dad . . . they came out of his wand. ...\" \"In here. Harry ... in here, and sit down. . . . You'll be all right now . . . drink this. ...\" Harry heard a key scrape in a lock and felt a cup being pushed into his hands. \"Drink it... you'll feel better . . . come on, now. Harry, I need to know exactly what happened. ...\" Moody helped tip the stuff down Harrys throat; he coughed, a peppery taste burning his throat. Moody's office came into sharper focus, and so did Moody himself. ... He looked as white as Fudge had looked, and both eyes were fixed unblinkingly upon Harry's face. \"Voldemort's back, Harry? You're sure he's back? How did he do it?\" \"He took stuff from his father's grave, and from Wormtail, and me,\" said Harry. His head felt clearer; his scar wasn't hurting so badly; he could now see Moodys face distinctly, even though the office was dark. He could still hear screaming and shouting from the distant Quidditch field. \"What did the Dark Lord take from you?\" said Moody. \"Blood,\" said Harry, raising his arm. His sleeve was ripped where Wormtail's dagger had torn it. Moody let out his breath in a long, low hiss. \"And the Death Eaters? They returned?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry. \"Loads of them . . .\" \"How did he treat them?\" Moody asked quietly. \"Did he forgive them?\" But Harry had suddenly remembered. He should have told Dumbledore, he should have said it straightaway  \"There's a Death Eater at Hogwarts! There's a Death Eater here  they put my name in the Goblet of Fire, they made sure I got through to the end \" Harry tried to get up, but Moody pushed him back down. \"I know who the Death Eater is,\" he said quietly. \"Karkaroff?\" said Harry wildly. \"Where is he? Have you got him? Is he locked up?\" \"Karkaroff?\" said Moody with an odd laugh. \"Karkaroff fled tonight, when he felt the Dark Mark burn upon his arm. He betrayed too many faithful supporters of the Dark Lord to wish to meet them . . . but I doubt he will get far. The Dark Lord has ways of tracking his enemies.\" \"Karkaroff's gone? He ran away? But then  he didn't put my name in the goblet?\" \"No,\" said Moody slowly. \"No, he didn't. It was I who did that.\" Harry heard, but didn't believe. \"No, you didn't,\" he said. \"You didn't do that. . . you can't have done...\" \"I assure you I did,\" said Moody, and his magical eye swung around and fixed upon the door, and Harry knew he was making sure that there was no one outside it. At the same time, Moody drew out his wand and pointed it at Harry. \"He forgave them, then?\" he said. \"The Death Eaters who went free? The ones who escaped Azkaban?\" \"What?\" said Harry. He was looking at the wand Moody was pointing at him. This was a bad joke, it had to be. \"I asked you,\" said Moody quietly, \"whether he forgave the scum who never even went to look for him. Those treacherous cowards who wouldn't even brave Azkaban for him. The faithless, worthless bits of filth who were brave enough to cavort in masks at the Quidditch World Cup, but fled at the sight of the Dark Mark when I fired it into the sky.\" \"You fired . . . What are you talking about. . . ?\" \"I told you. Harry ... I told you. If there's one thing I hate more than any other, it's a Death Eater who walked free. They turned their backs on my master when he needed them most. I expected him to punish them. I expected him to torture them. Tell me he hurt them, Harry. . . .\" Moody's face was suddenly lit with an insane smile. \"Tell me he told them that I, I alone remained faithful... prepared to risk everything to deliver to him the one thing he wanted above all... you\" \"You didn't... it  it can't be you. ...\" \"Who put your name in the Goblet of Fire, under the name of a different school? I did. Who frightened off every person I thought might try to hurt you or prevent you from winning the tournament? I did. Who nudged Hagrid into showing you the dragons? I did. Who helped you see the only way you could beat the dragon? I did\" Moody's magical eye had now left the door. It was fixed upon Harry. His lopsided mouth leered more widely than ever. \"It hasn't been easy, Harry, guiding you through these tasks without arousing suspicion. I have had to use every ounce of cunning I possess, so that my hand would not be detectable in your success. Dumbledore would have been very suspicious if you had managed everything too easily. As long as you got into that maze, preferably with a decent head start  then, I knew, I would have a chance of getting rid of the other champions and leaving your way clear. But I also had to contend with your stupidity. The second task . . . that was when I was most afraid we would fail. I was keeping watch on you, Potter. I knew you hadn't worked out the egg's clue, so I had to give you another hint \" \"You didn't,\" Harry said hoarsely. \"Cedric gave me the clue \" \"Who told Cedric to open it underwater? I did. I trusted that he would pass the information on to you. Decent people are so easy to manipulate, Potter. I was sure Cedric would want to repay you for telling him about the dragons, and so he did. But even then, Potter, even then you seemed likely to fail. I was watching all the time ... all those hours in the library. Didn't you realize that the book you needed was in your dormitory all along? I planted it there early on, I gave it to the Longbottom boy, don't you remember? Magical Water Plants of the Mediterranean. It would have told you all you needed to know about gillyweed. I expected you to ask everyone and anyone you could for help. Longbottom would have told you in an instant. But you did not. . . you did not. . . . You have a streak of pride and independence that might have ruined all. \"So what could I do? Feed you information from another innocent source. You told me at the Yule Ball a houseelf called Dobby had given you a Christmas present. I called the elf to the staffroom to collect some robes for cleaning. I staged a loud conversation with Professor McGonagall about the hostages who had been taken, and whether Potter would think to use gillyweed. And your little elf friend ran straight to Snape's office and then hurried to find you...\" Moodys wand was still pointing directly at Harry's heart. Over his shoulder, foggy shapes were moving in the FoeGlass on the wall. \"You were so long in that lake, Potter, I thought you had drowned. But luckily, Dumbledore took your idiocy for nobility, and marked you high for it. I breathed again. \"You had an easier time of it than you should have in that maze tonight, of course,\" said Moody. \"I was patrolling around it, able to see through the outer hedges, able to curse many obstacles out of your way. I Stunned Fleur Delacour as she passed. I put the Imperius Curse on Krum, so that he would finish Diggory and leave your path to the cup clear.\" Harry stared at Moody. He just didn't see how this could be. ... Dumbledore's friend, the famous Auror. . . the one who had caught so many Death Eaters ... It made no sense ... no sense at all. ... The foggy shapes in the FoeGlass were sharpening, had become more distinct. Harry could see the outlines of three people over Moody's shoulder, moving closer and closer. But Moody wasn't watching them. His magical eye was upon Harry. \"The Dark Lord didn't manage to kill you. Potter, and he so wanted to,\" whispered Moody. \"Imagine how he will reward me when he finds I have done it for him. I gave you to him  the thing he needed above all to regenerate  and then I killed you for him. I will be honored beyond all other Death Eaters. I will be his dearest, his closest supporter . . . closer than a son. ...\" Moody's normal eye was bulging, the magical eye fixed upon Harry. The door was barred, and Harry knew he would never reach his own wand in time. . . . \"The Dark Lord and I,\" said Moody, and he looked completely insane now, towering over Harry, leering down at him, \"have much in common. Both of us, for instance, had very disappointing fathers . . . very disappointing indeed. Both of us suffered the indignity, Harry, of being named after those fathers. And both of us had the pleasure . . . the very great pleasure ... of killing our fathers to ensure the continued rise of the Dark Order!\" \"You're mad,\" Harry said  he couldn't stop himself \"you're mad!\" \"Mad, am I?\" said Moody, his voice rising uncontrollably. \"We'll see! We'll see who's mad, now that the Dark Lord has returned, with me at his side! He is back, Harry Potter, you did not conquer him  and now  I conquer you!\" Moody raised his wand, he opened his mouth; Harry plunged his own hand into his robes  \"Stupefy!\" There was a blinding flash of red light, and with a great splintering and crashing, the door of Moody's office was blasted apart  Moody was thrown backward onto the office floor. Harry, still staring at the place where Moody's face had been, saw Albus Dumbledore, Professor Snape, and Professor McGonagall looking back at him out of the FoeGlass. He looked around and saw the three of them standing in the doorway, Dumbledore in front, his wand outstretched. At that moment, Harry fully understood for the first time why people said Dumbledore was the only wizard Voldemort had ever feared. The look upon Dumbledore's face as he stared down at the unconscious form of MadEye Moody was more terrible than Harry could have ever imagined. There was no benign smile upon Dumbledore's face, no twinkle in the eyes behind the spectacles. There was cold fury in every line of the ancient face; a sense of power radiated from Dumbledore as though he were giving off burning heat. He stepped into the office, placed a foot underneath Moodys unconscious body, and kicked him over onto his back, so that his face was visible. Snape followed him, looking into the FoeGlass, where his own face was still visible, glaring into the room. Professor McGonagall went straight to Harry. \"Come along, Potter,\" she whispered. The thin line of her mouth was twitching as though she was about to cry. \"Come along . . . hospital wing ...\" \"No,\" said Dumbledore sharply. \"Dumbledore, he ought to  look at him  he's been through enough tonight \" \"He will stay, Minerva, because he needs to understand,\" said Dumbledore curtly. \"Understanding is the first step to acceptance, and only with acceptance can there be recovery. He needs to know who has put him through the ordeal he has suffered tonight, and why,\" \"Moody,\" Harry said. He was still in a state of complete disbelief. \"How can it have been Moody?\" \"This is not Alastor Moody,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"You have never known Alastor Moody. The real Moody would not have removed you from my sight after what happened tonight. The moment he took you, I knew  and I followed.\" Dumbledore bent down over Moody's limp form and put a hand inside his robes. He pulled out Moody's hip flask and a set of keys on a ring. Then he turned to Professors McGonagall and Snape. \"Severus, please fetch me the strongest Truth Potion you possess, and then go down to the kitchens and bring up the houseelf called Winky. Minerva, kindly go down to Hagrid's house, where you will find a large black dog sitting in the pumpkin patch. Take the dog up to my office, tell him I will be with him shortly, then come back here.\" If either Snape or McGonagall found these instructions peculiar, they hid their confusion. Both turned at once and left the office. Dumbledore walked over to the trunk with seven locks, fitted the first key in the lock, and opened it. It contained a mass of spellbooks. Dumbledore closed the trunk, placed a second key in the second lock, and opened the trunk again. The spellbooks had vanished; this time it contained an assortment of broken Sneakoscopes, some parchment and quills, and what looked like a silvery Invisibility Cloak. Harry watched, astounded, as Dumbledore placed the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth keys in their respective locks, reopening the trunk each time, and revealing different contents each time. Then he placed the seventh key in the lock, threw open the lid, and Harry let out a cry of amazement. He was looking down into a kind of pit, an underground room, and lying on the floor some ten feet below, apparently fast asleep, thin and starved in appearance, was the real MadEye Moody. His wooden leg was gone, the socket that should have held the magical eye looked empty beneath its lid, and chunks of his grizzled hair were missing. Harry stared, thunderstruck, between the sleeping Moody in the trunk and the unconscious Moody lying on the floor of the office. Dumbledore climbed into the trunk, lowered himself, and fell lightly onto the floor beside the sleeping Moody. He bent over him. \"Stunned  controlled by the Imperius Curse  very weak,\" he said. \"Of course, they would have needed to keep him alive. Harry, throw down the imposter's cloak  he's freezing. Madam Pomfrey will need to see him, but he seems in no immediate danger.\" Harry did as he was told; Dumbledore covered Moody in the cloak, tucked it around him, and clambered out of the trunk again. Then he picked up the hip flask that stood upon the desk, unscrewed it, and turned it over. A thick glutinous liquid splattered onto the office floor. \"Polyjuice Potion, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. \"You see the simplicity of it, and the brilliance. For Moody never does drink except from his hip flask, he's well known for it. The imposter needed, of course, to keep the real Moody close by, so that he could continue making the potion. You see his hair ...\" Dumbledore looked down on the Moody in the trunk. \"The imposter has been cutting it off all year, see where it is uneven? But I think, in the excitement of tonight, our fake Moody might have forgotten to take it as frequendy as he should have done ... on the hour . . . every hour. . . . We shall see.\" Dumbledore pulled out the chair at the desk and sat down upon it, his eyes fixed upon the unconscious Moody on the floor. Harry stared at him too. Minutes passed in silence... . Then, before Harry's very eyes, the face of the man on the floor began to change. The scars were disappearing, the skin was becoming smooth; the mangled nose became whole and started to shrink. The long mane of grizzled gray hair was withdrawing into the scalp and turning the color of straw. Suddenly, with a loud clunk, the wooden leg fell away as a normal leg regrew in its place; next moment, the magical eyeball had popped out of the man's face as a real eye replaced it; it rolled away across the floor and continued to swivel in every direction. Harry saw a man lying before him, paleskinned, slightly freckled, with a mop of fair hair. He knew who he was. He had seen him in Dumbledore's Pensieve, had watched him being led away from court by the dementors, trying to convince Mr. Crouch that he was innocent. . . but he was lined around the eyes now and looked much older. . . . There were hurried footsteps outside in the corridor. Snape had returned with Winky at his heels. Professor McGonagall was right behind them. \"Crouch!\" Snape said, stopping dead in the doorway. \"Barty Crouch!\" \"Good heavens,\" said Professor McGonagall, stopping dead and staring down at the man on the floor. Filthy, disheveled, Winky peered around Snape's legs. Her mouth opened wide and she let out a piercing shriek. \"Master Barty, Master Barty, what is you doing here?\" She flung herself forward onto the young man's chest. \"You is killed him! You is killed him! You is killed Master's son!\" \"He is simply Stunned, Winky,\" said Dumbledore. \"Step aside, please. Severus, you have the potion?\" Snape handed Dumbledore a small glass bottle of completely clear liquid: the Veritaserum with which he had threatened Harry in class. Dumbledore got up, bent over the man on the floor, and pulled him into a sitting position against the wall beneath the FoeGlass, in which the reflections of Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall were still glaring down upon them all. Winky remained on her knees, trembling, her hands over her face. Dumbledore forced the mans mouth open and poured three drops inside it. Then he pointed his wand at the mans chest and said, \"Ennervate.\" Crouch's son opened his eyes. His face was slack, his gaze unfocused. Dumbledore knelt before him, so that their faces were level. \"Can you hear me?\" Dumbledore asked quietly. The man's eyelids flickered. \"Yes,\" he muttered. \"I would like you to tell us,\" said Dumbledore softly, \"how you came to be here. How did you escape from Azkaban?\" Crouch took a deep, shuddering breath, then began to speak in a flat, expressionless voice. \"My mother saved me. She knew she was dying. She persuaded my father to rescue me as a last favor to her. He loved her as he had never loved me. He agreed. They came to visit me. They gave me a draft of Polyjuice Potion containing one of my mother's hairs. She took a draft of Polyjuice Potion containing one of my hairs. We took on each other's appearance.\" Winky was shaking her head, trembling. \"Say no more. Master Barty, say no more, you is getting your father into trouble!\" But Crouch took another deep breath and continued in the same flat voice. \"The dementors are blind. They sensed one healthy, one dying person entering Azkaban. They sensed one healthy, one dying person leaving it. My father smuggled me out, disguised as my mother, in case any prisoners were watching through their doors. \"My mother died a short while afterward in Azkaban. She was careful to drink Polyjuice Potion until the end. She was buried under my name and bearing my appearance. Everyone believed her to be me.\" The man's eyelids flickered. \"And what did your father do with you, when he had got you home?\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"Staged my mother's death. A quiet, private funeral. That grave is empty. The houseelf nursed me back to health. Then I had to be concealed. I had to be controlled. My father had to use a number of spells to subdue me. When I had recovered my strength, I thought only of finding my master . . . of returning to his service.\" \"How did your father subdue you?\" said Dumbledore. \"The Imperius Curse,\" Moody said. \"I was under my fathers control. I was forced to wear an Invisibility Cloak day and night. I was always with the houseelf. She was my keeper and caretaker. She pitied me. She persuaded my father to give me occasional treats. Rewards for my good behavior.\" \"Master Barty, Master Barty,\" sobbed Winky through her hands. \"You isn't ought to tell them, we is getting in trouble. ...\" \"Did anybody ever discover that you were still alive?\" said Dumbledore softly. \"Did anyone know except your father and the houseelf?\" \"Yes,\" said Crouch, his eyelids flickering again. \"A witch in my father's office. Bertha Jorkins. She came to the house with papers for my father s signature. He was not at home. Winky showed her inside and returned to the kitchen, to me. But Bertha Jorkins heard Winky talking to me. She came to investigate. She heard enough to guess who was hiding under the Invisibility Cloak. My father arrived home. She confronted him. He put a very powerful Memory Charm on her to make her forget what she'd found out. Too powerful. He said it damaged her memory permanently.\" \"Why is she coming to nose into my masters private business?\" sobbed Winky. \"Why isn't she leaving us be?\" \"Tell me about the Quidditch World Cup,\" said Dumbledore. \"Winky talked my father into it,\" said Crouch, still in the same monotonous voice. \"She spent months persuading him. I had not left the house for years. I had loved Quidditch. Let him go, she said. He will be in his Invisibility Cloak. He can watch. Let him smell fresh air for once. She said my mother would have wanted it. She told my father that my mother had died to give me freedom. She had not saved me for a life of imprisonment. He agreed in the end. \"It was carefully planned. My father led me and Winky up to the Top Box early in the day. Winky was to say that she was saving a seat for my father. I was to sit there, invisible. When everyone had left the box, we would emerge. Winky would appear to be alone. Nobody would ever know. \"But Winky didn't know that I was growing stronger. I was starting to fight my father's Imperius Curse. There were times when I was almost myself again. There were brief periods when I seemed outside his control. It happened, there, in the Top Box. It was like waking from a deep sleep. I found myself out in public, in the middle of the match, and I saw, in front of me, a wand sticking out of a boys pocket. I had not been allowed a wand since before Azkaban. I stole it. Winky didn't know. Winky is frightened of heights. She had her face hidden.\" \"Master Barty, you bad boy!\" whispered Winky, tears trickling between her fingers. \"So you took the wand,\" said Dumbledore, \"and what did you do with it?\" \"We went back to the tent,\" said Crouch. \"Then we heard them. We heard the Death Eaters. The ones who had never been to Azkaban. The ones who had never suffered for my master. They had turned their backs on him. They were not enslaved, as I was. They were free to seek him, but they did not. They were merely making sport of Muggles. The sound of their voices awoke me. My mind was clearer than it had been in years. I was angry. I had the wand. I wanted to attack them for their disloyalty to my master. My father had left the tent; he had gone to free the Muggles. Winky was afraid to see me so angry. She used her own brand of magic to bind me to her. She pulled me from the tent, pulled me into the forest, away from the Death Eaters. I tried to hold her back. I wanted to return to the campsite. I wanted to show those Death Eaters what loyalty to the Dark Lord meant, and to punish them for their lack of it. I used the stolen wand to cast the Dark Mark into the sky. \"Ministry wizards arrived. They shot Stunning Spells everywhere. One of the spells came through the trees where Winky and I stood. The bond connecting us was broken. We were both Stunned. \"When Winky was discovered, my father knew I must be nearby. He searched the bushes where she had been found and felt me lying there. He waited until the other Ministry members had left the forest. He put me back under the Imperius Curse and took me home. He dismissed Winky. She had failed him. She had let me acquire a wand. She had almost let me escape.\" Winky let out a wail of despair. \"Now it was just Father and I, alone in the house. And then . . . and then . . .\" Crouch's head rolled on his neck, and an insane grin spread across his face. \"My master came for me. \"He arrived at our house late one night in the arms of his servant Wormtail. My master had found out that I was still alive. He had captured Bertha Jorkins in Albania. He had tortured her. She told him a great deal. She told him about the Triwizard Tournament. She told him the old Auror, Moody, was going to teach at Hogwarts. He tortured her until he broke through the Memory Charm my father had placed upon her. She told him I had escaped from Azkaban. She told him my father kept me imprisoned to prevent me from seeking my master. And so my master knew that I was still his faithful servant  perhaps the most faithful of all. My master conceived a plan, based upon the information Bertha had given him. He needed me. He arrived at our house near midnight. My father answered the door.\" The smile spread wider over Crouch's face, as though recalling the sweetest memory of his life. Winky's petrified brown eyes were visible through her fingers. She seemed too appalled to speak. \"It was very quick. My father was placed under the Imperius Curse by my master. Now my father was the one imprisoned, controlled. My master forced him to go about his business as usual, to act as though nothing was wrong. And I was released. I awoke. I was myself again, alive as I hadn't been in years. \"And what did Lord Voldemort ask you to do?\" said Dumbledore. \"He asked me whether I was ready to risk everything for him. I was ready. It was my dream, my greatest ambition, to serve him, to prove myself to him. He told me he needed to place a faithful servant at Hogwarts. A servant who would guide Harry Potter through the Triwizard Tournament without appearing to do so. A servant who would watch over Harry Potter. Ensure he reached the Triwizard Cup. Turn the cup into a Portkey, which would take the first person to touch it to my master. But first \" \"You needed Alastor Moody,\" said Dumbledore. His blue eyes were blazing, though his voice remained calm. \"Wormtail and I did it. We had prepared the Polyjuice Potion beforehand. We journeyed to his house. Moody put up a struggle. There was a commotion. We managed to subdue him just in time. Forced him into a compartment of his own magical trunk. Took some of his hair and added it to the potion. I drank it; I became Moody's double. I took his leg and his eye. I was ready to face Arthur Weasley when he arrived to sort out the Muggles who had heard a disturbance. I made the dustbins move around the yard. I told Arthur Weasley I had heard intruders in my yard, who had set off the dustbins. Then I packed up Moody's clothes and Dark detectors, put them in the trunk with Moody, and set off for Hogwarts. I kept him alive, under the Imperius Curse. I wanted to be able to question him. To find out about his past, learn his habits, so that I could fool even Dumbledore. I also needed his hair to make the Polyjuice Potion. The other ingredients were easy. I stole boomslang skin from the dungeons. When the Potions master found me in his office, I said I was under orders to search it.\" \"And what became of Wormtail after you attacked Moody?\" said Dumbledore. \"Wormtail returned to care for my master, in my father's house, and to keep watch over my father.\" \"But your father escaped,\" said Dumbledore. \"Yes. After a while he began to fight the Imperius Curse just as I had done. There were periods when he knew what was happening. My master decided it was no longer safe for my father to leave the house. He forced him to send letters to the Ministry instead. He made him write and say he was ill. But Wormtail neglected his duty. He was not watchful enough. My father escaped. My master guessed that he was heading for Hogwarts. My father was going to tell Dumbledore everything, to confess. He was going to admit that he had smuggled me from Azkaban. \"My master sent me word of my father's escape. He told me to stop him at all costs. So I waited and watched. I used the map I had taken from Harry Potter. The map that had almost ruined everything.\" \"Map?\" said Dumbledore quickly. \"What map is this?\" \"Potter's map of Hogwarts. Potter saw me on it. Potter saw me stealing more ingredients for the Polyjuice Potion from Snape's office one night. He thought I was my father. We have the same first name. I took the map from Potter that night. I told him my father hated Dark wizards. Potter believed my father was after Snape. \"For a week I waited for my father to arrive at Hogwarts. At last, one evening, the map showed my father entering the grounds. I pulled on my Invisibility Cloak and went down to meet him. He was walking around the edge of the forest. Then Potter came, and Krum. I waited. I could not hurt Potter; my master needed him. Potter ran to get Dumbledore. I Stunned Krum. I killed my father.\" \"Noooo!\" wailed Winky. \"Master Barty, Master Barty, what is you saying?\" \"You killed your father,\" Dumbledore said, in the same soft voice. \"What did you do with the body?\" \"Carried it into the forest. Covered it with the Invisibility Cloak. I had the map with me. I watched Potter run into the castle. He met Snape. Dumbledore joined them. I watched Potter bringing Dumbledore out of the castle. I walked back out of the forest, doubled around behind them, went to meet them. I told Dumbledore Snape had told me where to come. \"Dumbledore told me to go and look for my father. I went back to my father's body. Watched the map. When everyone was gone, I Transfigured my father's body. He became a bone ... I buried it, while wearing the Invisibility Cloak, in the freshly dug earth in front of Hagrid's cabin.\" There was complete silence now, except for Winky's continued sobs. Then Dumbledore said, \"And tonight. . .\" \"I offered to carry the Triwizard Cup into the maze before dinner,\" whispered Barty Crouch. \"Turned it into a Portkey. My master's plan worked. He is returned to power and I will be honored by him beyond the dreams of wizards.\" The insane smile lit his features once more, and his head drooped onto his shoulder as Winky wailed and sobbed at his side. \n",

            " SEVEN  THE SORTING HAT  The door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry's first thought was that this was not someone to cross.  \"The firs' years, Professor McGonagall,\" said Hagrid.  \"Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.\"  She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys' house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors.  They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right -the rest of the school must already be here -- but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously.  \"Welcome to Hogwarts,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room.  \"The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.  \"The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.\"  Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville's cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron's smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair.  \"I shall return when we are ready for you,\" said Professor McGonagall.  \"Please wait quietly.\"  She left the chamber. Harry swallowed.  \"How exactly do they sort us into houses?\" he asked Ron.  \"Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.\"  Harry's heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole school? But he didn't know any magic yet -- what on earth would he have to do? He hadn't expected something like this the moment they arrived.  He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she'd learned and wondering which one she'd need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He'd never been more nervous, never, not even when he'd had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he'd somehow turned his teacher's wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom.  Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air -- several people behind him screamed.  \"What the --?\"  He gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying: \"Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance --\"  \"My dear Friar, haven't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he's not really even a ghost -- I say, what are you all doing here?\"  A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.  Nobody answered.  \"New students!\" said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. \"About to be Sorted, I suppose?\"  A few people nodded mutely.  \"Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!\" said the Friar. \"My old house, you know.\"  \"Move along now,\" said a sharp voice. \"The Sorting Ceremony's about to start.\"  Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall.  \"Now, form a line,\" Professor McGonagall told the first years, \"and follow me.\"  Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.  Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting.  These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting.  Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them.  The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, \"Its bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.\"  It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn't simply open on to the heavens.  Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard's hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn't have let it in the house.  Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing -- noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth -- and the hat began to sing: \"Oh, you may not think I'm pretty, But don't judge on what you see, I'll eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me.  You can keep your bowlers black, Your top hats sleek and tall, For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat And I can cap them all.  There's nothing hidden in your head The Sorting Hat can't see, So try me on and I will tell you Where you ought to be.  You might belong in Gryffindor, Where dwell the brave at heart, Their daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart; You might belong in Hufflepuff, Where they are just and loyal, Those patient Hufflepuffis are true And unafraid of toil; Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, if you've a ready mind, Where those of wit and learning, Will always find their kind; Or perhaps in Slytherin You'll make your real friends, Those cunning folk use any means To achieve their ends.  So put me on! Don't be afraid! And don't get in a flap! You're in safe hands (though I have none) For I'm a Thinking Cap!\"  The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.  \"So we've just got to try on the hat!\" Ron whispered to Harry. \"I'll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.\"  Harry. smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather alot; Harry didn't feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.  Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.  \"When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,\" she said. \"Abbott, Hannah!\"  A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments pause -- \"HUFFLEPUFF!\" shouted the hat.  The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her.  \"Bones, Susan!\"  \"HUFFLEPUFF!\" shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah.  \"Boot, Terry!\"  \"RAVENCLAW!\"  The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.  \" Brocklehurst, Mandy\" went to Ravenclaw too, but \"Brown, Lavender\"  became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron's twin brothers catcalling.  \"Bulstrode, Millicent\" then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry's imagination, after all he'd heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot. He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school.  He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.  \"Finch-Fletchley, Justin!\"  \"HUFFLEPUFF!\"  Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. \"Finnigan, Seamus,\" the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.  \"Granger, Hermione!\"  Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.  \"GRYFFINDOR!\" shouted the hat. Ron groaned.  A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you're very nervous. What if he wasn't chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he'd better get back on the train? When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, \"GRYFFINDOR,\" Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to \"MacDougal, Morag.\"  Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, \"SLYTHERIN!\"  Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself.  There weren't many people left now. \"Moon\" \"Nott\" \"Parkinson\" then a pair of twin girls, \"Patil\" and \"Patil\" then \"Perks, Sally-Anne\" and then, at last -- \"Potter, Harry!\"  As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.  \"Potter, did she say?\"  The Harry Potter?\"  The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.  Hmm,\" said a small voice in his ear. \"Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There's talent, A my goodness, yes -- and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that's interesting....  So where shall I put you?\"  Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.  \"Not Slytherin, eh?\" said the small voice. \"Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that -- no? Well, if you're sure -- better be GRYFFINDOR!\"  Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, \"We got Potter! We got Potter!\" Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he'd seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he'd just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.  He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he'd gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore's silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirtell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.  And now there were only three people left to be sorted. \"Thomas, Dean,\"  a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table.  \"Turpin, Lisa,\" became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron's turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, \"GRYFFINDOR!\"  Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him.  \"Well done, Ron, excellent,\" said Percy Weasley Pompously across Harry as \"Zabini, Blaise,\" was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.  Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.  Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there.  \"Welcome,\" he said. \"Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! \"Thank you!\"  He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn't know whether to laugh or not.  \"Is he -- a bit mad?\" he asked Percy uncertainly.  \"Mad?\" said Percy airily. \"He's a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?\"  Harry's mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.  The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he'd never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat.  It was all delicious.  \"That does look good,\" said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak, \"Can't you --?\"  I haven't eaten for nearly four hundred years,\" said the ghost. \"I don't need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don't think I've in troduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.\"  \"I know who you are!\" said Ron suddenly. \"My brothers told me about you -- you're Nearly Headless Nick!\"  \"I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy --\" the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.  \"Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?\"  Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn't going at all the way he wanted.  \"Like this,\" he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, \"So -- new Gryffindors! I hope you're going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron's becoming almost unbearable -- he's the Slytherin ghost.\"  Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn't look too pleased with the seating arrangements.  \"How did he get covered in blood?\" asked Seamus with great interest.  \"I've never asked,\" said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.  When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding -- “  As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.  \"I'm half-and-half,\" said Seamus. \"Me dad's a Muggle. Mom didn't tell him she was a witch 'til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.\"  The others laughed.  \"What about you, Neville?\" said Ron.  \"Well, my gran brought me up and she's a witch,\" said Neville, \"but the family thought I was all- Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me -- he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned -- but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here -- they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.\"  On Harry's other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (\"I do hope they start right away, there's so much to learn, I'm particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it's supposed to be very difficult-\"; \"You'll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing -- \").  Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet.  Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.  It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell's turban straight into Harry's eyes -- and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry's forehead.  \"Ouch!\" Harry clapped a hand to his head.  \"What is it?\" asked Percy.  \"N-nothing.\"  The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher's look -- a feeling that he didn't like Harry at all.  \"Who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?\" he asked Percy.  \"Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he's looking so nervous, that's Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn't want to -- everyone knows he's after Quirrell's job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.\"  Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn't look at him again.  At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.  \"Ahern -- just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.  \"First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.\"  Dumbledore's twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.  \"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.  \"Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch.  \"And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.\"  Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.  \"He's not serious?\" he muttered to Percy.  \"Must be,\" said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. \"It's odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we're not allowed to go somewhere -- the forest's full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.\"  \"And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!\" cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers' smiles had become rather fixed.  Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.  \"Everyone pick their favorite tune,\" said Dumbledore, \"and off we go!\"  And the school bellowed: \"Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, Teach us something please, Whether we be old and bald Or young with scabby knees, Our heads could do with filling With some interesting stuff, For now they're bare and full of air, Dead flies and bits of fluff, So teach us things worth knowing, Bring back what we've forgot, just do your best, we'll do the rest, And learn until our brains all rot.  Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march.  Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.  \"Ah, music,\" he said, wiping his eyes. \"A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!\"  The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry's legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt.  A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.  \"Peeves,\" Percy whispered to the first years. \"A poltergeist.\" He raised his voice, \"Peeves -- show yourself\"  A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.  \"Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?\"  There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross- legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.  \"Oooooooh!\" he said, with an evil cackle. \"Ickle Firsties! What fun!\"  He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.  \"Go away, Peeves, or the Baron'll hear about this, I mean it!\" barked Percy.  Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville's head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.  \"You want to watch out for Peeves,\" said Percy, as they set off again.  \"The Bloody Baron's the only one who can control him, he won't even listen to us prefects. Here we are.\"  At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.  \"Password?\" she said. \"Caput Draconis,\" said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it -- Neville needed a leg up -- and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.  Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase -- they were obviously in one of the towers -- they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.  \" Great food, isn't it?\" Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings.  \"Get off, Scabbers! He's chewing my sheets.\"  Harry was going to ask Ron if he'd had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once.  Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell's turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn't want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully -- and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it -then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold -- there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.  He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn't remember the dream at all.  \n",

            " TWENTY-THREE Christmas on the Closed Ward Was this why Dumbledore would no longer meet Harry’s eyes? Did he expect to see Voldemort staring out of them, afraid, perhaps, that their vivid green might turn suddenly to scarlet, with catlike slits for pupils? Harry remembered how the snakelike face of Voldemort had once forced itself out of the back of Professor Quirrell’s head and ran his hand over the back of his own, wondering what it would feel like if Voldemort burst out of his skull. He felt dirty, contaminated, as though he were carrying some deadly germ, unworthy to sit on the Underground train back from the hospital with innocent, clean people whose minds and bodies were free of the taint of Voldemort... he had not merely seen the snake, he hadbeen the snake, he knew it now... A truly terrible thought then occurred to him, a memory bobbing to the surface of his mind, one that made his insides writhe and squirm like serpents. What’s he after, apart from followers? Stuff he can only get by stealth... like a weapon. Something he didn’t have last time. I’m the weapon, Harry thought, and it was as though poison were pumping through his veins, chilling him, bringing him out in a sweat as he swayed with the train through the dark tunnel. I’m the one Voldemorts trying to use, that’s why they’ve got guards around me everywhere I go, it’s not for my protection, it’s for other people’s, only it’s not working, they can’t have someone on me all the time at Hogwarts... I did attack Mr. Weasley last night, it was me. Voldemort made me do it and he could be inside me, listening to my thoughts right now - \"Are you all right, Harry, dear?\" whispered Mrs. Wea sley leaning across Ginny to speak to him as the train rattled along through its dark tunnel. \"You don’t look very well. Are you feeling sick?\" They were all watching him. He shook his head violently and stared up at an advertisement for home insurance. \"Harry, dear, are you sure you’re all right?\" said Mrs. Weasley in a worried voice, as they walked around the unkempt patch of grass in the middle of Grimmauld Place. \"You look ever so pale... are you sure you slept this morning? You go upstairs to bed right now and you can have a couple of hours of sleep before dinner, all right?\" He nodded; here was a ready-made excuse not to talk to any of the others, which was precisely what he wanted, so when she opened the front door he hurried straight past the troll’s-leg umbrella stand, up the stairs and into his and Ron’s bedroom. Here, he began to pace up and down, past the two beds and Phineas Nigellus’s empty picture frame, his brain teeming and seething with questions and ever more dreadful ideas. How had he become a snake? Perhaps he was an Animagus... no, he couldn’t be, he would know... perhapsVoldemort was an Animagus... yes, thought Harry, that would fit, he would turn into a snake of course... and when he’s possessing me, then we both transform... that still doesn’t explain how I got to London and back to my bed in the space of about five minutes... but then Voldemort’s about the most powerful wizard in the world, apart from Dumbledore, it’s probably no problem at all to him to transport people like that. And then, with a terrible stab of panic, he thought,but this is insane - if Voldemort’s possessing me, I’m giving him a clear view into the Headquarter s of the Order of the Phoenix right now! He’ll know who’s in the Order and where Sirius is... and I’ve heard loads of stuff I shouldn’t have, everything Sirius told me the first night I was here... There was only one thing for it: he would have to leave Grimmauld Place straightaway. He would spend Christmas at Hogwarts without the others, which would keep them safe over the holidays at least... but no, that wouldn’t do, there were still plenty of people at Hogwarts to maim and injure. What if it was Seamus, Dean or Neville next time? He stopped his pacing and stood staring at Phineas Nigellus’s empty frame. A leaden sensation was settling in the pit of his stomach. He had no alternative: he was going to have to return to Privet Drive, cut himself off from other wizards entirely. Well, if he had to do it, he thought, there was no point hanging around. Trying with all his might not to think how the Dursleys were going to react when they found him on their doorstep six months earlier than they had expected, he strode over to his trunk, slammed the lid shut and locked it, then glanced around automatically for Hedwig before remembering that she was still at Hogwarts - well, her cage would be one less thing to carry - he seized one end of his trunk and had dragged it halfway towards the door when a snide voice said, \"Running away, are we?\" He looked around. Phineas Nigellus had appeared on the canvas of his portrait and was leaning against the frame, watching Harry with an amused expression on his face. \"Not running away, no,\" said Harry shortly, dragging his trunk a few more feet across the room. \"I thought,\" said Phineas Nigellus, stroking his pointed beard, \"that to belong in Gryffindor house you were supposed to be brave! It looks to me as though you would have been better off in my own house. We Slytherins are brave, yes, but not stupid. For instance, given the choice, we will always choose to save our own necks.\" \"It’s not my own neck I’m saving,\" said Harry tersely, tugging the trunk over a patch of particularly uneven, moth-eaten carpet right in front of the door. \"Oh, I see,\" said Phineas Nigellus, still stroking his beard, \"this is no cowardly flight - you are being noble.\" Harry ignored him. His hand was on the doorknob when Phineas Nigellus said lazily, \"I have a message for you from Albus Dumbledore.\" Harry span round. \"What is it?\" \"‘Stay where you are.’\" \"I haven’t moved!\" said Harry, his hand still upon the doorknob. \"So what’s the message?\" \"I have just given it to you, dolt,\" said Phineas Ni gellus smoothly. \"Dumbledore says, ‘Stay where you are.’\" \"Why?\" said Harry eagerly, dropping the end of his trunk. \"Why does he want me to stay? What else did he say?\" \"Nothing whatsoever,\" said Phineas Nigellus, raising a thin black eyebrow as though he found Harry impertinent. Harry’s temper rose to the surface like a snake rearing from long grass. He was exhausted, he was confused beyond measure, he had experienced terror, relief, then terror again in the last twelve hours, and still Dumbledore did not want to talk to him! \"So that’s it, is it?\" he said loudly. \"‘Stay where you a re’! That’s all anyone could tell me after I got attacked by those Dementors, too! Just stay put while the grown-ups sort it out, Harry! We won’t bother telling you anything, though, because your tiny little brain might not be able to cope with it!\" \"You know,\" said Phineas Nigellus, even more loudly than Harry \"this is precisely why I loathed being a teacher! Young people are so infernally convinced that they are absolutely right about everything. Has it not occurred to you, my poor puffed-up popinjay, that there might be an excellent reason why the Headmaster of Hogwarts is not confiding every tiny detail of his plans to you? Have you never paused, while feeling hard-done-by, to note that following Dumbledores orders has never yet led you into harm? No. No, like all young people, you are quite sure that you alone feel and think, you alone recognize danger, you alone are the only one clever enough to realize what the Dark Lord may be planning -\" \"He is planning something to do with me, then?\" said Harry swiftly. \"Did I say that?\" said Phineas Nigellus, idly examining his silk gloves. \"Now, if you will excuse me, I have better things to do than listen to adolescent agonising... good-day to you.\" And he strolled to the edge of his frame and out of sight. \"Fine, go then!\" Harry bellowed at the empty frame. \"And tell Dumbledore thanks for nothing!\" The empty canvas remained silent. Fuming, Harry dragged his trunk back to the foot of his bed, then threw himself face down on the moth-eaten covers, his eyes shut, his body heavy and aching. He felt as though he had journeyed for miles and miles... it seemed impossible that less than twenty-four hours ago Cho Chang had been approaching him under the mistletoe... he was so tired... he was scared to sleep... yet he did not know how long he could fight it... Dumbledore had told him to stay... that must mean he was allowed to sleep... but he was scared... what if it happened again? He was sinking into shadows... It was as though a film in his head had been waiting to start. He was walking down a deserted corridor towards a plain black door, past rough stone walls, torches, and an open doorway on to a flight of stone steps leading downstairs on the left... He reached the black door but could not open it... he stood gazing at it, desperate for entry... something he wanted with all his heart lay beyond... a prize beyond his dreams... if only his scar would stop prickling... then he would be able to think more clearly... \"Harry,\" said Ron’s voice, from far, far away, \"Mum says dinner’s ready, but she’ll save you something if you want to stay in bed.\" Harry opened his eyes, but Ron had already left the room. He doesn’t want to be on his own with me, Harry thought. Not after what he heard Moody say. He supposed none of them would want him there any more, now that they knew what was inside him. He would not go down to dinner; he would not inflict his company on them. He turned over on to his other side and, after a while, dropped back off to sleep. He woke much later, in the early hours of the morning, his insides aching with hunger and Ron snoring in the next bed. Squinting around the room, he saw the dark outline of Phineas Nigellus standing again in his portrait and it occurred to Harry that Dumbledore had probably sent Phineas Nigellus to watch over him, in case he attacked somebody else. The feeling of being unclean intensified. He half-wished he had not obeyed Dumbledore... if this was how life was going to be for him in Grimmauld Place from now on, maybe he would be better off in Privet Drive after all. Everybody else spent the following morning putting up Christmas decorations. Harry could not remember Sirius ever being in such a good mood; he was actually singing carols, apparently delighted that he was to have company over Christmas. Harry could hear his voice echoing up through the floor in the cold drawing room where he was sitting alone, watching the sky growing whiter outside the windows, threatening snow, all the time feeling a savage pleasure that he was giving the others the opportunity to keep talking about him, as they were bound to be doing. When he heard Mrs. Weasley calling his name softly u p the stairs around lunchtime, he retreated further upstairs and ignored her. Around six o’clock in the evening the doorbell rang and Mrs. Black started screaming again. Assuming that Mundungus or some other Order member had come to call, Harry merely settled himself more comfortably against the wall of Buckbeak’s room where he was hiding, trying to ignore how hungry he felt as he fed dead rats to the Hippogriff. It came as a slight shock when somebody hammered hard on the door a few minutes later. \"I know you’re in there,\" said Hermione’s voice. \"Will you please come out? I want to talk to you.\" \"What are you doing here?\" Harry asked her, pulling open the door as Buckbeak resumed his scratching at the straw-strewn floor for any fragments of rat he may have dropped. \"I thought you were skiing with your mum and dad?\" \"Well, to tell the truth, skiing’s not really my thing,\" said Hermione. \"So, I’ve come here for Christmas.\" There was snow in her hair and her face was pink with cold. \"But don’t tell Ron. I told him it’s really good because he kept laughing so much. Mum and Dad are a bit disappointed, but I’ve told them that everyone who is serious about the exams is staying at Hogwarts to study. They want me to do well, they’ll understand. Anyway,\" she said briskly, \"let’s go to your bedroom, Ron’s mum has lit a fire in there and she’s sent up sandwiches.\" Harry followed her back to the second floor. When he entered the bedroom, he was rather surprised to see both Ron and Ginny waiting for them, sitting on Ron’s bed. \"I came on the Knight Bus,\" said Hermione airily, pulling off her jacket before Harry had time to speak. \"Dumbledore told me what had happened first thing this morning, but I had to wait for term to end officially before setting off. Umbridge is already livid that you lot disappeared right under her nose, even though Dumbledore told her Mr. Weasley was in St. Mungo’s and he’d given you all permission to visit. So...\" She sat down next to Ginny, and the two girls and Ron all looked up at Harry. \"How’re you feeling?\" asked Hermione. \"Fine,\" said Harry stiffly. \"Oh, don’t lie, Harry,\" she said impatiently. \"Ron and Ginny say you’ve been hiding from everyone since you got back from St. Mungo’s.\" \"They do, do they?\" said Harry, glaring at Ron and Ginny. Ron looked down at his feet but Ginny seemed quite unabashed. \"Well, you have!\" she said. \"And you won’t look at any of us!\" \"It’s you lot who won’t look at me!\" said Harry ang rily. \"Maybe you’re taking it in turns to look, and keep missing each other,\" suggested Hermione, the corners of her mouth twitching. \"Very funny,\" snapped Harry, turning away. \"Oh, stop feeling all misunderstood,\" said Hermione sharply. \"Look, the others have told me what you overheard last night on the Extendable Ears -\" \"Yeah?\" growled Harry, his hands deep in his pockets as he watched the snow now falling thickly outside. \"All been talking about me, have you? Well, I’m getting used to it.\" \"We wanted to talk to you, Harry,\" said Ginny, \"but as you’ve been hiding ever since we got back -\" \"I didn’t want anyone to talk to me,\" said Harry, w ho was feeling more and more nettled. \"Well, that was a bit stupid of you,\" said Ginny angrily, \"seeing as you don’t know anyone but me who’s been possessed by You-Know-Who, and I can tell you how it feels.\" Harry remained quite still as the impact of these words hit him. Then he wheeled round. \"I forgot,\" he said. \"Lucky you,\" said Ginny coolly. \"I’m sorry\" Harry said, and he meant it. \"So... so, do you think I’m being possessed, then?\" \"Well, can you remember everything you’ve been doing?\" Ginny asked. \"Are there big blank periods where you don’t know what you’ve been up to?\" Harry racked his brains. \"No,\" he said. \"Then You-Know-Who hasn’t ever possessed you,\" said Ginny simply. \"When he did it to me, I couldn’t remember what I’d been doing for hours at a time. I’d find myself somewhere and not know how I got there.\" Harry hardly dared believe her, yet his heart was lightening almost in spite of himself. \"That dream I had about your dad and the snake, though --\" \"Harry you’ve had these dreams before,\" Hermione said. \"You had flashes of what Voldemort was up to last year.\" \"This was different,\" said Harry, shaking his head. \"I was inside that snake. It was like I was the snake... what if Voldemort somehow transported me to London --?\" \"One day,\" said Hermione, sounding thoroughly exasperated, \"you’ll read Hogwarts: A History, and perhaps it will remind you that you can’t Apparate or Disapparate inside Hogwarts. Even Voldemort couldn’t just make you fly out of your dormitory, Harry.\" \"You didn’t leave your bed, mate,\" said Ron. \"I saw you thrashing around in your sleep for at least a minute before we could wake you up.\" Harry started pacing up and down the room again, thinking. What they were all saying was not only comforting, it made sense... without really thinking, he took a sandwich from the plate on the bed and crammed it hungrily into his mouth. I’m not the weapon after all, thought Harry. His heart swelled with happiness and relief, and he felt like joining in as they heard Sirius tramping past their door towards Buckbeak’s room, singing \"God Rest Ye, Merry Hippogriffs\" at the top of his voice. How could he have dreamed of returning to Privet Drive for Christmas? Sirius’s delight at having the house full again, and especially at having Harry back, was infectious. He was no longer their sullen host of the summer; now he seemed determined that everyone should enjoy themselves as much, if not more than they would have done at Hogwarts, and he worked tirelessly in the run-up to Christmas Day, cleaning and decorating with their help, so that by the time they all went to bed on Christmas Eve the house was barely recognisable. The tarnished chandeliers were no longer hung with cobwebs but with garlands of holly and gold and silver streamers; magical snow glittered in heaps over the threadbare carpets; a great Christmas tree, obtained by Mundungus and decorated with live fairies, blocked Sirius’s family tree from view, and even the stuffed elf-heads on the hall wall wore Father Christmas hats and beards. Harry awoke on Christmas morning to find a stack of presents at the foot of his bed and Ron already halfway through opening his own, rather larger, pile. \"Good haul this year,\" he informed Harry through a cloud of paper. \"Thanks for the Broom Compass, it’s excellent; beats Hermiones - she got me a homework planner-\" Harry sorted through his presents and found one with Hermiones handwriting on it. She had given him, too, a book that resembled a diary except that it said things like \"Do it today or later you'll pay!\" every time he opend a page. Sirius and Lupin had given Harry a set of excellent books entitled Practical Defensive Magic and its Use Against the Dark Arts, which had superb, moving color illustrations of all the counterjinxes and hexes it described. Harry flicked through the first volume eagerly; he could see it was going to be highly useful in his plans for the D.A.. Hagrid had sent a furry brown wallet that had fangs, which were presumably supposed to be an anti-theft device, but unfortunately prevented Harry putting any money in without getting his fingers ripped off. Tonks’s present was a small, working model of a Firebolt, which Harry watched fly around the room, wishing he still had his full-size version; Ron had given him an enormous box of Every-Flavour Beans, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley the usual hand-knitted jumper and some mince pies, and Dobby a truly dreadful painting that Harry suspected had been done by the elf himself. He had just turned it upsidedown to see whether it looked better that way when, with a loudcrack, Fred and George Apparated at the foot of his bed. \"Merry Christmas,\" said George. \"Don’t go downstairs for a bit.\" \"Why not?\" said Ron. \"Mum’s crying again,\" said Fred heavily. \"Percy sent back his Christmas jumper.\" \"Without a note,\" added George. \"Hasn’t asked how Dad is or visited him or anything.\" \"We tried to comfort her,\" said Fred, moving around the bed to look at Harry’s portrait. \"Told her Percy’s nothing more than a humungous pile of rat droppings.\" \"Didn’t work,\" said George, helping himself to a Chocolate Frog. \"So Lupin took over. Best let him cheer her up before we go down for breakfast, I reckon.\" \"What’s that supposed to be, anyway?\" asked Fred, squinting at Dobby’s painting. \"Looks like a gibbon with two black eyes.\" \"It’s Harry!\" said George, pointing at the back of the picture, \"says so on the back!\" \"Good likeness,\" said Fred, grinning. Harry threw his new homework diary at him; it hit the wall opposite and fell to the floor where it said happily: \"If you’ve dotted the ‘i’s and crossed the ‘t’s then you may do whatever you please!\" They got up and dressed. They could hear the various inhabitants of the house calling \"Merry Christmas\" to one another. On their way downstairs they met Hermione. \"Thanks for the book, Harry\" she said happily. \"I’ve been wanting that New Theory of Numerology for ages! And that perfume’s really unusual, Ron.\" \"No problem,\" said Ron. \"Who’s that for, anyway?\" he added, nodding at the neatly wrapped present she was carrying. \"Kreacher,\" said Hermione brightly. \"It had better not be clothes!\" Ron warned her. \"You know what Sirius said: Kreacher knows too much, we can’t set him free!\" \"It isn’t clothes,\" said Hermione, \"although if I had my way I’d certainly give him something to wear other than that filthy old rag. No, it’s a patchwork quilt, I thought it would brighten up his bedroom.\" \"What bedroom?\" said Harry, dropping his voice to a whisper as they were passing the portrait of Sirius’s mother. \"Well, Sirius says it’s not so much a bedroom, more a kind of -den,\" said Hermione. \"Apparently he sleeps under the boiler in that cupboard off the kitchen.\" Mrs. Weasley was the only person in the basement when they arrived there. She was standing at the stove and sounded as though she had a bad head cold as she wished them \"Merry Christmas,\" and they all averted their eyes. \"So, is this Kreacher’s bedroom?\" said Ron, strolling over to a dingy door in the corner opposite the pantry. Harry had never seen it open. \"Yes,\" said Hermione, now sounding a little nervous. \"Er... I think we’d better knock.\" Ron rapped on the door with his knuckles but there was no reply. \"He must be sneaking around upstairs,\" he said, and without further ado pulled open the door. \"Urgh!\" Harry peered inside. Most of the cupboard was taken up with a very large and old-fashioned boiler, but in the foot’s space underneath the pipes Kreacher had made himself something that looked like a nest. A jumble of assorted rags and smelly old blankets were piled on the floor and the small dent in the middle of it showed where Kreacher curled up to sleep every night. Here and there among the material were stale bread crusts and mouldy old bits of cheese. In a far corner glinted small objects and coins that Harry guessed Kreacher had saved, magpie-like, from Sirius’s purge of the house, and he had also managed to retrieve the silver-framed family photographs that Sirius had thrown away over the summer. Their glass might be shattered, but still the little black-and-white people inside them peered up at him haughtily, including - he felt a little jolt in his stomach - the dark, heavy-lidded woman whose trial he had witnessed in Dumbledore’s Pensieve: Bellatrix Lestrange. By the looks of it, hers was Kreacher’s favorite photograph; he had placed it to the fore of all the others and had mended the glass clumsily with Spellotape. \"I think I’ll just leave his present here,\" said Hermione, laying the package neatly in the middle of the depression in the rags and blankets and closing the door quietly. \"He’ll find it later, that’ll be fine.\" \"Come to think of it,\" said Sirius, emerging from the pantry carrying a large turkey as they closed the cupboard door, \"has anyone actually seen Kreacher lately?\" \"I haven’t seen him since the night we came back here,\" said Harry. \"You were ordering him out of the kitchen.\" \"Yeah...\" said Sirius, frowning. \"You know, I think that’s the last time I saw him, too... he must be hiding upstairs somewhere.\" \"He couldn’t have left, could he?\" said Harry. \"I mean, when you said ‘out’, maybe he thought you meant get out of the house?\" \"No, no, house-elves can’t leave unless they’re given clothes. They’re tied to their family’s house,\" said Sirius. \"They can leave the house if they really want to,\" Harry contradicted him. \"Dobby did, he left the Malfoys’ to give me warnings two years ago. He had to punish himself afterwards, but he still managed it.\" Sirius looked slightly disconcerted for a moment, then said, \"I’ll look for him later, I expect I’ll find him upstairs crying his eyes out over my mother’s old bloomers or something. Of course, he might have crawled into the airing cupboard and died... but I mustn’t get my hopes up.\" Fred, George and Ron laughed; Hermione, however, looked reproachful. Once they had eaten their Christmas lunch, the Weasleys, Harry and Hermione were planning to pay Mr. Weasley another visit, escorted by Mad-Eye and Lupin. Mundungus turned up in time for Christmas pudding and trifle, having managed to ‘borrow’ a car for the occasion, as the Underground did not run on Christmas Day. The car, which Harry doubted very much had been taken with the knowledge or consent of it's owner, had had a similar Enlarging Spell put upon it as the Weasley's old Ford Anglia; although normally proportioned outside, ten people with Mundungus driving were able to fit into it quite comfortably. Mrs. Weasley hesitated before getting inside - Harry knew her disapproval of Mundungus was battling with her dislike of traveling without magic - but, finally, the cold outside and her children’s pleading triumphed, and she settled herself into the back seat between Fred and Bill with good grace. The journey to St. Mungo’s was quite quick as there was very little traffic on the roads. A small trickle of witches and wizards was creeping furtively up the otherwise deserted street to visit the hospital. Harry and the others got out of the car, and Mundungus drove off around the corner to wait for them. They strolled casually towards the window where the dummy in green nylon stood, then, one by one, stepped through the glass. The reception area looked pleasantly festive: the crystal orbs that illuminated St. Mungo’s had been colored red and gold to become gigantic, glowing Christmas baubles; holly hung around every doorway; and shining white Christmas trees covered in magical snow and icicles glittered in every corner, each one topped with a gleaming gold star. It was less crowded than the last time they had been there, although halfway across the room Harry found himself shunted aside by a witch with a walnut jammed up her left nostril. \"Family argument, eh?\" smirked the blonde witch behind the desk. \"You’re the third I’ve seen today... Spell Damage, fourth floor.\" They found Mr. Weasley propped up in bed with the remains of his turkey dinner on a tray on his lap and a rather sheepish expression on his face. \"Everything all right, Arthur?\" asked Mrs. Weasley, after they had all greeted Mr. Weasley and handed over their presents. \"Fine, fine,\" said Mr. Weasley, a little too heartily. \"You -- er -- haven’t seen Healer Smethwyck, have you?\" \"No,\" said Mrs. Weasley suspiciously, \"why?\" \"Nothing, nothing,\" said Mr. Weasley airily, starting to unwrap his pile of gifts. \"Well, everyone had a good day? What did you all get for Christmas? Oh, Harry - this is absolutely wonderful!\" For he had just opened Harry’s gift of fuse-wire and screwdrivers. Mrs. Weasley did not seem entirely satisfied with Mr. Weasley’s answer. As her husband leaned over to shake Harry’s hand, she peered at the bandaging under his nightshirt. \"Arthur,\" she said, with a snap in her voice like a mousetrap, \"you’ve had your bandages changed. Why have you had your bandages changed a day early, Arthur? They told me they wouldn’t need doing until tomorrow.\" \"What?\" said Mr. Weasley, looking rather frightened and pulling the bed covers higher up his chest. \"No, no - it’s nothing - it’s -I-\" He seemed to deflate under Mrs. Weasley’s piercing gaze. \"Well - now don’t get upset, Molly, but Augustus Pye had an idea... he’s the Trainee Healer, you know, lovely young chap and very interested in... um... complementary medicine... I mean, some of these old Muggle remedies... well, they’re called stitches, Molly, and they work very well on - on Muggle wounds -\" Mrs. Weasley let out an ominous noise somewhere between a shriek and a snarl. Lupin strolled away from the bed and over to the werewolf, who had no visitors and was looking rather wistfully at the crowd around Mr. Weasley; Bill muttered something about getting himself a cup of tea and Fred and George leapt up to accompany him, grinning. \"Do you mean to tell me,\" said Mrs. Weasley, her voice growing louder with every word and apparently unaware that her fellow visitors were scurrying for cover, \"that you have been messing about with Muggle remedies?\" \"Not messing about, Molly, dear,\" said Mr. Weasley imploringly, \"it was just - just something Pye and I thought we’d try - only, most unfortunately -- well, with these particular kinds of wounds - it doesn’t seem to work as well as we’d hoped -\" \"Meaning?\" \"Well... well, I don’t know whether you know what - what stitches are?\" \"It sounds as though you’ve been trying to sew your skin back together,\" said Mrs. Weasley with a snort of mirthless laughter, \"but even you, Arthur, wouldn’t be that stupid --\" \"I fancy a cup of tea, too,\" said Harry, jumping to his feet. Hermione, Ron and Ginny almost sprinted to the door with him. As it swung closed behind them, they heard Mrs. Weasley shriek, \"WHAT DO YOU MEAN, TH AT’S THE GENERAL IDEA?\" \"Typical Dad,\" said Ginny, shaking her head as they set off up the corridor. \"Stitches... I ask you...\" \"Well, you know, they do work well on non-magical wounds,\" said Hermione fairly. \"I suppose something in that snake’s venom dissolves them or something. I wonder where the tearoom is?\" \"Fifth floor,\" said Harry, remembering the sign over the welcome witch’s desk. They walked along the corridor, through a set of double doors and found a rickety staircase lined with more portraits of brutal-looking Healers. As they climbed it, the various Healers called out to them, diagnosing odd complaints and suggesting horrible remedies. Ron was seriously affronted when a medieval wizard called out that he clearly had a bad case of spattergroit. \"And what’s that supposed to be?\" he asked angrily, as the Healer pursued him through six more portraits, shoving the occupants out of the way. \"Tis a most grievous affliction of the skin, young master, that will leave you pockmarked and more gruesome even than you are now -\" \"Watch who you’re calling gruesome!\" said Ron, his ears turning red. \"- the only remedy is to take the liver of a toad, bind it tight about your throat, stand naked at the full moon in a barrel of eels’ eyes -\" \"I have not got spattergroit!\" \"But the unsightly blemishes upon your visage, young master -\" \"They’re freckles!\" said Ron furiously. \"Now get back in your own picture and leave me alone!\" He rounded on the others, who were all keeping determinedly straight faces. \"What floor’s this?\" \"I think it’s the fifth,\" said Hermione. \"Nah, it’s the fourth,\" said Harry, \"one more --\" But as he stepped on to the landing he came to an abrupt halt, staring at the small window set into the double doors that marked the start of a corridor signposted SPELL DAMAGE. A man was peering out at them all with his nose pressed against the glass. He had wavy blond hair, bright blue eyes and a broad vacant smile that revealed dazzlingly white teeth. \"Blimey!\" said Ron, also staring at the man. \"Oh, my goodness,\" said Hermione suddenly, sounding breathless. \"Professor Lockhart!\" Their ex-Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher pushed open the doors and moved towards them, wearing a long lilac dressing gown. \"Well, hello there!\" he said. \"I expect you’d like my autograph, would you?\" \"Hasn’t changed much, has he?\" Harry muttered to Ginny, who grinned. \"Er -- how are you, Professor?\" said Ron, sounding slightly guilty. It had been Ron’s malfunctioning wand that had damaged Professor Lockhart’s memory so badly that he had landed in St. Mungo’s in the first place, though as Lockhart had been attempting to permanently wipe Harry and Ron’s memories at the time, Harrys sympathy was limited. \"I’m very well indeed, thank you!\" said Lockhart exuberantly, pulling a rather battered peacockfeather quill from his pocket. \"Now, how many autographs would you like? I can do joined-up writing now, you know!\" \"Er - we don’t want any at the moment, thanks,\" said Ron, raising his eyebrows at Harry, who asked, \"Professor, should you be wandering around the corridors? Shouldn’t you be in a ward?\" The smile faded slowly from Lockhart’s face. For a few moments he gazed intently at Harry, then he said, \"Haven’t we met?\" \"Er... yeah, we have,\" said Harry. \"You used to teach us at Hogwarts, remember?\" \"Teach?\" repeated Lockhart, looking faintly unsettled. \"Me? Did I?\" And then the smile reappeared upon his face so suddenly it was rather alarming. \"Taught you everything you know, I expect, did I? Well, how about those autographs, then? Shall we say a round dozen, you can give them to all your little friends then and nobody will be left out!\" But just then a head poked out of a door at the far end of the corridor and a voice called, \"Gilderoy, you naughty boy, where have you wandered off to?\" A motherly-looking Healer wearing a tinsel wreath in her hair came bustling up the corridor, smiling warmly at Harry and the others. \"Oh, Gilderoy, you’ve got visitors! How lovely, and on Christmas Day, too! Do you know, he never gets visitors, poor lamb, and I can’t think why, he’s such a sweetie, aren’t you?\" \"We’re doing autographs!\" Gilderoy told the Healer with another glittering smile. \"They want loads of them, won’t take no for an answer! I just hope we’ve got enough photographs!\" \"Listen to him,\" said the Healer, taking Lockhart’s arm and beaming fondly at him as though he were a precocious two-year-old. \"He was rather well known a few years ago; we very much hope that this liking for giving autographs is a sign that his memory might be starting to come back. Will you step this way? He’s in a closed ward, you know, he must have slipped out while I was bringing in the Christmas presents, the door’s usually kept locked... not that he’s dangerous! But,\" she lowered her voice to a whisper, \"he’s a bit of a danger to himself, bless him... doesn’t know who he is, you see, wanders off and can’t remember how to get back... it is nice of you to have come to see him.\" \"Er,\" said Ron, gesturing uselessly at the floor above, \"actually, we were just -- er -\" But the Healer was smiling expectantly at them, and Ron’s feeble mutter of \"going to have a cup of tea\" trailed away into nothingness. They looked at each other helplessly, then followed Lockhart and his Healer along the corridor. \"Let’s not stay long,\" Ron said quietly. The Healer pointed her wand at the door of the Janus Thickey Ward and muttered, \"Alohomora.\" The door swung open and she led the way inside, keeping a firm grasp on Gilderoys arm until she had settled him into an armchair beside his bed. \"This is our long-term residents’ ward,\" she informed Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny in a low voice. \"For permanent spell damage, you know. Of course, with intensive remedial potions and charms and a bit of luck, we can produce some improvement. Gilderoy does seem to be getting back some sense of himself; and we’ve seen a real improvement in Mr. Bode, he seems to be regaining th e power of speech very well, though he isn’t speaking any language we recognize yet. Well, I must finish giving out the Christmas presents, I’ll leave you all to chat.\" Harry looked around. The ward bore unmistakable signs of being a permanent home to its residents. They had many more personal effects around their beds than in Mr. Weasley’s ward; the wall around Gilderoy’s headboard, for instance, was papered with pictures of himself, all beaming toothily and waving at the new arrivals. He had autographed many of them to himself in disjointed, childish writing. The moment he had been deposited in his chair by the Healer, Gilderoy pulled a fresh stack of photographs towards him, seized a quill and started signing them all feverishly. \"You can put them in envelopes,\" he said to Ginny, throwing the signed pictures into her lap one by one as he finished them. \"I am not forgotten, you know, no, I still receive a very great deal of fan mail... Gladys Gudgeon writes weekly... I just wish I knew why.\" He paused, looking faintly puzzled, then beamed again and returned to his signing with renewed vigour. \"I suspect it is simply my good looks...\" A sallow-skinned, mournful-looking wizard lay in the bed opposite staring at the ceiling; he was mumbling to himself and seemed quite unaware of anything around him. Two beds along was a woman whose entire head was covered in fur; Harry remembered something similar happening to Hermione during their second year, although fortunately the damage, in her case, had not been permanent. At the far end of the ward flowery curtains had been drawn around two beds to give the occupants and their visitors some privacy. \"Here you are, Agnes,\" said the Healer brightly to the furry-faced woman, handing her a small pile of Christmas presents. \"See, not forgotten, are you? And your son’s sent an owl to say he’s visiting tonight, so that’s nice, isn’t it?\" Agnes gave several loud barks. \"And look, Broderick, you’ve been sent a potted plant and a lovely calendar with a different fancy Hippogriff for each month; they’ll brighten things up, won’t they?\" said the Healer, bustling along to the mumbling man, setting a rather ugly plant with long, swaying tentacles on the bedside cabinet and fixing the calendar to the wall with her wand. \"And - oh, Mrs. Longbottom, are you leaving already?\" Harry’s head span round. The curtains had been drawn back from the two beds at the end of the ward and two visitors were walking back down the aisle between the beds: a formidable-looking old witch wearing a long green dress, a moth-eaten fox fur and a pointed hat decorated with what was unmistakeably a stuffed vulture and, trailing behind her looking thoroughly depressed - Neville. With a sudden rush of understanding, Harry realized who the people in the end beds must be. He cast around wildly for some means of distracting the others so that Neville could leave the ward unnoticed and unquestioned, but Ron had also looked up at the sound of the name \"Longbottom\", and before Harry could stop him had called out, \"Neville!\" Neville jumped and cowered as though a bullet had narrowly missed him. \"It’s us, Neville!\" said Ron brightly, getting to h i s feet. \"Have you seen -? Lockhart’s here! Who’ve you been visiting?\" \"Friends of yours, Neville, dear?\" said Neville’s grandmother graciously, bearing down upon them all. Neville looked as though he would rather be anywhere in the world but here. A dull purple flush was creeping up his plump face and he was not making eye contact with any of them. \"Ah, yes,\" said his grandmother, looking closely at Harry and sticking out a shrivelled, clawlike hand for him to shake. \"Yes, yes, I know who you are, of course. Neville speaks most highly of you.\" \"Er - thanks,\" said Harry, shaking hands. Neville did not look at him, but surveyed his own feet, the color deepening in his face all the while. \"And you two are clearly Weasleys,\" Mrs. Longbottom continued, proffering her hand regally to Ron and Ginny in turn. \"Yes, I know your parents -- not well, of course -- but fine people, fine people... and you must be Hermione Granger?\" Hermione looked rather startled that Mrs. Longbottom knew her name, but shook hands all the same. \"Yes, Neville’s told me all about you. Helped him out of a few sticky spots, haven’t you? He’s a good boy,\" she said, casting a sternly appraising look down her rather bony nose at Neville, \"but he hasn’t got his father’s talent, I’m afraid to say.\" And she jerked her head in the direction of the two beds at the end of the ward, so that the stuffed vulture on her hat trembled alarmingly. \"What?\" said Ron, looking amazed. (Harry wanted to stamp on Ron’s foot, but that sort of thing is much harder to bring off unnoticed when you’re wearing jeans rather than robes.) \"Is that your dad down the end, Neville?\" \"What’s this?\" said Mrs. Longbottom sharply. \"Haven’t you told your friends about your parents, Neville?\" Neville took a deep breath, looked up at the ceiling and shook his head. Harry could not remember ever feeling sorrier for anyone, but he could not think of any way of helping Neville out of the situation. \"Well, it’s nothing to be ashamed of!\" said Mrs. Longbottom angrily. \"You should be proud, Neville, proud! They didn’t give their health and their sanity so their only son would be ashamed of them, you know!\" \"I’m not ashamed,\" said Neville, very faintly, still looking anywhere but at Harry and the others. Ron was now standing on tiptoe to look over at the inhabitants of the two beds. \"Well, you’ve got a funny way of showing it!\" said Mrs. Longbottom. \"My son and his wife,\" she said, turning haughtily to Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny, \"were tortured into insanity by You- Know-Who’s followers.\" Hermione and Ginny both clapped their hands over their mouths. Ron stopped craning his neck to catch a glimpse of Neville’s parents and looked mortified. \"They were Aurors, you know, and very well respected within the wizarding community\" Mrs. Longbottom went on. \"Highly gifted, the pair of them. I - yes, Alice dear, what is it?\" Neville’s mother had come edging down the ward in her nightdress. She no longer had the plump, happy-looking face Harry had seen in Moody’s old photograph of the original Order of the Phoenix. Her face was thin and worn now, her eyes seemed overlarge and her hair, which had turned white, was wispy and dead-looking. She did not seem to want to speak, or perhaps she was not able to, but she made timid motions towards Neville, holding something in her outstretched hand. \"Again?\" said Mrs. Longbottom, sounding slightly weary. \"Very well, Alice dear, very well - Neville, take it, whatever it is.\" But Neville had already stretched out his hand, into which his mother dropped an empty Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum wrapper. \"Very nice, dear,\" said Neville’s grandmother in a falsely cheery voice, patting his mother on the shoulder. But Neville said quietly, \"Thanks, Mum.\" His mother tottered away, back up the ward, humming to herself. Neville looked around at the others, his expression defiant, as though daring them to laugh, but Harry did not think he’d ever found anything less funny in his life. \"Well, we’d better get back,\" sighed Mrs Longbottom, drawing on long green gloves. \"Very nice to have met you all. Neville, put that wrapper in the bin, she must have given you enough of them to paper your bedroom by now.\" But as they left, Harry was sure he saw Neville slip the candy wrapper into his pocket. The door closed behind them. \"I never knew,\" said Hermione, who looked tearful. \"Nor did I,\" said Ron rather hoarsely. \"Nor me,\" whispered Ginny. They all looked at Harry. \"I did,\" he said glumly. \"Dumbledore told me but I promised I wouldn’t tell anyone... that’s what Bellatrix Lestrange got sent to Azkaban for, using the Cruciatus Curse on Neville’s parents until they lost their minds.\" \"Bellatrix Lestrange did that?\" whispered Hermione, horrified. \"That woman Kreacher’s got a photo of in his den?\" There was a long silence, broken by Lockharts angry voice. \"Look, I didn’t learn joined-up writing for nothing, you know!\" \n",

            " SEVENTEEN  \t THE MAN WITH TWO FACES It was Quirrell.  \t \"You!\" gasped Harry.  \t Quirrell smiled. His face wasn't twitching at all.  \t \"Me,\" he said calmly. \"I wondered whether I'd be meeting you here, Potter.\"  \t \"But I thought -- Snape --\"  \t \"Severus?\" Quirrell laughed, and it wasn't his usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp. \"Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn't he? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?\"  \t Harry couldn't take it in. This couldn't be true, it couldn't.  \t \"But Snape tried to kill me!\"  \t \"No, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and I'd have got you off that broom. I'd have managed it before then if Snape hadn't been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you.\"  \t \"Snape was trying to save me?\"  \t \"Of course,\" said Quirrell coolly. \"\\Why do you think he wanted to referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn't do it again. Funny, really... he needn't have bothered. I couldn't do anything with Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular...  \t and what a waste of time, when after all that, I'm going to kill you tonight.\"  \t Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry.  \t \"You're too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that, for all I knew you'd seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone.\"  \t \"You let the troll in?\"  \t \"Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls -- you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off -- and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn't even manage to bite Snape's leg off properly.  \t \"Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.  \t It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell.  \t It was the Mirror of Erised.  \t \"This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,\" Quirrell murmured, tapping his way around the frame. \"Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this... but he's in London... I'll be far away by the time he gets back....\"  \t All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror.  \t \"I saw you and Snape in the forest --\" he blurted out.  \t \"Yes,\" said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back. \"He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I'd got.  \t He suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me - as though he could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side....\"  \t Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it.  \t \"I see the Stone... I'm presenting it to my master... but where is it?\"  \t Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn't give. He had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror.  \t \"But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.\"  \t \"Oh, he does,\" said Quirrell casually, \"heavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts with your father, didn't you know? They loathed each other. But he never wanted you dead.\"  \t \"But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing -- I thought Snape was threatening you....\"  \t For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell's face.  \t \"Sometimes,\" he said, \"I find it hard to follow my master's instructions -- he is a great wizard and I am weak --\"  \t \"You mean he was there in the classroom with you?\" Harry gasped.  \t \"He is with me wherever I go,\" said Quirrell quietly. \"I met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it.... Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me.\"  \t Quirrell shivered suddenly. \"He does not forgive mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me... decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me....\"  \t Quirrell's voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon Alley -how could he have been so stupid? He'd seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.  \t Quirrell cursed under his breath.  \t \"I don't understand... is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break it?\"  \t Harry's mind was racing.  \t What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I should see myseff finding it -- which means I'll see where it's hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I'm up to? He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking to himself. \"What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!\"  \t And to Harry's horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell himself \"Use the boy... Use the boy...\"  \t Quirrell rounded on Harry.  \t \"Yes -- Potter -- come here.\"  \t He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry got slowly to his feet.  \t \"Come here,\" Quirrell repeated. \"Look in the mirror and tell me what you see.\"  \t Harry walked toward him.  \t I must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie about what I see, that's all.  \t Quirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell's turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again.  \t He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a moment later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood-red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket -- and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket. Somehow -- incredibly -- he'd gotten the Stone.  \t \"Well?\" said Quirrell impatiently. \"What do you see?\"  \t Harry screwed up his courage.  \t \"I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,\" he invented. \"I -- I've won the house cup for Gryffindor.\"  \t Quirrell cursed again.  \t \"Get out of the way,\" he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt the Sorcerer's Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it? But he hadn't walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasn't moving his lips.  \t \"He lies... He lies...\"  \t \"Potter, come back here!\" Quirrell shouted. \"Tell me the truth! What did you just see?\"  \t The high voice spoke again.  \t \"Let me speak to him... face-to-face...\"  \t \"Master, you are not strong enough!\"  \t \"I have strength enough... for this....\"  \t Harry felt as if Devil's Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn't move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrell's head looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the spot.  \t Harry would have screamed, but he couldn't make a sound. Where there should have been a back to Quirrell's head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake.  \t \"Harry Potter...\" it whispered.  \t Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn't move.  \t \"See what I have become?\" the face said. \"Mere shadow and vapor ... I have form only when I can share another's body... but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds.... Unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks... you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the forest... and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be able to create a body of my own.... Now... why don't you give me that Stone in your pocket?\"  \t So he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry's legs. He stumbled backward.  \t \"Don't be a fool,\" snarled the face. \"Better save your own life and join me... or you'll meet the same end as your parents.... They died begging me for mercy...\"  \t \"LIAR!\" Harry shouted suddenly.  \t Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see him. The evil face was now smiling.  \t \"How touching...\" it hissed. \"I always value bravery... Yes, boy, your parents were brave.... I killed your father first; and he put up a courageous fight... but your mother needn't have died... she was trying to protect you.... Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain.\"  \t \"NEVER!\"  \t Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed \"SEIZE HIM!\"  \t and the next second, Harry felt Quirrell's hand close on his wrist. At once, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry's scar; his head felt as though it was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head lessened -- he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers -- they were blistering before his eyes.  \t \"Seize him! SEIZE HIM!\" shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet' landing on top of him, both hands around Harry's neck -- Harry's scar was almost blinding him with pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony.  \t \"Master, I cannot hold him -- my hands -- my hands!\"  \t And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms -- Harry could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.  \t \"Then kill him, fool, and be done!\" screeched Voldemort.  \t Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell's face -- \"AAAARGH!\"  \t Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn't touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain -- his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse.  \t Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off -- the pain in Harry's head was building -- he couldn't see -- he could only hear Quirrell's terrible shrieks and Voldemort's yells of, \"KILL HIM! KILL HIM!\" and other voices, maybe in Harry's own head, crying, \"Harry! Harry!\"  \t He felt Quirrell's arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down ... down... down...  \t Something gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to catch it, but his arms were too heavy.  \t He blinked. It wasn't the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How strange.  \t He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above him.  \t \"Good afternoon, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: \"Sir! The Stone! It was Quirrell! He's got the Stone! Sir, quick --\"  \t \"Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,\" said Dumbledore. \"Quirrell does not have the Stone.\"  \t \"Then who does? Sir, I --\"  \t \"Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.  \t Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.  \t \"Tokens from your friends and admirers,\" said Dumbledore, beaming. \"What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it.\"  \t \"How long have I been in here?\"  \t \"Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried.\"  \t \"But sit, the Stone I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must say.  \t \"You got there? You got Hermione's owl?\"  \t \"We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you.\"  \t \"It was you.\"  \t \"I feared I might be too late.\"  \t \"You nearly were, I couldn't have kept him off the Stone much longer --\"  \t \"Not the Stone, boy, you -- the effort involved nearly killed you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has been destroyed.\"  \t \"Destroyed?\" said Harry blankly. \"But your friend -- Nicolas Flamel --\"  \t \"Oh, you know about Nicolas?\" said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted.  \t \"You did do the thing properly, didn't you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it's all for the best.\"  \t \"But that means he and his wife will die, won't they?\"  \t \"They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes, they will die.\"  \t Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry's face.  \t \"To one as young as you, I'm sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings would choose above all -- the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.\" Harry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling.  \t \"Sir?\" said Harry. \"I've been thinking... sir -- even if the Stone's gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know- Who --\"  \t \"Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.\"  \t \"Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort's going to try other ways of coming back, isn't he? I mean, he hasn't gone, has he?\"  \t \"No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share... not being truly alive, he cannot be killed.  \t He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time -- and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never return to power.\"  \t Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Then he said, \"Sir, there are some other things I'd like to know, if you can tell me... things I want to know the truth about....\"  \t \"The truth.\" Dumbledore sighed. \"It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you'll forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.\"  \t \"Well... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the first place?\"  \t Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time.  \t \"Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not now. You will know, one day... put it from your mind for now, Harry.  \t When you are older... I know you hate to hear this... when you are ready, you will know.\"  \t And Harry knew it would be no good to argue.  \t \"But why couldn't Quirrell touch me?\"  \t \"Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn't realize that love as powerful as your mother's for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign... to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.\"  \t Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice again, Harry said, \"And the invisibility cloak - do you know who sent it to me?\"  \t \"Ah - your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it.\" Dumbledore's eyes twinkled. \"Useful things... your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here.\"  \t \"And there's something else...\"  \t \"Fire away.\"  \t \"Quirrell said Snape --\"  \t \"Professor Snape, Harry.\" \"Yes, him -- Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father. Is that true?\"  \t \"Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr. Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive.\"  \t \"What?\"  \t \"He saved his life.\"  \t \"What?\"  \t \"Yes...\" said Dumbledore dreamily. \"Funny, the way people's minds work, isn't it? Professor Snape couldn't bear being in your father's debt....  \t I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even. Then he could go back to hating your father's memory in peace....\"  \t Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped.  \t \"And sir, there's one more thing...\"  \t \"Just the one?\"  \t \"How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?\"  \t \"Ah, now, I'm glad you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that's saying something. You see, only one who wanted to find the Stone -- find it, but not use it -- would be able to get it, otherwise they'd just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My brain surprises even me sometimes.... Now, enough questions. I suggest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomitflavored one, and since then I'm afraid I've rather lost my liking for them -- but I think I'll be safe with a nice toffee, don't you?\"  \t He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. Then he choked and said, \"Alas! Ear wax!\"  \t Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict.  \t \"Just five minutes,\" Harry pleaded.  \t \"Absolutely not.\"  \t \"You let Professor Dumbledore in...\"  \t \"Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You need rest.\"  \t \"I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam Pomfrey...\"  \t \"Oh, very well,\" she said. \"But five minutes only.\"  \t And she let Ron and Hermione in.  \t \"Harry!\"  \t Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.  \t \"Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to -- Dumbledore was so worried --\"  \t \"The whole school's talking about it,\" said Ron. \"What really happened?\"  \t It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were a very good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told them what was under Quirrell's turban, Hermione screamed out loud.  \t \"So the Stone's gone?\" said Ron finally. \"Flamel's just going to die?\"  \t \"That's what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that -- what was it? -- 'to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.  \t \"I always said he was off his rocker,\" said Ron, looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was.  \t \"So what happened to you two?\" said Harry.  \t \"Well, I got back all right,\" said Hermione. \"I brought Ron round -- that took a while -- and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall -- he already knew -- he just said, 'Harry's gone after him, hasn't he?' and hurtled off to the third floor.\"  \t \"D'you think he meant you to do it?\" said Ron. \"Sending you your father's cloak and everything?\"  \t \"Well, \" Hermione exploded, \"if he did -- I mean to say that's terrible -- you could have been killed.\"  \t \"No, it isn't,\" said Harry thoughtfully. \"He's a funny man, Dumbledore.  \t I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don't think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It's almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could....\"  \t \"Yeah, Dumbledore's off his rocker, all right,\" said Ron proudly.  \t \"Listen, you've got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course -- you missed the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you -- but the food'll be good.\"  \t At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.  \t \"You've had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT\" she said firmly.  \t After a good night's sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal.  \t I want to go to the feast,\" he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes. I can, can't I?\"  \t \"Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,\" she said stiffily, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn't realize how risky feasts could be. \"And you have another visitor.\"  \t \"Oh, good,\" said Harry. \"Who is it?\"  \t Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next to Harry, took one look at him, and burst into tears.  \t \"It's -- all -- my -- ruddy -- fault!\" he sobbed, his face in his hands.  \t I told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the only thing he didn't know, an' I told him! Yeh could've died! All fer a dragon egg! I'll never drink again! I should be chucked out an' made ter live as a Muggle!\"  \t \"Hagrid!\" said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into his beard. \"Hagrid, he'd have found out somehow, this is Voldemort we're talking about, he'd have found out even if you hadn't told him.\"  \t \"Yeh could've died!\" sobbed Hagrid. \"An' don' say the name!\"  \t \"VOLDEMORT!\" Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he stopped crying. \"I've met him and I'm calling him by his name. Please cheer up, Hagrid, we saved the Stone, it's gone, he can't use it. Have a Chocolate Frog, I've got loads....\"  \t Hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, \"That reminds me. I've got yeh a present.\"  \t \"It's not a stoat sandwich, is it?\" said Harry anxiously, and at last Hagrid gave a weak chuckle. \"Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it. 'Course, he shoulda sacked me instead -- anyway, got yeh this...\"  \t It seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. Harry opened it curiously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father.  \t \"Sent owls off ter all yer parents' old school friends, askin' fer photos... knew yeh didn' have any... d'yeh like it?\"  \t Harry couldn't speak, but Hagrid understood.  \t Harry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night. He had been held up by Madam Pomfrey's fussing about, insisting on giving him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin's winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table.  \t When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him.  \t Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away.  \t \"Another year gone!\" Dumbledore said cheerfully. \"And I must trouble you with an old man's wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were... you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts....  \t \"Now, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy- two.\"  \t A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table.  \t Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a sickening sight.  \t \"Yes, Yes, well done, Slytherin,\" said Dumbledore. \"However, recent events must be taken into account.\"  \t The room went very still. The Slytherins' smiles faded a little.  \t \"Ahem,\" said Dumbledore. \"I have a few last-minute points to dish out.  \t Let me see. Yes...  \t \"First -- to Mr. Ronald Weasley...\"  \t Ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.  \t \"...for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\"  \t Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, \"My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall's giant chess set!\"  \t At last there was silence again.  \t \"Second -- to Miss Hermione Granger... for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\"  \t Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves -- they were a hundred points up. \"Third -- to Mr. Harry Potter...\" said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points.\"  \t The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points -- exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup -- if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.  \t Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.  \t \"There are all kinds of courage,\" said Dumbledore, smiling. \"It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.\"  \t Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before.  \t Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn't have looked more stunned and horrified if he'd just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him.  \t \"Which means, Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, \"we need a little change of decoration.\"  \t He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall's hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry's eye and Harry knew at once that Snape's feelings toward him hadn't changed one jot. This didn't worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts.  \t It was the best evening of Harry's life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls... he would never, ever forget tonight.  \t Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn't have everything in life.  \t And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville's toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays (\"I always hope they'll forget to give us these,\" said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King's Cross Station.  \t It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn't attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles.  \t \"You must come and stay this summer,\" said Ron, \"both of you -- I'll send you an owl.\"  \t \"Thanks,\" said Harry, \"I'll need something to look forward to.\" People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world. Some of them called: \"Bye, Harry!\"  \t \"See you, Potter!\"  \t \"Still famous,\" said Ron, grinning at him.  \t \"Not where I'm going, I promise you,\" said Harry.  \t He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together. \"There he is, Mom, there he is, look!\"  \t It was Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister, but she wasn't pointing at Ron.  \t \"Harry Potter!\" she squealed. \"Look, Mom! I can see \"Be quiet, Ginny, and it's rude to point.\"  \t Mrs. Weasley smiled down at them.  \t \"Busy year?\" she said.  \t \"Very,\" said Harry. \"Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs. Weasley.\"  \t \"Oh, it was nothing, dear.\"  \t \"Ready, are you?\"  \t It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry.  \t \"You must be Harry's family!\" said Mrs. Weasley.  \t \"In a manner of speaking,\" said Uncle Vernon. \"Hurry up, boy, we haven't got all day.\" He walked away.  \t Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.  \t \"See you over the summer, then.\"  \t \"Hope you have -- er -- a good holiday,\" said Hermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant.  \t \"Oh, I will,\" said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face. \"They don't know we're not allowed to use magic at home. I'm going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer....\"  1 HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS by J. K. Rowling (this is BOOK 2 in the Harry Potter series) Original Scanned/OCR: Friday, April 07, 2000 v1.0 (edit where needed, change version number by 0.1) C H A P T E O N E THE WORST BIRTHDAY Not for the first time, an argument had broken out over breakfast at number four, Privet Drive. Mr. Vernon Dursley had been woken in the early hours of the morning by a loud, hooting noise from his nephew Harry's room. \"Third time this week!\" he roared across the table. \"If you can't control that owl, it'll have to go!\" Harry tried, yet again, to explain. \"She's bored,\" he said. \"She's used to flying around outside. If I could just let her out at night -\" \"Do I look stupid?\" snarled Uncle Vernon, a bit of fried egg dangling from his bushy mustache. \"I know what'll happen if that owl's let out.\" He exchanged dark looks with his wife, Petunia. Harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long, loud belch from the Dursleys' son, Dudley. 2 \"I want more bacon.\" \"There's more in the frying pan, sweetums,\" said Aunt Petunia, turning misty eyes on her massive son. \"We must build you up while we've got the chance .... I don't like the sound of that school food ...... \"Nonsense, Petunia, I never went hungry when I was at Smeltings,\" said Uncle Vernon heartily. \"Dudley gets enough, don't you, son?\" Dudley, who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of the kitchen chair, grinned and turned to Harry. \"Pass the frying pan.\" \"You've forgotten the magic word,\" said Harry irritably. The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was incredible: Dudley gasped and fell off his chair with a crash that shook the whole kitchen; Mrs. Dursley gave a small scream and clapped her hands to her mouth; Mr. Dursley jumped to his feet, veins throbbing in his temples. \"I meant `please'!\" said Harry quickly. \"I didn't mean -\" \"WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU,\" thundered his uncle, spraying spit over the table, \"ABOUT SAYING THE `M' WORD IN OUR HOUSE?\" \"But I -\" \"HOW DARE YOU THREATEN DUDLEY!\" roared Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with his fist. \"I just -\" \"I WARNED YOU! I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION OF YOUR ABNORMALITY UNDER THIS ROOF!\" Harry stared from his purple-faced uncle to his pale aunt, who was trying to heave Dudley to his feet. 3 \"All right,\" said Harry, \"all right. . . \" Uncle Vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded rhinoceros and watching Harry closely out of the corners of his small, sharp eyes. Ever since Harry had come home for the summer holidays, Uncle Vernon had been treating him like a bomb that might go off at any moment, because Harry Potter wasn't a normal boy. As a matter of fact, he was as not normal as it is possible to be. Harry Potter was a wizard - a wizard fresh from his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. And if the Dursleys were unhappy to have him back for the holidays, it was nothing to how Harry felt. He missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a constant stomachache. He missed the castle, with its secret passageways and ghosts, his classes (though perhaps not Snape, the Potions master), the mail arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, sleeping in his four-poster bed in the tower dormitory, visiting the gamekeeper, Hagrid, in his cabin next to the Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and, especially, Quidditch, the most popular sport in the wizarding world (six tall goal posts, four flying balls, and fourteen players on broomsticks). All Harry's spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and top-of-the-line Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant Harry had come home. What did the Dursleys care if Harry lost his place on the House Quidditch team because he hadn't practiced all summer? What was it to the Dursleys if Harry went back to school without any of his homework done? The Dursleys were what wizards called Muggles (not a drop of magical blood in their veins), and as far as they were concerned, having a wizard in the family was a matter of deepest shame. Uncle Vernon had even padlocked Harry's owl, Hedwig, inside her cage, to stop her from carrying messages to anyone in the wizarding world. Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle Vernon was large and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; Aunt Petunia 4 was horse-faced and bony; Dudley was blond, pink, and porky. Harry, on the other hand, was small and skinny, with brilliant green eyes and jet-black hair that was always untidy. He wore round glasses, and on his forehead was a thin, lightning-shaped scar. It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for a wizard. This scar was the only hint of Harry's very mysterious past, of the reason he had been left on the Dursleys' doorstep eleven years before. At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse from the greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose name most witches and wizards still feared to speak. Harry's parents had died in Voldemort's attack, but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar, and somehow - nobody understood why Voldemort's powers had been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill Harry. So Harry had been brought up by his dead mother's sister and her husband. He had spent ten years with the Dursleys, never understanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaning to, believing the Dursleys' story that he had got his scar in the car crash that had killed his parents. And then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to Harry, and the whole story had come out. Harry had taken up his place at wizard school, where he and his scar were famous ... but now the school year was over, and he was back with the Dursleys for the summer, back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in something smelly. The Dursleys hadn't even remembered that today happened to be Harry's twelfth birthday. Of course, his hopes hadn't been high; they'd never given him a real present, let alone a cake - but to ignore it completely ... At that moment, Uncle Vernon cleared his throat importantly and said, \"Now, as we all know, today is a very important day.\" Harry looked up, hardly daring to believe it. \"This could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career, \" 5 said Uncle Vernon. Harry went back to his toast. Of course, he thought bitterly, Un cle Vernon was talking about the stupid dinner party. He'd been talk ing of nothing else for two weeks. Some rich builder and his wife were coming to dinner and Uncle Vernon was hoping to get a huge order from him (Uncle Vernon's company made drills). \"I think we should run through the schedule one more time,\" said Uncle Vernon. \"We should all be in position at eight o'clock. Petunia, you will be -?\" \"In the lounge,\" said Aunt Petunia promptly, \"waiting to welcome them graciously to our home.\" \"Good, good. And Dudley?\" \"I'll be waiting to open the door.\" Dudley put on a foul, simpering smile. \"May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?\" \"They'll love him!\" cried Aunt Petunia rapturously. \"Excellent, Dudley,\" said Uncle Vernon. Then he rounded on Harry. \"And you?\" \"I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I'm not there,\" said Harry tonelessly. \"Exactly,\" said Uncle Vernon nastily. \"I will lead them into the lounge, introduce you, Petunia, and pour them -drinks. At eightfifteen -\" \"I'll announce dinner,\" said Aunt Petunia. \"And, Dudley, you'll say -\" \"May I take you through to the dining room, Mrs. Mason?\" said Dudley, offering his fat arm to an invisible woman. \"My perfect little gentleman!\" sniffed Aunt Petunia. \"And you?\" said Uncle Vernon viciously to Harry. 6 \"I'll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I'm not there,\" said Harry dully. \"Precisely. Now, we should aim to get in a few good compliments at dinner. Petunia, any ideas?\" \"Vernon tells me you're a wonderful golfer, Mr. Mason.... Do tell me where you bought your dress, Mrs. Mason ...... \"Perfect. . . Dudley?\" \"How about -'We had to write an essay about our hero at school, Mr. Mason, and I wrote about you.\"' This was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and hugged her son, while Harry ducked under the table so they wouldn't see him laughing. \"And you, boy?\" Harry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged. \"I'll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I'm not there,\" he said. \"Too right, you will,\" said Uncle Vernon forcefully. \"The Ma sons don't know anything about you and it's going to stay that way. When dinner's over, you take Mrs. Mason back to the lounge for coffee, Petunia, and I'll bring the subject around to drills. With any luck, I'll have the deal signed and sealed before the news at ten. be shopping for a vacation home in Majorca this time to morrow. Harry couldn't feel too excited about this. He didn't think the Dursleys would like him any better in Majorca than they did on Privet Drive. \"Right - I'm off into town to pick up the dinner jackets for Dudley and me. And you,\" he snarled at Harry. \"You stay out of your aunt's way while she's cleaning.\" Harry left through the back door. It was a brilliant, sunny day. He crossed the lawn, slumped down on the garden bench, and sang under his breath: 7 \"Happy birthday to me ... happy birthday to me. . . No cards, no presents, and he would be spending the evening pretending not to exist. He gazed miserably into the hedge. He had never felt so lonely. More than anything else at Hogwarts, more even than playing Quidditch, Harry missed his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. They, however, didn't seem to be missing him at all. Neither of them had written to him all summer, even though Ron had said he was going to ask Harry to come and stay. Countless times, Harry had been on the point of unlocking Hedwig's cage by magic and sending her to Ron and Hermione with a letter, but it wasn't worth the risk. Underage wizards weren't allowed to use magic outside of school. Harry hadn't told the Dursleys this; he knew it was only their terror that he might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped them from locking him in the cupboard under the stairs with his wand and broomstick. For the first couple of weeks back, Harry had enjoyed muttering nonsense words under his breath and watching Dudley tearing out of the room as fast as his fat legs would carry him. But the long silence from Ron and Hermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the magical world that even taunting Dudley had lost its appeal - and now Ron and Hermione had forgotten his birthday. What wouldn't he give now for a message from Hogwarts? From any witch or wizard? He'd almost be glad of a sight of his archenemy, Draco Malfoy, just to be sure it hadn't all been a dream .... Not that his whole year at Hogwarts had been fun. At the very end of last term, Harry had come face-to-face with none other than Lord Voldemort himself. Voldemort might be a ruin of his former self, but he was still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to regain power. Harry had slipped through Voldemort's clutches for a second time, but it had been a narrow escape, and even now, weeks later, Harry kept waking in the night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering where Voldemort was now, remembering his livid face, his wide, mad eyes Harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench. He had been staring absent-mindedly into the hedge - and the hedge was staring back. Two enormous green eyes had appeared among the leaves. Harry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated across the 8 lawn. \"I know what day it is,\" sang Dudley, waddling toward him. The huge eyes blinked and vanished. \"What?\" said Harry, not taking his eyes off the spot where they had been. \"I know what day it is,\" Dudley repeated, coming right up to him. \"Well done,\" said Harry. \"So you've finally learned the days of the week.\" \"Today's your birthday,\" sneered Dudley. \"How come you haven't got any cards? Haven't you even got friends at that freak place?\" \"Better not let your mum hear you talking about my school,\" said Harry coolly. Dudley hitched up his trousers, which were slipping down his fat bottom. \"Why're you staring at the hedge?\" he said suspiciously. \" I , m trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on fire,\" said Harry. Dudley stumbled backward at once, a look of panic on his fat face. \"You c-can't - Dad told you you're not to do m-magic - he said he'll chuck you out of the house - and you haven't got anywhere else to go - you haven't got any friends to take you -\" \"Jiggery pokery!\" said Harry in a fierce voice. \"Hocus pocus squiggly wiggly -\" \"MUUUUUUM!\" howled Dudley, tripping over his feet as he dashed back toward the house. \"MUUUUM! He's doing you know what!\" Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn't really 9 done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to do, with the promise he wouldn't eat again until he'd finished. While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice cream, Harry cleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed the flowerbeds, pruned and watered the roses, and repainted the garden bench. The sun blazed overhead, burning the back of his neck. Harry knew he shouldn't have risen to Dudley's bait, but Dudley had said the very thing Harry had been thinking himself... maybe he didn't have any friends at Hogwarts .... Wish they could see famous Harry Potter now, he thought savagely as he spread manure on the flower beds, his back aching, sweat running down his face. It was half past seven ,in the evening when at last, exhausted, he heard Aunt Petunia calling him. \"Get in here! And walk on the newspaper!\" Harry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen. On top of the fridge stood tonight's pudding: a huge mound of whipped cream and sugared violets. A loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven. \"Eat quickly! The Masons will be here soon!\" snapped Aunt Petunia, pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen table. She was already wearing a salmon-pink cocktail dress. Harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper. The moment he had finished, Aunt Petunia whisked away his plate. \"Upstairs! Hurry!\" As he passed the door to the living room, Harry caught a glimpse of Uncle Vernon and Dudley in bow ties and dinner jack ets. He had only just reached the upstairs landing when the door bell rang and Uncle Vernon's furious face appeared at the foot of the stairs. \"Remember, boy - one sound -\" Harry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe slipped inside, closed the door, and turned to collapse on his bed. The trouble was, there was already someone sitting on it. 10 C H-H A P T E RR T W o I DOBBY'S WARNING arry managed not to shout out, but it was a close thing. The little creature on the bed had large, bat-like ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis balls. Harry knew instantly that this was what had been watching him out of the garden hedge that morning. As they stared at each other, Harry heard Dudley's voice from the hall. \"May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?\" The creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its long, thin nose touched the carpet. Harry noticed that it was wearing what looked like an old pillowcase, with rips for arm- and leg-holes. \"Er - hello,\" said Harry nervously. \"Harry Potter!\" said the creature in a high-pitched voice Harry was sure would carry down the stairs. \"So long has Dobby wanted to meet you, sir ... Such an honor it is . . . .\" \"Th-thank you,\" said Harry, edging along the wall and sinking into his desk chair, next to Hedwig, who was asleep in her large cage. He wanted to ask, \"What are you?\" but thought it would sound too rude, so instead he said, \"Who are you?\" \"Dobby, sir. Just Dobby. Dobby the house-elf,\" said the creature. \"Oh - really?\" said Harry. \"Er - I don't want to be rude or anything, but - this isn't a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom.\" Aunt Petunias high, false laugh sounded from the living room. The elf hung his head. \"Not that I'm not pleased to meet you,\" said Harry quickly, \"but, er, is there any particular reason you're here?\" 11 \"Oh, yes, sir,\" said Dobby earnestly. \"Dobby has come to tell you, sir ... it is difficult, sir ... Dobby wonders where to begin . . . .\" \"Sit down,\" said Harry politely, pointing at the bed. To his horror, the elf burst into tears - very noisy tears. \"S-sit down!\" he wailed. \"Never ... never ever. . . \" Harry thought he heard the voices downstairs falter. \"I'm sorry,\" he whispered, \"I didn't mean to offend you or anything -\" \"Offend Dobby!\" choked the elf. \"Dobby has never been asked to sit down by a wizard - like an equal-\" Harry, trying to say \"Shh!\" and look comforting at the same time, ushered Dobby back onto the bed where he sat hiccoughing, looking like a large and very ugly doll. At last he managed to control himself, and sat with his great eyes fixed on Harry in an expression of watery adoration. \"You can't have met many decent wizards,\" said Harry, trying to cheer him up. Dobby shook his head. Then, without warning, he leapt up and started banging his head furiously on the window, shouting, \"Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!\" \"Don't - what are you doing?\" Harry hissed, springing up and pulling Dobby back onto the bed - Hedwig had woken up with a particularly loud screech and was beating her wings wildly against the bars of her cage. \"Dobby had to punish himself, sir,\" said the elf, who had gone slightly cross-eyed. \"Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir . . . .\" \"Your family?\" \"The wizard family Dobby serves, sir... DOBBY'S is a houseelf - bound to serve one house and one family forever . ..... 12 \"Do they know you're here?\" asked Harry curiously. Dobby shuddered. \"Oh, no, sir, no ... Dobby will have to punish himself most grievously for coming to see you, sir. Dobby will have to shut his ears in the oven door for this. If they ever knew, sir _\" \"But won't they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door?\" \"Dobby doubts it, sir. Dobby is always having to punish himself for something, sir. They lets Dobby get on with it, sir. Sometimes they reminds me to do extra punishments ...... \"But why don't you leave? Escape?\" \"A house-elf must be set free, sir. And the family will never set Dobby free ... Dobby will serve the family until he dies, sir . . . .\" Harry stared. \"And I thought I had it bad staying here for another four weeks,\" he said. \"This makes the Dursleys sound almost human. Can't anyone help you? Can't I?\" Almost at once, Harry wished he hadn't spoken. Dobby dissolved again into wails of gratitude. \"Please,\" Harry whispered frantically, \"please be quiet. If the Dursleys hear anything, if they know you're here -\" \"Harry Potter asks if he can help Dobby ... Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but of your goodness, Dobby never knew . ..... Harry, who was feeling distinctly hot in the face, said, \"Whatever you've heard about my greatness is a load of rubbish. I'm not even top of my year at Hogwarts; that's Hermione, she -\" But he stopped quickly, because thinking about Hermione was painful. 13 \"I-Tarry Potter is humble and modest,\" said Dobby reverently, his orblike eyes aglow. \"Harry Potter speaks not of his triumph over He-Who- Must-Not-Be-Named -\" \"Voldemort?\" said Harry. Dobby clapped his hands over his bat ears and moaned, \"Ah, speak not the name, sir! Speak not the name!\" \"Sorry\" said Harry quickly. \"I know lots of people don't like it. My friend Ron -\" He stopped again. Thinking about Ron was painful, too. Dobby leaned toward Harry, his eyes wide as headlights. 'Dobby heard tell,\" he said hoarsely, \"that Harry Potter met the Dark Lord for a second time just weeks ago ... that Harry Potter escaped Yet again. \" Harry nodded and Dobby's eyes suddenly shone with tears. ,Ah, sir,\" he gasped, dabbing his face with a corner of the grubby pillowcase he was wearing. \"Harry Potter is valiant and bold! He has braved so many dangers already! But Dobby has come to protect Harry Potter, to warn him, even if he does have to shut his ears in the oven door later... Harry Potter must notgo back to Hogwarts.\" There was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks from downstairs and the distant rumble of Uncle Vernon's voice. \"W-what?\" Harry stammered. \"But I've got to go back - term starts on September first. It's all that's keeping me going. You don't know what it's like here. I don't belong here. I belong in your world - at Hogwarts.\" \"No, no, no,\" squeaked Dobby, shaking his head so hard his ears flapped. \"Harry Potter must stay where he is safe. He is too great, too good, to lose. If Harry Potter goes back to Hogwarts, he will be in mortal danger.\" 14 \"Why?\" said Harry in surprise. \"There is a plot, Harry Potter. A plot to make most terrible things happen at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year,\" whispered Dobby, suddenly trembling all over. \"Dobby has known it for months, sir. Harry Potter must not put himself in peril. He is too important, sir!\" \"What terrible things?\" said Harry at once. \"Who's plotting them?\" Dobby made a funny choking noise and then banged his head frantically against the wall. \"All right!\" cried Harry, grabbing the elf's arm to stop him. \"You can't tell me. I understand. But why are you warning me?\" A sudden, unpleasant thought struck him. \"Hang on - this hasn't got anything to do with Vol- - sorry - with You-Know-Who, has it? You could just shake or nod,\" he added hastily as Dobby's head tilted worryingly close to the wall again. Slowly, Dobby shook his head. \"Not -not He- Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, sir =' But Dobby's eyes were wide and he seemed to be trying to give Harry a hint. Harry, however, was completely lost. \"He hasn't got a brother, has he?\" Dobby shook his head, his eyes wider than ever. \"Well then, I can't think who else would have a chance of making horrible things happen at Hogwarts,\" said Harry. \"I mean, there's Dumbledore, for one thing - you know who Dumbledore is, don't you?\" Dobby bowed his head. \"Albus Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster Hogwarts has ever had. Dobby knows it, sir. Dobby has heard Dumbledore's powers rival those of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at the height of his 15 strength. But, sir\" - Dobby's voice dropped to an urgent whisper - \"there are powers Dumbledore doesn't ... powers no decent wizard. . .\" And before Harry could stop him, Dobby bounded off the bed, seized Harry's desk lamp, and started beating himself around the head with earsplitting yelps. A sudden silence fell downstairs. Two seconds later Harry, heart thudding madly, heard Uncle Vernon coming into the hall, calling, \"Dudley must have left his television on again, the little tyke!\" \"Quick! In the closet!\" hissed Harry, stuffing Dobby in, shutting the door, and flinging himself onto the bed just as the door handle turned. \"What - the - devil - are - you - doing?\" said Uncle Vernon through gritted teeth, his face horribly close to Harry's. \"You've just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke .... One more sound and you'll wish you'd never been born, boy!\" He stomped flat-footed from the room. Shaking, Harry let Dobby out of the closet. \"See what it's like here?\" he said. \"See why I've got to go back to Hogwarts? It's the only place I've got -well, I think I've got friends. \" \"Friends who don't even write to Harry Potter?\" said Dobby slyly. \"I expect they've just been - wait a minute,\" said Harry, frowning. \"How do you know my friends haven't been writing to me?\" Dobby shuffled his feet. \"Harry Potter mustn't be angry with Dobby. Dobby did it for the best - \" \"Have you been stopping my letters?\" \"Dobby has them here, sir,\" said the elf. Stepping nimbly out of Harry's reach, he pulled a thick wad of envelopes from the inside of the pillowcase he was wearing. Harry could make out Hermione's neat 16 writing, Ron's untidy scrawl, and even a scribble that looked as though it was from the Hogwarts gamekeeper, Hagrid. Dobby blinked anxiously up at Harry. \"Harry Potter mustn't be angry... Dobby hoped ... if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him ... Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir . ..... Harry wasn't listening. He made a grab for the letters, but Dobby jumped out of reach. \"Harry Potter will have them, sir, if he gives Dobby his word that he will not return to Hogwarts. Ah, sir, this is a danger you must not face! Say you won't go back, sir!\" \"No,\" said Harry angrily. \"Give me my friends' letters!\" \"Then Harry Potter leaves Dobby no choice,\" said the elf sadly. Before Harry could move, Dobby had darted to the bedroom door, pulled it open, and sprinted down the stairs. Mouth dry, stomach lurching, Harry sprang after him, trying not to make a sound. He jumped the last six steps, landing catlike on the hall carpet, looking around for Dobby. From the dining room he heard Uncle Vernon saying, \". . . tell Petunia that very funny story about those American plumbers, Mr. Mason. She's been dying to hear. . . \" Harry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his stomach disappear. Aunt Petunia's masterpiece of a pudding, the mountain of cream and sugared violets, was floating up near the ceiling. On top of a cupboard in the corner crouched Dobby. \"No,\" croaked Harry. \"Please ... they'll kill me ...... \"Harry Potter must say he's not going back to school -\" \"Dobby ... please ... 17 \"Say it, sir -\" \"I can't -\" Dobby gave him a tragic look. \"Then Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter's own good.\" The pudding fell to the floor with a heart-stopping crash. Cream splattered the windows and walls as the dish shattered. With a crack like a whip, Dobby vanished. There were screams from the dining room and Uncle Vernon burst into the kitchen to find Harry, rigid with shock, covered from head to foot in Aunt Petunias pudding. At first, it looked as though Uncle Vernon would manage to gloss the whole thing over. (\"Just our nephew - very disturbed meeting strangers upsets him, so we kept him upstairs) He shooed the shocked Masons back into the dining room, promised Harry he would flay him to within an inch of his life when the Masons had left, and handed him a mop. Aunt Petunia dug some ice cream out of the freezer and Harry, still shaking, started scrubbing the kitchen clean. Uncle Vernon might still have been able to make his deal - if it hadn't been for the owl. Aunt Petunia was just passing around a box of after-dinner mints when a huge barn owl swooped through the dining room window, dropped a letter on Mrs. Mason's head, and swooped out again. Mrs. Mason screamed like a banshee and ran from the house shouting about lunatics. Mr. Mason stayed just long enough to tell the Dursleys that his wife was mortally afraid of birds of all shapes and sizes, and to ask whether this was their idea of a joke. Harry stood in the kitchen, clutching the mop for support, as Uncle Vernon advanced on him, a demonic glint in his tiny eyes. \"Read it!\" he hissed evilly, brandishing the letter the owl had delivered. \"Go on - read it!\" 18 Harry took it. It did not contain birthday greetings. Dear Mr. Potter, We have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was used at your place of residence this evening at twelve minutes past nine. As you know, underage wizards are not permitted to perform spells outside school, and further spellwork on your part may lead to expulsion from said school (Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery, 1875, Paragraph C). We would also ask you to remember that any magical activity that risks notice by members of the non-magical community (Muggles) is a serious offense under section 13 of the International Confederation of Warlocks' Statute of Secrecy. Enjoy your holidays! Yours sincerely, Mafalda Hopkirk IMPROPER USE OF MAGIC OFFICE Ministry of Magic Harry looked up from the letter and gulped. \"You didn't tell us you weren't allowed to use magic outside school,\" said Uncle Vernon, a mad gleam dancing in his eyes. \"For got to mention it .... Slipped your mind, I daresay ..... He was bearing down on Harry like a great bulldog, all his teeth bared. \"Well, I've got news for you, boy . ... I'm locking you up .... You're never going back to that school ... never ... and if you try and magic yourself out - they'll expel you!\" And laughing like a maniac, he dragged Harry back upstairs. Uncle Vernon was as bad as his word. The following morning, 19 he paid a man to fit bars on Harry's window. He himself fitted a catflap in the bedroom door, so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day. They let Harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening. Otherwise, he was locked in his room around the clock. Three days later, the Dursleys were showing no sign of relenting, and Harry couldn't see any way out of his situation. He lay on his bed watching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wondered miserably what was going to happen to him. What was the good of magicking himself out of his room if Hogwarts would expel him for doing it? Yet life at Privet Drive had reached an all-time low. Now that the Dursleys knew they weren't going to wake up as fruit bats, he had lost his only weapon. Dobby might have saved Harry from horrible happenings at Hogwarts, but the way things were going, he'd probably starve to death anyway. The cat-flap rattled and Aunt Petunias hand appeared, pushing a bowl of canned soup into the room. Harry, whose insides were aching with hunger, jumped off his bed and seized it. The soup was stone-cold, but he drank half of it in one gulp. Then he crossed the room to Hedwig's cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into her empty food tray. She ruffled her feathers and gave him a look of deep disgust. \"It's no good turning your beak up at it - that's all we've got,\" said Harry grimly. He put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the cat-flap and lay back down on the bed, somehow even hungrier than he had been before the soup. Supposing he was still alive in another four weeks, what would happen if he didn't turn up at Hogwarts? Would someone be sent to see why he hadn't come back? Would they be able to make the Dursleys let him go? The room was growing dark. Exhausted, stomach rumbling, mind spinning over the same unanswerable questions, Harry fell into an uneasy sleep. 20 He dreamed that he was on show in a zoo, with a card reading UNDERAGE WIZARD attached to his cage. People goggled through the bars at him as he lay, starving and weak, on a bed of straw. He saw Dobby's face in the crowd and shouted out, asking for help, but Dobby called, \"Harry Potter is safe there, sir!\" and vanished. Then the Dursleys appeared and Dudley rattled the bars of the cage, laughing at him. \"Stop it,\" Harry muttered as the rattling pounded in his sore head. \"Leave me alone ... cut it out ... I'm trying to sleep . . . .\" He opened his eyes. Moonlight was shining through the bars on the window. And someone was goggling through the bars at him: a frecklefaced, red-haired, long-nosed someone. Ron Weasley was outside Harry's window. 21 H-H A P T E RR T 11-H RR E E THE BURROW Ron.l\" breathed Harry, creeping to the window and pushing it up so they could talk through the bars. \"Ron, how did you - What the -?\" Harry's mouth fell open as the full impact of what he was seeing hit him. Ron was leaning out of the back window of an old turquoise car, which was parked in midair Grinning at Harry from the front seats were Fred and George, Ron's elder twin brothers. \"All right, Harry?\" asked George. \"What's been going on?\" said Ron. \"Why haven't you been answering my letters? I've asked you to stay about twelve times, and then Dad came home and said you'd got an official warning for using magic in front of Muggles -\" \"It wasn't me - and how did he know?\" \"He works for the Ministry,\" said Ron. \"You know we're not supposed to do spells outside school -\" \"You should talk,\" said Harry, staring at the floating car. \"Oh, this doesn't count,\" said Ron. \"We're only borrowing this. It's Dad's, we didn't enchant it. But doing magic in front of those Muggles you live with -\" \"I told you, I didn't - but it'll take too long to explain now look, can you tell them at Hogwarts that the Dursleys have locked me up and won't let me come back, and obviously I can't magic myself out, because the Ministry'Il think that's the second spell I've done in three days, so -\" \"Stop gibbering,\" said Ron. \"We've come to take you home with us.\" \"But you can't magic me out either -\" 22 \"We don't need to,\" said Ron, jerking his head toward the front seat and grinning. \"You forget who I've got with me.\" \"Tie that around the bars,\" said Fred, throwing the end of a rope to Harry. \"If the Dursleys wake up, I'm dead,\" said Harry as he tied the rope tightly around a bar and Fred revved up the car. \"Don't worry,\" said Fred, \"and stand back.\" Harry moved back into the shadows next to Hedwig, who seemed to have realized how important this was and kept still and silent. The car revved louder and louder and suddenly, with a crunching noise, the bars were pulled clean out of the window as Fred drove straight up in the air. Harry ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the ground. Panting, Ron hoisted them up into the car. Harry listened anxiously, but there was no sound from the Dursleys' bedroom. When the bars were safely in the back seat with Ron, Fred reversed as close as possible to Harry's window. \"Get in,\" Ron said. \"But all my Hogwarts stuff - my wand - my broomstick -\" \"Where is it?\" \"Locked in the cupboard under the stairs, and I can't get out of this room -\" \"No problem,\" said George from the front passenger seat. \"Out of the way, Harry.\" Fred and George climbed catlike through the window into Harry's room. You had to hand it to them, thought Harry, as George took an ordinary hairpin from his pocket and started to pick the lock. \"A lot of wizards think it's a waste of time, knowing this sort of Muggle trick,\" said Fred, \"but we feel they're skills worth learning, even if they are a bit slow.\" 23 There was a small click and the door swung open. \"So - we'll get your trunk - you grab anything you need from your room and hand it out to Ron,\" whispered George. \"Watch out for the bottom stair - it creaks,\" Harry whispered back as the twins disappeared onto the dark landing. Harry dashed around his room, collecting his things and passing them out of the window to Ron. Then he went to help Fred and George heave his trunk up the stairs. Harry heard Uncle Vernon cough. At last, panting, they reached the landing, then carried the trunk through Harry's room to the open window. Fred climbed back into the car to pull with Ron, and Harry and George pushed from the bedroom side. Inch by inch, the trunk slid through the window. Uncle Vernon coughed again. \"A bit more,\" panted Fred, who was pulling from inside the car. \"One good push -\" Harry and George threw their shoulders against the trunk and it slid out of the window into the back seat of the car. \"Okay, let's go,\" George whispered. But as Harry climbed onto the windowsill there came a sudden loud screech from behind him, followed immediately by the thunder of Uncle Vernon's voice. \"THAT RUDDY OWL!\" \"I've forgotten Hedwig!\" Harry tore back across the room as the landing light clicked on - he snatched up Hedwig's cage, dashed to the window, and passed it out to Ron. He was scrambling back onto the chest of drawers when Uncle Vernon hammered on the unlocked door and it crashed open. For a split second, Uncle Vernon stood framed in the doorway; then 24 he let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at Harry, grabbing him by the ankle. Ron, Fred, and George seized Harry's arms and pulled as hard as they could. \"Petunia!\" roared Uncle Vernon. \"He's getting away! HE'S GETTING AWAY!\" But the Weasleys gave a gigantic tug and Harry's leg slid out of Uncle Vernon's grasp - Harry was in the car - he'd slammed the door shut \"Put your foot down, Fred!\" yelled Ron, and the car shot suddenly toward the moon. Harry couldn't believe it - he was free. He rolled down the window, the night air whipping his hair, and looked back at the shrinking rooftops of Privet Drive. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley were all hanging, dumbstruck, out of Harry's window. \"See you next summer!\" Harry yelled. The Weasleys roared with laughter and Harry settled back in his seat, grinning from ear to ear. \"Let Hedwig out,\" he told Ron. \"She can fly behind us. She hasn't had a chance to stretch her wings for ages.\" George handed the hairpin to Ron and, a moment later, Hedwig soared joyfully out of the window to glide alongside them like a ghost. \"So - what's the story, Harry?\" said Ron impatiently. \"What's been happening?\" Harry told them all about Dobby, the warning he'd given Harry and the fiasco of the violet pudding. There was a long, shocked silence when he had finished. \"Very fishy,\" said Fred finally. 25 \"Definitely dodgy\" agreed George. \"So he wouldn't even tell you who's supposed to be plotting all this stuff?\" \"I don't think he could,\" said Harry. \"I told you, every time he got close to letting something slip, he started banging his head against the wall.\" He saw Fred and George look at each other. \"What, you think he was lying to me?\" said Harry. \"Well,\" said Fred, \"put it this way - house-elves have got powerful magic of their own, but they can't usually use it without their master's permission. I reckon old Dobby was sent to stop you com ing back to Hogwarts. Someone's idea of a joke. Can you think of anyone at school with a grudge against you?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry and Ron together, instantly. \"Draco Malfoy,\" Harry explained. \"He hates me.\" \"Draco Malfoy?\" said George, turning around. \"Not Lucius Malfoy's son?\" \"Must be, it's not a very common name, is it?\" said Harry. Y. \"I've heard Dad talking about him,\" said George. \"He was a big supporter of You-Know-Who.\" \"And when You-Know-Who disappeared,\" said Fred, craning around to look at Harry, \"Lucius Malfoy came back saying he'd never meant any of it. Load of dung - Dad reckons he was right in You- Know-Who's inner circle.\" Harry had heard these rumors about Malfoy's family before, and they didn't surprise him at all. Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look like a kind, thoughtful, and sensitive boy. \"I don't know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf said Harry. 26 \"Well, whoever owns him will be an old wizarding family, and they'll be rich,\" said Fred. \"Yeah, Mum's always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,\" said George. \"But all we've got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all over the garden. House-elves come with big old manors and castles and places like that; you wouldn't catch one in our house . . . .\" Harry was silent. Judging by the fact that Draco Malfoy usually had the best of everything, his family was rolling in wizard gold; he could just see Malfoy strutting around a large manor house. Sending the family servant to stop Harry from going back to Hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of thing Malfoy would do. Had Harry been stupid to take Dobby seriously? \"I'm glad we came to get you, anyway,\" said Ron. \"I was getting really worried when you didn't answer any of my letters. I thought it was Errol's fault at first -\" \"Who's Errol?\" \"Our owl. He's ancient. It wouldn't be the first time he'd collapsed on a delivery. So then I tried to borrow Hermes -\" \"Who?\" \"The owl Mum and Dad bought Percy when he was made prefect,\" said Fred from the front. \"But Percy wouldn't lend him to me,\" said Ron. \"Said he needed him.\" \"Percy's been acting very oddly this summer,\" said George, frowning. \"And he has been sending a lot of letters and spending a load of time shut up in his room .... I mean, there's only so many times you can polish a prefect badge .... You're driving too far west, Fred,\" he added, pointing at a compass on the dashboard. Fred 27 twiddled the steering wheel. \"So, does your dad know you've got the car?\" said Harry, guessing the answer. \"Er, no,\" said Ron, \"he had to work tonight. Hopefully we'll be able to get it back in the garage without Mum noticing we flew it.\" \"What does your dad do at the Ministry of Magic, anyway?\" \"He works in the most boring department,\" said Ron. \"The Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.\" \"The what?\" \"It's all to do with bewitching things that are Muggle-made, you know, in case they end up back in a Muggle shop or house. Like, last year, some old witch died and her tea set was sold to an antiques shop. This Muggle woman bought it, took it home, and tried to serve her friends tea in it. It was a nightmare - Dad was working overtime for weeks.\" \"What happened?\" \"The teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the place and one man ended up in the hospital with the sugar tongs clamped to his nose. Dad was going frantic - it's only him and an old warlock called Perkins in the office -and they had to do Memory Charms and all sorts of stuff to cover it up -\" \"But your dad - this car -\" Fred laughed. \"Yeah, Dad's crazy about everything to do with Muggles; our shed's full of Muggle stuff. He takes it apart, puts spells on it, and puts it back together again. If he raided our house he'd have to put himself under arrest. It drives Mum mad.\" \"That's the main road,\" said George, peering down through the windshield. \"We'll be there in ten minutes .... Just as well, it's getting light . . . .\" A faint pinkish glow was visible along the horizon to the east. 28 Fred brought the car lower, and Harry saw a dark patchwork of fields and clumps of trees. \"We're a little way outside the village,\" said George. \"Ottery St. Catchpole.\" Lower and lower went the flying car. The edge of a brilliant red sun was now gleaming through the trees. \"Touchdown!\" said Fred as, with a slight bump, they hit the ground. They had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard, and Harry looked out for the first time at Ron's house. It looked as though it had once been a large stone pigpen, but extra rooms had been added here and there until it was several stories high and so crooked it looked as though it were held up by magic (which, Harry reminded himself, it probably was). Four or five chimneys were perched on top of the red roof. A lopsided sign stuck in the ground near the entrance read, THE BuRRow. Around the front door lay a jumble of rubber boots and a very rusty cauldron. Several fat brown chickens were pecking their way around the yard. \"It's not much,\" said Ron. \"It's wonderful,\" said Harry happily, thinking of Privet Drive. They got out of the car. \"Now, we'll go upstairs really quietly,\" said Fred, \"and wait for Mum to call us for breakfast Then, Ron, you come bounding downstairs going, `Mum, look who turned up in the night!' and she'll be all pleased to see Harry and no one need ever know we flew the car.\" \"Right,\" said Ron. \"Come on, Harry, I sleep at the - at the top Ron had gone a nasty greenish color, his eyes fixed on the house. The other three wheeled around. Mrs. Weasley was marching across the yard, scattering chickens, and for a short, plump, kind-faced woman, it was remarkable how much she looked like a saber-toothed tiger. 29 \"Ah, \"said Fred. \"Oh, dear,\" said George. Mrs. Weasley came to a halt in front of them, her hands on her hips, staring from one guilty face to the next. She was wearing a flowered apron with a wand sticking out of the pocket. \"So, \"she said. \"Morning, Mum,\" said George, in what he clearly thought was a jaunty, winning voice. \"Have you any idea how worried I've been?\" said Mrs. Weasley in a deadly whisper. \"Sorry, Mum, but see, we had to -\" All three of Mrs. Weasley's sons were taller than she was, but they cowered as her rage broke over them. \"Beds empty! No note! Cargone - could have crashed - out of my mind with worry - did you care? - never, as long as I've lived - you wait until your father gets home, we never had trouble like this from Bill or Charlie or Percy -\" \"Perfect Percy,\" muttered Fred. \"YOU COULD DO WITH TAKING A LEAF OUT OF PERCY'S BOOK!\" yelled Mrs. Weasley, prodding a finger in Fred's chest. \"You could have died, you could have been seen, you could have lost your father his job -\" It seemed to go on for hours. Mrs. Weasley had shouted herself hoarse before she turned on Harry, who backed away. \"I'm very pleased to see you, Harry, dear,\" she said. \"Come in and have some breakfast.\" She turned and walked back into the house and Harry, after a nervous 30 glance at Ron, who nodded encouragingly, followed her. The kitchen was small and rather cramped. There was a scrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle, and Harry sat down on the edge of his seat, looking around. He had never been in a wizard house before. The clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand and no numbers at all. Written around the edge were things like Time to make tea, Time to feed the chickens, and You're late. Books were stacked three deep on the mantelpiece, books with titles like Charm Your Own Cheese, Enchantment in Baking, and One Minute Feasts - It's Magic! And unless Harry's ears were deceiving him, the old radio next to the sink had just announced that coming up was \"Witching Hour, with the popular singing sorceress, Celestina Warbeck.\" Mrs. Weasley was clattering around, cooking breakfast a little haphazardly, throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausages into the frying pan. Every now and then she muttered things like \"don't know what you were thinking of,\" and \"never would have believed it.\" \"I don't blame you, dear,\" she assured Harry, tipping eight or nine sausages onto his plate. \"Arthur and I have been worried about you, too. Just last night we were saying we'd come and get you ourselves if you hadn't written back to Ron by Friday. But really,\" (she was now adding three fried eggs to his plate) \"flying an illegal car halfway across the country - anyone could have seen you -\" She flicked her wand casually at the dishes in the sink, which began to clean themselves, clinking gently in the background. \"It was cloudy, Mum!\" said Fred. \"You keep your mouth closed while you're eating!\" Mrs. Weasley snapped. \"They were starving him, Mum!\" said George. \"And you!\" said Mrs. Weasley, but it was with a slightly softened expression that she started cutting Harry bread and buttering it for him. 31 At that moment there was a diversion in the form of a small, redheaded figure in a long nightdress, who appeared in the kitchen, gave a small squeal, and ran out again. \"Ginny,\" said Ron in an undertone to Harry. \"My sister. She's been talking about you all summer.\" \"Yeah, she'll be wanting your autograph, Harry,\" Fred said with a grin, but he caught his mother's eye and bent his face over his plate without another word. Nothing more was said until all four plates were clean, which took a surprisingly short time. \"Blimey, I'm tired,\" yawned Fred, setting down his knife and fork at last. \"I think I'll go to bed and -\" \"You will not,\" snapped Mrs. Weasley. \"It's your own fault you've been up all night. You're going to de-gnome the garden for me; they're getting completely out of hand again -\" \"Oh, Mum -\" \"And you two,\" she said, glaring at Ron and Fred. \"You can go up to bed, dear,\" she added to Harry. \"You didn't ask them to fly that wretched car -\" But Harry, who felt wide awake, said quickly, \"I'll help Ron. I've never seen a de-gnoming -\" \"That's very sweet of you, dear, but it's dull work,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"Now, let's see what Lockhart's got to say on the subject -\" And she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece. George groaned. \"Mum, we know how to de-gnome a garden -\" Harry looked at the cover of Mrs. Weasley's book. Written across it in fancy gold letters were the words Gilderoy Lockhart's Guide to Household Pests. There was a big photograph on the front of a very good- IOI)king wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes. As always in the wizarding world, the photograph was moving; the wizard, who 32 Harry supposed was Gilderoy Lockhart, kept winking cheekily up at them all. Mrs. Weasley beamed down at him. \"Oh, he is marvelous,\" she said. \"He knows his household pests, all right, it's a wonderful book . . . .\" \"Mum fancies him,\" said Fred, in a very audible whisper. \"Don't be so ridiculous, Fred,\" said Mrs. Weasley, her cheeks rather pink. \"All right, if you think you know better than Lockhart, you can go and get on with it, and woe betide you if there's a single gnome in that garden when I come out to inspect it.\" Yawning and grumbling, the Weasleys slouched outside with Harry behind them. The garden was large, and in Harry's eyes, exactlY what a garden should be. The Dursleys wouldn't have liked it - there were plenty of weeds, and the grass needed cutting but there were gnarled trees all around the walls, plants Harry had never seen spilling from every flower bed, and a big green pond full of frogs. \"Muggles have garden gnomes, too, you know,\" Harry told Ron they crossed the lawn. \"Yeah, I've seen those things they think are gnomes,\" said Ron, bent double with his head in a peony bush, \"like fat little Santa Clauses with fishing rods . . . .\" There was a violent scuffling noise, the peony bush shuddered, and Ron straightened up. \"This is a gnome,\" he said grimly. \"Gerroff me! Gerroff me!\" squealed the gnome. It was certainly nothing like Santa Claus. It was small and leathery looking, with a large, knobby, bald head exactly like a potato. Ron held it at arm's length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet; he grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down. \"This is what you have to do,\" he said. He raised the gnome above his head (\"Gerroff me!\") and started to swing it in great circles like a lasso. Seeing the shocked look on Harry's face, Ron added, \"It doesn't hurt them - you've just got to make them really dizzy so they can't find 33 their way back to the gnomeholes.\" He let go of the gnome's ankles: It flew twenty feet into the air and landed with a thud in the field over the hedge. \"Pitiful,\" said Fred. \"I bet I can get mine beyond that stump.\" Harry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes. He decided just to drop the first one he caught over the hedge, but the gnome, sensing weakness, sank its razor-sharp teeth into Harry's finger and he had a hard job shaking it off - until \"Wow, Harry - that must've been fifty feet ...... The air was soon thick with flying gnomes. \"See, they're not too bright,\" said George, seizing five or six gnomes at once. \"The moment they know the de-gnoming's going on they storm up to have a look. You'd think they'd have learned by now just to stay put.\" Soon, the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in a straggling line, their little shoulders hunched. \"They'll be back,\" said Ron as they watched the gnomes disappear into the hedge on the other side of the field. \"They love it here .... Dad's too soft with them; he thinks they're funny . . . .\" Just then, the front door slammed. \"He's back!\" said George. \"Dad's home!\" They hurried through the garden and back into the house. Mr. Weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his glasses off and his eyes closed. He was a thin man, going bald, but the little hair he had was as red as any of his children's. He was wearing long green robes, which were dusty and travel-worn. \"What a night,\" he mumbled, groping for the teapot as they all sat down around him. \"Nine raids. Nine! And old Mundungus Fletcher tried to put a hex on me when I had my back turned ...... 34 Mr. Weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed. \"Find anything, Dad?\" said Fred eagerly. \"All I got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle,\" yawned Mr. Weasley. \"There was some pretty nasty stuff that wasn't my department, though. Mortlake was taken away for questioning about some extremely odd ferrets, but that's the Committee on Experimental Charms, thank goodness ...... \"Why would anyone bother making door keys shrink?\" said George. \"Just Muggle-baiting,\" sighed Mr. Weasley. \"Sell them a key that keeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it .... Of course, it's very hard to convict anyone because no Muggle would admit their key keeps shrinking - they'll insist they just keep losing it. Bless them, they'll go to any lengths to ignore magic, even if it's staring them in the face .... But the things our lot have taken to enchanting, you wouldn't believe -\" \"LIKE CARS, FOR INSTANCE?\" Mrs. Weasley had appeared, holding a long poker like a sword. Mr. Weasley's eyes jerked open. He stared guiltily at his wife. \"C-cars, Molly, dear?\" \"Yes, Arthur, cars,\" said Mrs. Weasley, her eyes flashing. \"Imagine a wizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to do with it was take it apart to see how it worked, while really he was enchanting it to make it fly.\" Mr. Weasley blinked. \"Well, dear, I think you'll find that he would be quite within the law to do that, even if - er - he maybe would have done better to, um, tell his wife the truth .... There's a loophole in the law, you'll find .... As long as he wasn't intending to fly the car, the fact that the car could fly wouldn't -\" \"Arthur Weasley, you made sure there was a loophole when you 35 wrote that law!\" shouted Mrs. Weasley. \"Just so you could carry on tinkering with all that Muggle rubbish in your shed! And for your information, Harry arrived this morning in the car you weren't intending to fly!\" \"Harry?\" said Mr. Weasley blankly. \"Harry who?\" He looked around, saw Harry, and jumped. \"Good lord, is it Harry Potter? Very pleased to meet you, Ron's told us so much about -\" \"Your sons flew that car to Harry's house and back last night.\" shouted Mrs. Weasley. \"What have you got to say about that, eh?\" \"Did you really?\" said Mr. Weasley eagerly. \"Did it go all right? I - I mean,\" he faltered as sparks flew from Mrs. Weasley's eyes, \"that - that was very wrong, boys - very wrong indeed ...... \"Let's leave them to it,\" Ron muttered to Harry as Mrs. Weasley swelled like a bullfrog. \"Come on, I'll show you my bedroom.\" They slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to an uneven staircase, which wound its way, zigzagging up through the house. On the third landing, a door stood ajar. Harry just caught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before it closed with a snap. \"Ginny,\" said Ron. \"You don't know how weird it is for her to be this shy. She never shuts up normally -\" They climbed two more flights until they reached a door with peeling paint and a small plaque on it, saying RONALD'S ROOM. Harry stepped in, his head almost touching the sloping ceiling, and blinked. It was like walking into a furnace: Nearly everything in Ron's room seemed to be a violent shade of orange: the bedspread, the walls, even the ceiling. Then Harry realized that Ron had covered nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the same seven witches and wizards, all wearing bright orange robes, carrying 36 broomsticks, and waving energetically. \"Your Quidditch team?\" said Harry. \"The Chudley Cannons,\" said Ron, pointing at the orange bedspread, which was emblazoned with two giant black C's and a speeding cannonball. \"Ninth in the league.\" Ron's school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a corner, next to a pile of comics that all seemed to feature The Adventures of Martin Miggs, the Mad Muggle. Ron's magic wand was lying on top of a fish tank full of frog spawn on the windowsill, next to his fat gray rat, Scabbers, who was snoozing in a patch of sun. Harry stepped over a pack of Self-Shuffling playing cards on the floor and looked out of the tiny window. In the field far below he could see a gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the Weasleys' hedge. Then he turned to look at Ron, who was watching him almost nervously, as though waiting for his opinion. \"It's a bit small,\" said Ron quickly. \"Not like that room you had with the Muggles. And I'm right underneath the ghoul in the attic; he's always banging on the pipes and groaning ...... But Harry, grinning widely, said, \"This is the best house I've ever been in.\" Ron's ears went pink. . C H4 A P T E R V O U R AT F L 0 V RR 11 $ H AND BLOTTS ife at the Burrow was as different as possible from life on Privet Drive. The Dursleys liked everything neat and ordered; the Weasleys' house burst with the strange and unexpected. Harry got a shock the first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it shouted, \"Tuck your shirt in, scruffy!\" The ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet, and small explosions from Fred and George's bedroom were considered perfectly normal. What Harry found most unusual about life at Ron's, however, wasn't the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul: It was the fact that everybody there seemed to like him. 37 Mrs. Weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force him to eat fourth helpings at every meal. Mr. Weasley liked Harry to sit next to him at the dinner table so that he could bombard him with questions about life with Muggles, asking him to explain how things like plugs and the postal service worked. 42 \"Fascinating.\" he would say as Harry talked him through using a telephone. \"Ingenious, really, how many ways Muggles have found of getting along without magic.\" Harry heard from Hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after he had arrived at the Burrow. He and Ron went down to breakfast to find Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Ginny already sitting at the kitchen table. The moment she saw Harry, Ginny accidentally knocked her porridge bowl to the floor with a loud clatter. Ginny seemed very prone to knocking things over whenever Harry entered a room. She dived under the table to retrieve the bowl and emerged with her face glowing like the setting sun. Pretending he hadn't noticed this, Harry sat down and took the toast Mrs. Weasley offered him. \"Letters from school,\" said Mr. Weasley, passing Harry and Ron identical envelopes of yellowish parchment, addressed in green ink. \"Dumbledore already knows you're here, Harry - doesn't miss a trick, that man. You two've got them, too,\" he added, as Fred and George ambled in, still in their pajamas. For a few minutes there was silence as they all read their letters. Harry's told him to catch the Hogwarts Express as usual from King's Cross station on September first. There was also a list of the new books he'd need for the coming year. SECOND-YEAR STUDENTS WILL REQUIRE: The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 by Miranda Goshawk 38 Break with a Banshee by Gilderoy Lockhart Gadding with Ghouls by Gilderoy Lockhart Holidays with Hags by Gilderoy Lockhart 4 \",3 Travels with Trolls by Gilderoy Lockhart Voyages with Vampires by Gilderoy Lockhart Wanderings with Werewolves by Gilderoy Lockhart Year with the Yeti by Gilderoy Lockhart Fred, who had finished his own list, peered over at Harry's. \"You've been told to get all Lockhart's books, too!\" he said. \"The new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher must be a fan - bet it's a witch.\" At this point, Fred caught his mother's eye and quickly busied himself with the marmalade. \"That lot won't come cheap,\" said George, with a quick look at his parents. \"Lockhart's books are really expensive ...... \"Well, we'll manage,\" said Mrs. Weasley, but she looked worried. \"I expect we'll be able to pick up a lot of Ginny's things secondhand.\" \"Oh, are you starting at Hogwarts this year?\" Harry asked Ginny. She nodded, blushing to the roots of her flaming hair, and put her elbow in the butter dish. Fortunately no one saw this except Harry, because just then Ron's elder brother Percy walked in. He was already dressed, his Hogwarts prefect badge pinned to his sweater vest. \"Morning, all,\" said Percy briskly. \"Lovely day.\" He sat down in the only remaining chair but leapt up again almost immediately, pulling from underneath him a moulting, gray feather duster - at least, that was what Harry thought it was, until he saw that it was breathing. * 44 39 \"Errol!\" said Ron, taking the limp owl from Percy and extracting a letter from under its wing. \"Finally - he's got Hermione's answer. I wrote to her saying we were going to try and rescue you from the Dursleys.\" He carried Errol to a perch just inside the back door and tried to stand him on it, but Errol flopped straight off again so Ron lay him on the draining board instead, muttering, \"Pathetic.\" Then he ripped open Hermione's letter and read it out loud: \"`Dear Ron, and Harry if you're there, \"`I hope everything went all right and that Harry is okay and that you didn't do anything illegal to get him out, Ron, because that would get Harry into trouble, too. I've been really worried and if Harry is all right, will you please let me know at once, but perhaps it would be bet ter if you used a different owl because I think another delivery might finish your one off. \"'I'm very busy with schoolwork, of course'- How can she be?\" said Ron in horror. \"We're on vacation! - 'and we're going to London next Wednesday to buy my new books. Why don't we meet in Diago n Alley? \"`Let me know what's happening as soon as you can. Love from Hermione. \"' \"Well, that fits in nicely, we can go and get all your things then, too,\" said Mrs. Weasley, starting to clear the table. \"What're you all up to today?\" Harry, Ron, Fred, and George were planning to go up the hill to a small paddock the Weasleys owned. It was surrounded by trees that blocked it from view of the village below, meaning that they could practice Quidditch there, as long as they didn't fly too high. * 4$ They couldn't use real Quidditch balls, which would have been hard to explain if they had escaped and flown away over the village; instead they threw apples for one another to catch. They took turns riding Harry's Nimbus Two Thousand, which was easily the best broom; 40 Ron's old Shooting Star was often outstripped by passing butterflies. Five minutes later they were marching up the hill, broomsticks over their shoulders. They had asked Percy if he wanted to join them, but he had said he was busy. Harry had only seen Percy at mealtimes so far; he stayed shut in his room the rest of the time. \"Wish I knew what he was up to,\" said Fred, frowning. \"He's not himself. His exam results came the day before you did; twelve O.WL.s and he hardly gloated at all.\" \"Ordinary Wizarding Levels,\" George explained, seeing Harry's puzzled look. \"Bill got twelve, too. If we're not careful, we'll have another Head Boy in the family. I don't think I could stand the shame.\" Bill was the oldest Weasley brother. He and the next brother, Charlie, had already left Hogwarts. Harry had never met either of them, but knew that Charlie was in Romania studying dragons and Bill in Egypt working for the wizard's bank, Gringotts. \"Dunno how Mum and Dad are going to afford all our school stuff this year,\" said George after a while. \"Five sets of Lockhart books! And Ginny needs robes and a wand and everything ...... Harry said nothing. He felt a bit awkward. Stored in an underground vault at Gringotts in London was a small fortune that his parents had left him. Of course, it was only in the wizarding world that he had money; you couldn't use Galleons, Sickles, and Knuts 46 in Muggle shops. He had never mentioned his Gringotts bank account to the Dursleys; he didn't think their horror of anything connected with magic would stretch to a large pile of gold. Mrs. Weasley woke them all early the following Wednesday. After a quick half a dozen bacon sandwiches each, they pulled on their coats and Mrs. Weasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece and peered inside. \"We're running low, Arthur,\" she sighed. \"We'll have to buy some more today... Ah well, guests first! After you, Harry dear!\" 41 And she offered him the flowerpot. Harry stared at them all watching him. \"W-what am I supposed to do?\" he stammered. \"He's never traveled by Floo powder,\" said Ron suddenly. \"Sorry, Harry, I forgot.\" \"Never?\" said Mr. Weasley. \"But how did you get to Diagon Alley to buy your school things last year?\" \"I went on the Underground -\" \"Really?\" said Mr. Weasley eagerly. \"Were there escapators? How exactly -\" \"Not now, Arthur,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"Floo powder's a lot quicker, dear, but goodness me, if you've never used it before -\" \"He'll be all right, Mum,\" said Fred. \"Harry, watch us first.\" He took a pinch of glittering powder out of the flowerpot, stepped up to the fire, and threw the powder into the flames. With a roar, the fire turned emerald green and rose higher than Fred, who stepped right into it, shouted, \"Diagon Alley!\" and vanished. * 41 \"You must speak clearly, dear,\" Mrs. Weasley told Harry as George dipped his hand into the flowerpot. \"And be sure to get out at the right grate ...... \"The right what?\" said Harry nervously as the fire roared and whipped George out of sight, too. \"Well, there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose from, you know, but as long as you've spoken clearly -\" \"He'll be fine, Molly, don't fuss,\" said Mr. Weasley, helping himself to 42 Floo powder, too. \"But, dear, if he got lost, how would we ever explain to his aunt and uncle?\" \"They wouldn't mind,\" Harry reassured her. \"Dudley would think it was a brilliant joke if I got lost up a chimney, don't worry about that -\" \"Well ... all right ... you go after Arthur,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"Now, when you get into the fire, say where you're going \"And keep your elbows tucked in,\" Ron advised. \"And your eyes shut,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"The soot -\" \"Don't fidget,\" said Ron. \"Or you might well fall out of the wrong fireplace -\" \"But don't panic and get out too early; wait until you see Fred and George.\" Trying hard to bear all this in mind, Harry took a pinch of Floo powder and walked to the edge of the fire. He took a deep breath, scattered the powder into the flames, and stepped forward; the fire felt like a warm breeze; he opened his mouth and immediately swallowed a lot of hot ash. \"D-Dia-gon Alley,\" he coughed. 48 It felt as though he was being sucked down a giant drain. He seemed to be spinning very fast - the roaring in his ears was deafening -he tried to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him feel sick - something hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it in tightly, still spinning and spinning - now it felt as though cold hands were slapping his face - squinting through his glasses he saw a blurred stream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond - his bacon sandwiches were churning inside him - he closed his eyes again wishing it would stop, and then He fell, face forward, onto cold stone and felt the bridge of his glasses 43 snap. Dizzy and bruised, covered in soot, he got gingerly to his feet, holding his broken glasses up to his eyes. He was -,cite alone, but where he was, he had no idea. All he could tell was that he was standing in the stone fireplace of what looked like a large, dimly lit wizard's shop - but nothing in here was ever likely to be on a Hogwarts school list. A glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion, a bloodstained pack of cards, and a staring glass eye. Evil-looking masks stared down from the walls, an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter, and rusty, spiked instruments hung from the ceiling. Even worse, the dark, narrow street Harry could see through the dusty shop window was definitely not Diagon Alley. The sooner he got out of here, the better. Nose still stinging where it had hit the hearth, Harry made his way swiftly and silently toward the door, but before he'd got halfway toward it, two people appeared on the other side of the glass - and one of them was the 49 very last person Harry wanted to meet when he was lost, covered in soot, and wearing broken glasses: Draco Malfoy. Harry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to his left; he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed, leaving a small crack to peer through. Seconds later, a bell clanged, and Malfoy stepped into the shop. The man who followed could only be Draco's father. He had the same pale, pointed face and identical cold, gray eyes. Mr. Malfoy crossed the shop, looking lazily at the items on display, and rang a bell on the counter before turning to his son and saying, \"Touch nothing, Draco.\" Malfoy, who had reached for the glass eye, said, \"I thought you were going to buy me a present.\" \"I said I would buy you a racing broom,\" said his father, drumming his fingers on the counter. \"What's the good of that if I'm not on the House team?\" said Malfoy, 44 looking sulky and bad-tempered. \"Harry Potter got a Nimbus Two Thousand last year. Special permission from Dumbledore so he could play for Gryffindor. He's not even that good, it's just because he's famous ... famous for having a stupid scar on his forehead . . . .\" Malfoy bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls. \". . . everyone thinks he's so smart, wonderful Potter with his scar and his broomstick -\" \"You have told me this at least a dozen times already,\" said Mr. Malfoy, with a quelling look at his son. \"And I would remind you that it is not - prudent - to appear less than fond of Harry Potter, not when most of our kind regard him as the hero who made the Dark Lord disappear - ah, Mr. Borgin.\" 50 A stooping man had appeared behind the counter, smoothing his greasy hair back from his face. \"Mr. Malfoy, what a pleasure to see you again,\" said Mr. Borgin in a voice as oily as his hair. \"Delighted - and young Master Malfoy, too - charmed. How may I be of assistance? I must show you, just in today, and very reasonably priced -\" \"I'm not buying today, Mr. Borgin, but selling,\" said Mr. Malfoy. \"Selling?\" The smile faded slightly from Mr. Borgin's face. \"You have heard, of course, that the Ministry is conducting more raids,\" said Mr. Malfoy, taking a roll of parchment from his inside pocket and unraveling it for Mr. Borgin to read. \"I have a few - ah - items at home that might embarrass me, if the Ministry were to call ...... Mr. Borgin fixed a pair of pince-nez to his nose and looked down the list. \"The Ministry wouldn't presume to trouble you, sir, surely?\" Mr. Malfoy's lip curled. 45 \"I have not been visited yet. The name Malfoy still commands a certain respect, yet the Ministry grows ever more meddlesome. There are rumors about a new Muggle Protection Act - no doubt that fleabitten, Muggle-loving fool Arthur Weasley is behind it Harry felt a hot surge of anger. \"- and as you see, certain of these poisons might make it appear -\" \"I understand, sir, of course,\" said Mr. Borgin. \"Let me see. . .\" \"Can I have that?\" interrupted Draco, pointing at the withered hand on its cushion. 51 \"Ah, the Hand of Glory!\" said Mr. Borgin, abandoning Mr. Malfoy's list and scurrying over to Draco. \"Insert a candle and it gives light only to the holder! Best friend of thieves and plunderers! Your son has fine taste, sir.\" \"I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer, Borgin,\" said Mr. Malfoy coldly, and Mr. Borgin said quickly, \"No offense, sir, no offense meant -\" \"Though if his grades don't pick up,\" said Mr. Malfoy, more coldly still, \"that may indeed be all he is fit for -\" \"It's not my fault,\" retorted Draco. \"The teachers all have favorites, that Hermione Granger -\" \"I would have thought you'd be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam,\" snapped Mr. Malfoy. \"Ha!\" said Harry under his breath, pleased to see Draco looking both abashed and angry. \"It's the same all over,\" said Mr. Borgin, in his oily voice. \"Wizard blood is counting for less everywhere -\" \"Not with me,\" said Mr. Malfoy, his long nostrils flaring. 46 \"No, sir, nor with me, sir,\" said Mr. Borgin, with a deep bow. \"In that case, perhaps we can return to my list,\" said Mr. Malfoy shortly. \"I am in something of a hurry, Borgin, I have important business elsewhere today -\" They started to haggle. Harry watched nervously as Draco drew nearer and nearer to his hiding place, examining the objects for sale. Draco paused to examine a long coil of hangman's rope and to read, smirking, the card propped on a magnificent necklace of opals, Caution: Do Not Touch. Cursed - Has Claimed the Lives of Nineteen Muggle Owners to Date. * 52 Draco turned away and saw the cabinet right in front of him. He walked forward - he stretched out his hand for the handle \"Done,\" said Mr. Malfoy at the counter. \"Come, Draco -\" Harry wiped his forehead on his sleeve as Draco turned away. \"Good day to you, Mr. Borgin. I'll expect you at the manor tomorrow to pick up the goods.\" The moment the door had closed, Mr. Borgin dropped his oily manner. \"Good day yourself, Mister Malfoy, and if the stories are true, you haven't sold me half of what's hidden in your manor ...... Muttering darkly, Mr. Borgin disappeared into a back room. Harry waited for a minute in case he came back, then, quietly as he could, slipped out of the cabinet, past the glass cases, and out of the shop door. Clutching his broken glasses to his face, Harry stared around. He had emerged into a dingy alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely of shops devoted to the Dark Arts. The one he'd just left, Borgin and Burkes, looked like the largest, but opposite was a nasty window display of shrunken heads and, two doors down, a large cage was alive with gigantic black spiders. Two shabby-looking wizards were 47 watching him from the shadow of a doorway, muttering to each other. Feeling jumpy, Harry set off, trying to hold his glasses on straight and hoping against hope he'd be able to find a way out of here. An old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling poisonous candles told him he was in Knockturn Alley. This didn't help, as Harry had never heard of such a place. He supposed he hadn't spoken clearly enough through his mouthful of ashes back in the Weasleys' fire. Trying to stay calm, he wondered what to do. \"Not lost are you, my dear?\" said a voice in his ear, making him jump. An aged witch stood in front of him, holding a tray of what looked horribly like whole human fingernails. She leered at him, showing mossy teeth. Harry backed away. \"I'm fine, thanks,\" he said. \"I'm just -\" \"HARRY! What d'yeh think yer doin' down there?\" Harry's heart leapt. So did the witch; a load of fingernails cascaded down over her feet and she cursed as the massive form of Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, came striding toward them, beetle-black eyes flashing over his great bristling beard. \"Hagrid!\" Harry croaked in relief. \"I was lost - Floo powder -\" Hagrid seized Harry by the scruff of the neck and pulled him away from the witch, knocking the tray right out of her hands. Her shrieks followed them all the way along the twisting alleyway out into bright sunlight. Harry saw a familiar, snow-white marble building in the distance - Gringotts Bank. Hagrid had steered him right into Diagon Alley. \"Yer a mess!\" said Hagrid gruffly, brushing soot off Harry so forcefully he nearly knocked him into a barrel of dragon dung outside an apothecary. \"Skulkin' around Knockturn Alley, I dunno dodgy place, Harry - don' want no one ter see yeh down there -\" 48 \"I realized that,\" said Harry, ducking as Hagrid made to brush him off again. \"I told you, I was lost - what were you doing down there, anyway?\" * 54 \"I was lookin' fer a Flesh-Eatin' Slug Repellent,\" growled Hagrid. \"They're ruinin' the school cabbages. Yer not on yer own?\" \"I'm staying with the Weasleys but we got separated,\" Harry explained. \"I've got to go and find them . . . .\" They set off together down the street. \"How come yeh never wrote back ter me?\" said Hagrid as Harry jogged alongside him (he had to take three steps to every stride of Hagrid's enormous boots). Harry explained all about Dobby and the Dursleys. \"Lousy Muggles,\" growled Hagrid. \"If I'd've known -\" \"Harry! Harry! Over here!\" Harry looked up and saw Hermione Granger standing at the top of the white flight of steps to Gringotts. She ran down to meet them, her bushy brown hair flying behind her. \"What happened to your glasses? Hello, Hagrid - Oh, it's wonderful to see you two again - Are you coming into Gringotts, Harry?\" \"As soon as I've found the Weasleys,\" said Harry. \"Yeh won't have long ter wait,\" Hagrid said with a grin. Harry and Hermione looked around: Sprinting up the crowded street were Ron, Fred, George, Percy, and Mr. Weasley. \"Harry,\" Mr. Weasley panted. \"We hoped you'd only gone one grate too far . He mopped his glistening bald patch. \"Molly's 49 frantic - she's coming now -\" \"Where did you come out?\" Ron asked. \"Knockturn Alley,\" said Hagrid grimly. \"Excellent.\" said Fred and George together. \"We've never been allowed in,\" said Ron enviously. *55* \"I should ruddy well think not,\" growled Hagrid. Mrs. Weasley now came galloping into view, her handbag swing ing wildly in one hand, Ginny just clinging onto the other. \"Oh, Harry - oh, my dear - you could have been any where -\" Gasping for breath she pulled a large clothes brush out of her bag and began sweeping off the soot Hagrid hadn't managed to beat away. Mr. Weasley took Harry's glasses, gave them a tap of his wand, and returned them, good as new. \"Well, gotta be off,\" said Hagrid, who was having his hand wrung by Mrs. Weasley (\"Knockturn Alley! If you hadn't found him, Hagrid!\"). \"See yer at Hogwarts!\" And he strode away, head and shoulders taller than anyone else in the packed street. \"Guess who I saw in Borgin and Burkes?\" Harry asked Ron and Hermione as they climbed the Gringotts steps. \"Malfoy and his fa ther.\" \"Did Lucius Malfoy buy anything?\" said Mr. Weasley sharply behind them. \"No, he was selling =' \"So he's worried,\" said Mr. Weasley with grim satisfaction. \"Oh, I'd love to get Lucius Malfoy for something ...... \"You be careful, Arthur,\" said Mrs. Weasley sharply as they were bowed into the bank by a goblin at the door. \"That family's trou ble. Don't go biting off more than you can chew -\" \"So you don't think I'm a match for Lucius Malfoy?\" said Mr. Weasley indignantly, but he was distracted almost at once by the sight of Hermione's parents, who were standing nervously at the counter that ran all along the great marble hall, waiting for Hermione to introduce them. 50 ,5 s \"But you're Muggles!\" said Mr. Weasley delightedly. \"We must have a drink! What's that you've got there? Oh, you're changing Muggle money. Molly, look!\" He pointed excitedly at the tenpound notes in Mr. Granger's hand. \"Meet you back here,\" Ron said to Hermione as the Weasleys and Harry were led off to their underground vaults by another Gringotts goblin. The vaults were reached by means of small, goblin-driven carts that sped along miniature train tracks through the bank's underground tunnels. Harry enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the Weasleys' vault, but felt dreadful, far worse than he had in Knockturn Alley, when it was opened. There was a very small pile of silver Sickles inside, and just one gold Galleon. Mrs. Weasley felt right into the corners before sweeping the whole lot into her bag. Harry felt even worse when they reached his vault. He tried to block the contents from view as he hastily shoved handfuls of coins into a leather bag. Back outside on the marble steps, they all separated. Percy muttered vaguely about needing a new quill. Fred and George had spotted their friend from Hogwarts, Lee Jordan. Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were going to a secondhand robe shop. Mr. Weasley was insisting on taking the Grangers off to the Leaky Cauldron for a drink. \"We'll all meet at Flourish and Blotts in an hour to buy your schoolbooks,\" said Mrs. Weasley, setting off with Ginny. \"And not one step down Knockturn Alley!\" she shouted at the twins' retreating backs. Harry, Ron, and Hermione strolled off along the winding, cobbled street. The bag of gold, silver, and bronze jangling cheerfully *57* in Harry's pocket was clamoring to be spent, so he bought three large strawberry-and-peanut-butter ice creams, which they slurped happily as they wandered up the alley, examining the fascinating shop windows. Ron gazed longingly at a full set of Chudley Can non robes in the windows of Quality Quidditch Supplies until Hermione dragged them off to buy ink and parchment next door. In Gambol and Japes Wizarding Joke Shop, they met Fred, George, and Lee Jordan, who were stocking up on Dr. Filibuster's Fabulous 51 Wet-Start, No-Heat Fireworks, and in a tiny junk shop full of bro ken wands, lopsided brass scales, and old cloaks covered in potion stains they found Percy, deeply immersed in a small and deeply boring book called Prefects Who Gained Power. `A study of Hogwarts prefects and their later careers, \" Ron read aloud off the back cover. \"That sounds fascinating . . . .\" \"Go away,\" Percy snapped. \"'Course, he's very ambitious, Percy, he's got it all planned out .... He wants to be Minister of Magic. . . \" Ron told Harry and Hermione in an undertone as they left Percy to it. An hour later, they headed for Flourish and Blotts. They were by no means the only ones making their way to the bookshop. As they approached it, they saw to their surprise a large crowd jostling out side the doors, trying to get in. The reason for this was proclaimed by a large banner stretched across the upper windows: GILDEROY LOCKHART will be signing copies of his autobiography MAGICAL ME today 12:30 P.m. to 4:30 P.m. \"We can actually meet him!\" Hermione squealed. \"I mean, he's written almost the whole booklist!\" The crowd seemed to be made up mostly of witches around Mrs. Weasley's age. A harrassed-looking wizard stood at the door, saying, \"Calmly, please, ladies .... Don't push, there ... mind the books, now . . . . \" Harry, Ron, and Hermione squeezed inside. A long line wound right to the back of the shop, where Gilderoy Lockhart was signing his books. They each grabbed a copy of The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 and sneaked up the line to where the rest of the Weasleys were standing with Mr. and Mrs. Granger. \"Oh, there you are, good,\" said Mrs. Weasley. She sounded breathless and kept patting her hair. \"We'll be able to see him in a minute ...... Gilderoy Lockhart came slowly into view, seated at a table surrounded by large pictures of his own face, all winking and flashing dazzlingly 52 white teeth at the crowd. The real Lockhart was wearing robes of forget-me-not blue that exactly matched his eyes; his pointed wizard's hat was set at a jaunty angle on his wavy hair. A short, irritable-looking man was dancing around taking photographs with a large black camera that emitted puffs of purple smoke with every blinding flash. \"Out of the way, there,\" he snarled at Ron, moving back to get a better shot. \"This is for the Daily Prophet -\" \"Big deal,\" said Ron, rubbing his foot where the photographer had stepped on it. Gilderoy Lockhart heard him. He looked up. He saw Ron *59* and then he saw Harry. He stared. Then he leapt to his feet and positively shouted, \"It can't be Harry Potter?\" The crowd parted, whispering excitedly; Lockhart dived forward, seized Harry's arm, and pulled him to the front. The crowd burst into applause. Harry's face burned as Lockhart shook his hand for the photographer, who was clicking away madly, wafting thick smoke over the Weasleys. \"Nice big smile, Harry,\" said Lockhart, through his own gleaming teeth. \"Together, you and I are worth the front page.\" When he finally let go of Harry's hand, Harry could hardly feel his fingers. He tried to sidle back over to the Weasleys, but Lockhart threw an arm around his shoulders and clamped him tightly to his side. \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he said loudly, waving for quiet. \"What an extraordinary moment this is! The perfect moment for me to make a little announcement I've been sitting on for some time! \"When young Harry here stepped into Flourish and Blotts today, he only wanted to buy my autobiography -which I shall be happy to present him now, free of charge-\" The crowd applauded again. \"He had no idea,\" Lockhart continued, giving Harry a little shake that made his glasses slip to 53 the end of his nose, \"that he would shortly be getting much, much more than my book, Magical Me. He and his schoolmates will, in fact, be getting the real magical me. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I have great pleasure and pride in announcing that this September, I will be taking up the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!\" The crowd cheered and clapped and Harry found himself being 60 presented with the entire works of Gilderoy Lockhart. Staggering slightly under their weight, he managed to make his way out of the limelight to the edge of the room, where Ginny was standing next to her new cauldron. \"You have these,\" Harry mumbled to her, tipping the books into the cauldron. \"I'll buy my own -\" \"Bet you loved that, didn't you, Potter?\" said a voice Harry had no trouble recognizing. He straightened up and found himself face-to-face with Draco Malfoy, who was wearing his usual sneer. \"Famous Harry Potter,\" said Malfoy. \"Can't even go into a bookshop without making the front page.\" \"Leave him alone, he didn't want all that!\" said Ginny. It was the first time she had spoken in front of Harry. She was glaring at Malfoy. \"Potter, you've got yourself a girlfriend!\" drawled Malfoy. Ginny went scarlet as Ron and Hermione fought their way over, both clutching stacks of Lockhart's books. \"Oh, it's you,\" said Ron, looking at Malfoy as if he were something unpleasant on the sole of his shoe. \"Bet you're surprised to see Harry here, eh?\" \"Not as surprised as I am to see you in a shop, Weasley,\" retorted Malfoy. \"I suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for all those.\" Ron went as red as Ginny. He dropped his books into the cauldron, 54 too, and started toward Malfoy, but Harry and Hermione grabbed the back of his jacket. \"Ron!\" said Mr. Weasley, struggling over with Fred and George. \"What are you doing? It's too crowded in here, let's go outside.\" 61 \"Well, well, well - Arthur Weasley.\" It was Mr. Malfoy. He stood with his hand on Draco's shoulder, sneering in just the same way. \"Lucius,\" said Mr. Weasley, nodding coldly. \"Busy time at the Ministry, I hear,\" said Mr. Malfoy. \"All those raids ... I hope they're paying you overtime?\" He reached into Ginny's cauldron and extracted, from amid the glossy Lockhart books, a very old, very battered copy of A Beginner's Guide to Transfiguration. \"Obviously not,\" Mr. Malfoy said. \"Dear me, what's the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don't even pay you well for it?\" Mr. Weasley flushed darker than either Ron or Ginny. \"We have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy,\" he said. \"Clearly,\" said Mr. Malfoy, his pale eyes straying to Mr. and Mrs. Granger, who were watching apprehensively. \"The company you keep, Weasley ... and I thought your family could sink no lower =' There was a thud of metal as Ginny's cauldron went flying; Mr. Weasley had thrown himself at Mr. Malfoy, knocking him backward into a bookshelf. Dozens of heavy spellbooks came thundering down on all their heads; there was a yell of, \"Get him, Dad!\" from Fred or George; Mrs. Weasley was shrieking, \"No, Arthur, no!\"; the crowd stampeded backward, knocking more shelves over; \"Gentlemen, please - please!\" cried the assistant, and then, louder than all 55 \"Break it up, there, gents, break it up -\" 62 Hagrid was wading toward them through the sea of books. In an instant he had pulled Mr. Weasley and Mr. Malfoy apart. Mr. Weasley had a cut lip and Mr. Malfoy had been hit in the eye by an Encyclopedia of Toadstools. He was still holding Ginny's old Transfiguration book. He thrust it at her, his eyes glittering with malice. \"Here, girl - take your book - it's the best your father can give you -\" Pulling himself out of Hagrid's grip he beckoned to Draco and swept from the shop. \"Yeh should've ignored him, Arthur,\" said Hagrid, almost lifting Mr. Weasley off his feet as he straightened his robes. \"Rotten ter the core, the whole family, everyone knows that - no Malfoy's worth listenin' ter - bad blood, that's what it is - come on now - let's get outta here.\" The assistant looked as though he wanted to stop them leaving, but he barely came up to Hagrid's waist and seemed to think better of it. They hurried up the street, the Grangers shaking with fright and Mrs. Weasley beside herself with fury. \"A fine example to set for your children . . . brawling in public . . . what Gilderoy Lockhart must've thought -\" \"He was pleased,\" said Fred. \"Didn't you hear him as we were leaving? He was asking that bloke from the Daily Prophet if he'd be able to work the fight into his report - said it was all publicity -\" But it was a subdued group that headed back to the fireside in the Leaky Cauldron, where Harry, the Weasleys, and all their shopping would be traveling back to the Burrow using Floo powder. They said good-bye to the Grangers, who were leaving the pub for the Muggle street on the other side; Mr. Weasley started to ask 63 them how bus stops worked, but stopped quickly at the look on Mrs. Weasley's face. Harry took off his glasses and put them safely in his pocket before 56 helping himself to Floo powder. It definitely wasn't his favorite way to travel. C H-H A P T E RR F I v E THE WHOMPING WILLOW he end of the summer vacation came too quickly for Harry's liking. He was looking forward to getting back to Hogwarts, but his month at the Burrow had been the happiest of his life. It was difficult not to feel jealous of Ron when he thought of the Dursleys and the sort of welcome he could expect next time he turned up on Privet Drive. On their last evening, Mrs. Weasley conjured up a sumptuous dinner that included all of Harry's favorite things, ending with a mouthwatering treacle pudding. Fred and George rounded off the evening with a display of Filibuster fireworks; they fiIled the kitchen with red and blue stars that bounced from ceiling to wall for at least half an hour. Then it was time for a last mug of hot chocolate and bed. It took a long while to get started next morning. They were up at dawn, but somehow they still seemed to have a great deal to do. 65 Mrs. Weasley dashed about in a bad mood looking for spare socks and quills; people kept colliding on the stairs, half-dressed with bits of toast in their hands; and Mr. Weasley nearly broke his neck, tripping over a stray chicken as he crossed the yard carrying Ginny's trunk to the car. Harry couldn't see how eight people, six large trunks, two owls, and a rat were going to fit into one small Ford Anglia. He had reckoned, of course, without the special features that Mr. Weasley had added. \"Not a word to Molly,\" he whispered to Harry as he opened the. trunk and showed him how it had been magically expanded so that the luggage fitted easily. 57 When at last they were all in the car, Mrs. Weasley glanced into the back seat, where Harry, Ron, Fred, George, and Percy were all sitting comfortably side by side, and said, \"Muggles do know more than we give them credit for, don't they?\" She and Ginny got into the front seat, which had been stretched so that it resembled a park bench. \"I mean, you'd never know it was this roomy from the outside, would you?\" Mr. Weasley started up the engine and they trundled out of the yard, Harry turning back for a last look at the house. He barely had time to wonder when he'd see it again when they were back George had forgotten his box of Filibuster fireworks. Five minutes after that, they skidded to a halt in the yard so that Fred could run in for his broomstick. They had almost reached the highway when Ginny shrieked that she'd left her diary. By the time she had clambered back into the car, they were running very late, and tempers were running high. * 66 Mr. Weasley glanced at his watch and then at his wife. \"Molly, dear -\" \"No, Arthur -\" \"No one would see - this little button here is an Invisibility Booster I installed - that'd get us up in the air - then we fly above the clouds. We'd be there in ten minutes and no one would be any the wiser -\" \"I said no, Arthur, not in broad daylight -\" They reached King's Cross at a quarter to eleven. Mr. Weasley dashed across the road to get trolleys for their trunks and they all hurried into the station. Harry had caught the Hogwarts Express the previous year. The tricky part was getting onto platform nine and three-quarters, which wasn't visible to the Muggle eye. What you had to do was walk through the solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten. It didn't hurt, but it had to be done carefully so that none of the Muggles noticed you vanishing. \"Percy first,\" said Mrs. Weasley, looking nervously at the clock 58 overhead, which showed they had only five minutes to disappear casually through the barrier. Percy strode briskly forward and vanished. Mr. Weasley went next; Fred and George followed. \"I'll take Ginny and you two come right after us,\" Mrs. Weasley told Harry and Ron, grabbing Ginny's hand and setting off. In the blink of an eye they were gone. \"Let's go together, we've only got a minute,\" Ron said to Harry. Harry made sure that Hedwig's cage was safely wedged on top of his trunk and wheeled his trolley around to face the barrier. He felt 61 perfectly confident; this wasn't nearly as uncomfortable as using Floo powder. Both of them bent low over the handles of their trolleys and walked purposefully toward the barrier, gathering speed. A few feet away from it, they broke into a run and CRASH. Both trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward; Ron's trunk fell off with a loud thump, Harry was knocked off his feet, and Hedwig's cage bounced onto the shiny floor, and she rolled away, shrieking indignantly; people all around them stared and a guard nearby yelled, \"What in blazes d'you think you're doing?\" \"Lost control of the trolley,\" Harry gasped, clutching his ribs as he got up. Ron ran to pick up Hedwig, who was causing such a scene that there was a lot of muttering about cruelty to animals from the surrounding crowd. \"Why can't we get through?\" Harry hissed to Ron. \"I dunno -\" Ron looked wildly around. A dozen curious people were still watching them. 59 \"We're going to miss the train,\" Ron whispered. \"I don't understand why the gateway's sealed itself -\" Harry looked up at the giant clock with a sickening feeling in the pit of his stomach. Ten seconds ... nine seconds ... He wheeled his trolley forward cautiously until it was right against the barrier and pushed with all his might. The metal remained solid. Three seconds . . . two seconds ... one second ... \"It's gone,\" said Ron, sounding stunned. \"The train's left. What if Mum and Dad can't get back through to us? Have you got any Muggle money?\" 68 And they marched off through the crowd of curious Muggles, out of the station and back onto the side road where the old Ford Anglia was parked. Ron unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of taps from his wand. They heaved their luggage back in, put Hedwig on the back seat, and got into the front. \"Check that no one's watching,\" said Ron, starting the ignition with another tap of his wand. Harry stuck his head out of the window: Traffic was rumbling along the main road ahead, but their street was empty. \"Okay,\" he said. Ron pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard. The car around them vanished - and so did they. Harry could feel the seat vibrating beneath him, hear the engine, feel his hands on his knees and his glasses on his nose, but for all he could see, he had become a pair of eyeballs, floating a few feet above the ground in a dingy street full of parked cars. \"Let's go,\" said Ron's voice from his right. And the ground and the dirty buildings on either side fell away, 60 dropping out of sight as the car rose; in seconds, the whole of London lay, smoky and glittering, below them. Then there was a popping noise and the car, Harry, and Ron reappeared. \"Uh-oh,\" said Ron, jabbing at the Invisibility Booster. \"It's faulty -\" Both of them pummeled it. The car vanished. Then it flickered back again. \"Hold on!\" Ron yelled, and he slammed his foot on the acceler * 7 0 ator; they shot straight into the low, woolly clouds and everything turned dull and foggy. \"Now what?\" said Harry, blinking at the solid mass of cloud pressing in on them from all sides. \"We need to see the train to know what direction to go in,\" said Ron. \"Dip back down again - quickly -\" They dropped back beneath the clouds and twisted around in their seats, squinting at the ground. \"I can see it!\" Harry yelled. \"Right ahead - there!\" The Hogwarts Express was streaking along below them like a scarlet snake. \"Due north,\" said Ron, checking the compass on the dashboard. \"Okay, we'll just have to check on it every half hour or so - hold on And they shot up through the clouds. A minute later, they burst out into a blaze of sunlight. It was a different world. The wheels of the car skimmed the sea of fluffy cloud, the sky a bright, endless blue under the blinding white sun. 61 \"All we've got to worry about now are airplanes,\" said Ron. They looked at each other and started to laugh; for a long time, they couldn't stop. It was as though they had been plunged into a fabulous dream. This, thought Harry, was surely the only way to travel - past swirls and turrets of snowy cloud, in a car full of hot, bright sunlight, with a fat pack of toffees in the glove compartment, and the prospect of seeing Fred's and George's jealous faces when they * 71 landed smoothly and spectacularly on the sweeping lawn in front of Hogwarts castle. They made regular checks on the train as they flew farther and farther north, each dip beneath the clouds showing them a different view. London was soon far behind them, replaced by neat green fields that gave way in turn to wide, purplish moors, a great city alive with cars like multicolored ants, villages with tiny toy churches. Several uneventful hours later, however, Harry had to admit that some of the fun was wearing off. The toffees had made them extremely thirsty and they had nothing to drink. He and Ron had pulled off their sweaters, but Harry's T-shirt was sticking to the back of his seat and his glasses kept sliding down to the end of his sweaty nose. He had stopped noticing the fantastic cloud shapes now and was thinking longingly of the train miles below, where you could buy ice-cold pumpkin juice from a trolley pushed by a plump witch. Why hadn't they been able to get onto platform nine and three-quarters? \"Can't be much further, can it?\" croaked Ron, hours later still, as the sun started to sink into their floor of cloud, staining it a deep pink. \"Ready for another check on the train?\" It was still right below them, winding its way past a snowcapped mountain. It was much darker beneath the canopy of clouds. Ron put his foot on the accelerator and drove them upward again, but as he did so, the engine began to whine. 62 Harry and Ron exchanged nervous glances. \"It's probably just tired,\" said Ron. \"It's never been this far before ...... 12 And they both pretended not to notice the whining growing louder and louder as the sky became steadily darker. Stars were blossoming in the blackness. Harry pulled his sweater back on, try ing to ignore the way the windshield wipers were now waving fee bly, as though in protest. \"Not far,\" said Ron, more to the car than to Harry, \"not far now,\" and he patted the dashboard nervously. When they flew back beneath the clouds a little while later, they had to squint through the darkness for a landmark they knew. \"There!\" Harry shouted, making Ron and Hedwig jump. \"Straight ahead!\" Silhouetted on the dark horizon, high on the cliff over the lake, stood the many turrets and towers of Hogwarts castle. But the car had begun to shudder and was losing speed. \"Come on,\" Ron said cajolingly, giving the steering wheel a lit tle shake, \"nearly there, come on -\" The engine groaned. Narrow jets of steam were issuing from un der the hood. Harry found himself gripping the edges of his seat very hard as they flew toward the lake. The car gave a nasty wobble. Glancing out of his window, Harry saw the smooth, black, glassy surface of the water, a mile below. Ron's knuckles were white on the steering wheel. The car wobbled again. \"Come on,\" Ron muttered. They were over the lake - the castle was right ahead - Ron put his foot down. There was a loud clunk, a splutter, and the engine died com pletely. \"Uh-oh,\" said Ron, into the silence. The nose of the car dropped. They were falling, gathering speed, heading straight for the solid castle wall. \"Noooooo!\" Ron yelled, swinging the steering wheel around; they 63 missed the dark stone wall by inches as the car turned in a great arc, soaring over the dark greenhouses, then the vegetable patch, and then out over the black lawns, losing altitude all the time. Ron let go of the steering wheel completely and pulled his wand out of his back pocket \"STOP! STOP!\" he yelled, whacking the dashboard and the windshield, but they were still plummeting, the ground flying up toward them \"WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREE!\" Harry bellowed, lunging for the steering wheel, but too late CRUNCH. With an earsplitting bang of metal on wood, they hit the thick tree trunk and dropped to the ground with a heavy jolt. Steam was billowing from under the crumpled hood; Hedwig was shrieking in terror; a golfball-size lump was throbbing on Harry's head where he had hit the windshield; and to his right, Ron let out a low, despairing groan. \"Are you okay?\" Harry said urgently. \"My wand,\" said Ron, in a shaky voice. \"Look at my wand -\" It had snapped, almost in two; the tip was dangling limply, held on by a few splinters. Harry opened his mouth to say he was sure they'd be able to mend it up at the school, but he never even got started. At that very moment, something hit his side of the car with the force of a * Y4 * charging bull, sending him lurching sideways into Ron, just as an equally heavy blow hit the roof. \"What's happen -?\" Ron gasped, staring through the windshield, and Harry looked around 64 just in time to see a branch as thick as a python smash into it. The tree they had hit was attacking them. Its trunk was bent almost double, and its gnarled boughs were pummeling every inch of the car it could reach. \"Aaargh!\" said Ron as another twisted limb punched a large dent into his door; the windshield was now trembling under a hail of blows from knuckle-like twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram was pounding furiously on the roof, which seemed to be caving \"Run for it!\" Ron shouted, throwing his full weight against his door, but next second he had been knocked backward into Harry's lap by a vicious uppercut from another branch. \"We're done for!\" he moaned as the ceiling sagged, but suddenly the floor of the car was vibrating - the engine had restarted. \"Reverse!\" Harry yelled, and the car shot backward; the tree was still trying to hit them; they could hear its roots creaking as it almost ripped itself up, lashing out at them as they sped out of reach. \"That,\" panted Ron, \"was close. Well done, car -\" The car, however, had reached the end of its tether. With two sharp clunks, the doors flew open and Harry felt his seat tip sideways: Next thing he knew he was sprawled on the damp ground. Loud thuds told him that the car was ejecting their luggage from the trunk; Hedwig's cage flew through the air and burst open; she rose out of it with an angry screech and sped off toward the castle Y5 without a backward look. Then, dented, scratched, and steaming, the car rumbled off into the darkness, its rear lights blazing angrily. \"Come back!\" Ron yelled after it, brandishing his broken wand. \"Dad'll kill me!\" But the car disappeared from view with one last snort from its exhaust. \"Can you believe our luck?\" said Ron miserably, bending down to 65 pick up Scabbers. \"Of all the trees we could've hit, we had to get one that hits back.\" He glanced over his shoulder at the ancient tree, which was still flailing its branches threateningly. \"Come on,\" said Harry wearily, \"we'd better get up to the school ...... It wasn't at all the triumphant arrival they had pictured. Stiff, cold, and bruised, they seized the ends of their trunks and began dragging them up the grassy slope, toward the great oak front doors. \"I think the feast's already started,\" said Ron, dropping his trunk at the foot of the front steps and crossing quietly to look through a brightly lit window. \"Hey - Harry - come and look - it's the Sorting!\" Harry hurried over and, together, he and Ron peered in at the Great Hall. Innumerable candles were hovering in midair over four long, crowded tables, making the golden plates and goblets sparkle. Overhead, the bewitched ceiling, which always mirrored the sky outside, sparkled with stars. Through the forest of pointed black Hogwarts hats, Harry saw a long line of scared-looking first years fiIing into the Hall. Ginny * 76 was among them, easily visible because of her vivid Weasley ha-ir. Meanwhile, Professor McGonagall, a bespectacled witch with her hair in a tight bun, was placing the famous Hogwarts Sorting Hat on a stool before the newcomers. Every year, this aged old hat, patched, frayed, and dirty, sorted new students into the four Hogwarts houses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin). Harry well remembered putting it on, exactly one year ago, and waiting, petrified, for its decision as it muttered aloud in his ear. For a few horrible seconds he had feared that the hat was going to put him in Slytherin, the house that had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than any other -but he had 66 ended up in Gryffindor, along with Ron, Hermione, and the rest of the Weasleys. Last term, Harry and Ron had helped Gryffindor win the House Championship, beating Slytherin for the first time in seven years. A very small, mousy-haired boy had been called forward to place the hat on his head. Harry's eyes wandered past him to where Professor Dumbledore, the headmaster, sat watching the Sorting from the staff table, his long silver beard and half-moon glasses shining brightly in the candlelight. Several seats along, Harry saw Gilderoy Lockhart, dressed in robes of aquamarine. And there at the end was Hagrid, huge and hairy, drinking deeply from his goblet. \"Hang on. . . \" Harry muttered to Ron. \"There's an empty chair at the staff table .... Where's Snape?\" Professor Severus Snape was Harry's least favorite teacher. Harry also happened to be Snape's least favorite student. Cruel, sarcastic, and disliked by everybody except the students from his own house (Slytherin), Snape taught Potions. \"Maybe he's ill!\" said Ron hopefully. \"Maybe he's left,\" said Ha-rry, \"because he missed out on the Defense Against Dark Arts job again!\" \"Or he might have been sacked!\" said Ron enthusiastically. \"I mean, everyone hates him -\" \"Or maybe,\" said a very cold voice right behind them, \"he's waiting to hear why you two didn't arrive on the school train.\" Harry spun around. There, his black robes rippling in a cold breeze, stood Severus Snape. He was a thin man with sallow skin, a hooked nose, and greasy, shoulder-length black hair, and at this moment, he was smiling in a way that told Harry he and Ron were in very deep trouble. \"Follow me,\" said Snape. Not daring even to look at each other, Harry and Ron followed Snape up the steps into the vast, echoing entrance hall, which was lit with 67 flaming torches. A delicious smell of food was wafting from the Great Hall, but Snape led them away from the warmth and light, down a narrow stone staircase that led into the dungeons. \"In!\" he said, opening a door halfway down the cold passageway and pointing. They entered Snape's office, shivering. The shadowy walls were lined with shelves of large glass) ars, in which floated all manner of revolting things Harry didn't really want to know the name of at the moment. The fireplace was dark and empty. Snape closed the door and turned to look at them. \"So,\" he said softly, \"the train isn't good enough for the famous Harry Potter and his faithful sidekick Weasley. Wanted to arrive with a bang, did we, boys?\" \"No, sir, it was the barrier at King's Cross, it -\" 78 \"Silence!\" said Snape coldly. \"What have you done with the car?\" Ron gulped. This wasn't the first time Snape had given Harry the impression of being able to read minds. But a moment later, he un derstood, as Snape unrolled today's issue of the Evening Prophet. \"You were seen,\" he hissed, showing them the headline: FLY ING FORD ANGLIA MYSTIFIES MUGGLES. He began to read aloud: \"Two Muggles in London, convinced they saw an old car flying over the Post Office tower ... at noon in Norfolk, Mrs. Hetty Bayliss, while hanging out her washing ... Mr. Angus Fleet, of Peebles, reported to police ... Six or seven Muggles in all. I be lieve your father works in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office?\" he said, looking up at Ron and smiling still more nastily. \"Dear, dear ... his own son. . . \" Harry felt as though he'd just been walloped in the stomach by one of the mad tree's larger branches. If anyone found out Mr. Weasley had bewitched the car ... he hadn't thought of that .... \"I noticed, in my search of the park, that considerable damage seems to have been done to a very valuable Whomping Willow,\" Snape went on. \"That tree did more damage to us than we -\" Ron blurted out. 68 \"Silence!\" snapped Snape again. \"Most unfortunately, you are not in my House and the decision to expel you does not rest with me. I shall go and fetch the people who do have that happy power. You will wait here.\" Harry and Ron stared at each other, white-faced. Harry didn't feel hungry any more. He now felt extremely sick. He tried not to look at a large, slimy something suspended in green liquid on a shelf behind Snape's desk. If Snape had gone to fetch Professor McGonagall, head of Gryffindor House, they were hardly any better off. She might be fairer than Snape, but she was still extremely strict. Ten minutes later, Snape returned, and sure enough it was Professor McGonagall who accompanied him. Harry had seen Professor McGonagall angry on several occasions, but either he had forgotten just how thin her mouth could go, or he had never seen her this angry before. She raised her wand the moment she entered; Harry and Ron both flinched, but she merely pointed it at the empty fireplace, where flames suddenly erupted. \"Sit,\" she said, and they both backed into chairs by the fire. \"Explain,\" she said, her glasses glinting ominously. Ron launched into the story, starting with the barrier at the station refusing to let them through. \" -so we had no choice, Professor, we couldn't get on the train.\" \"Why didn't you send us a letter by owl? I believe you have an owl?\" Professor McGonagall said coldly to Harry. Harry gaped at her. Now she said it, that seemed the obvious thing to have done. \"I - I didn't think -\" \"That,\" said Professor McGonagall, \"is obvious.\" There was a knock on the office door and Snape, now looking happier 69 than ever, opened it. There stood the headmaster, Professor Dumbledore. Harry's whole body went numb. Dumbledore was looking unusually grave. He stared down his very crooked nose at them, and *80* Harry suddenly found himself wishing he and Ron were still being beaten up by the Whomping Willow. There was a long silence. Then Dumbledore said, \"Please explain why you did this.\" It would have been better if he had shouted. Harry hated the disappointment in his voice. For some reason, he was unable to look Dumbledore in the eyes, and spoke instead to his knees. He told Dumbledore everything except that Mr. Weasley owned the bewitched car, making it sound as though he and Ron had happened to find a flying car parked outside the station. He knew Dumbledore would see through this at once, but Dumbledore asked no questions about the car. When Harry had finished, he merely continued to peer at them through his spectacles. \"We'll go and get our stuff,\" said Ron in a hopeless sort of voice. \"What are you talking about, Weasley?\" barked Professor McGonagall. \"Well, you're expelling us, aren't you?\" said Ron. Harry looked quickly at Dumbledore. \"Not today, Mr. Weasley,\" said Dumbledore. \"But I must impress upon both of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be writing to both your families tonight. I must also warn you that if you do anything like this again, I will have no choice but to expel you.\" Snape looked as though Christmas had been canceled. He cleared his throat and said, \"Professor Dumbledore, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry, caused serious damage to an old and valuable tree - surely acts of this nature -\" 70 * 8i \"It will be for Professor McGonagall to decide on these boys' punishments, Severus,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"They are in her House and are therefore her responsibility.\" He turned to Professor McGonagall. \"I must go back to the feast, Minerva, I've got to give out a few notices. Come, Severus, there's a delicious-looking cus tard tart I want to sample -\" Snape shot a look of pure venom at Harry and Ron as he allowed himself to be swept out of his office, leaving them alone with Pro fessor McGonagall, who was still eyeing them like a wrathful eagle. \"You'd better get along to the hospital wing, Weasley, you're bleeding.\" \"Not much,\" said Ron, hastily wiping the cut over his eye with his sleeve. \"Professor, I wanted to watch my sister being Sorted -\" \"The Sorting Ceremony is over,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Your sister is also in Gryffindor.\" \"Oh, good,\" said Ron. \"And speaking of Gryffindor -\" Professor McGonagall said sharply, but Harry cut in: \"Professor, when we took the car, term hadn't started, so - so Gryffindor shouldn't really have points taken from it - should it?\" he finished, watching her anxiously. Professor McGonagall gave him a piercing look, but he was sure she had almost smiled. Her mouth looked less thin, anyway. \"I will not take any points from Gryffindor,\" she said, and Harry's heart lightened considerably. \"But you will both get a de tention.\" It was better than Harry had expected. As for Dumbledore's writing to the Dursleys, that was nothing. Harry knew perfectly well they'd just be disappointed that the Whomping Willow hadn't squashed him flat. 82 Professor McGonagall raised her wand again and pointed it at Snape's desk. A large plate of sandwiches, two silver goblets, and a jug of-iced pumpkin juice appeared with a pop. \"You will eat in here and then go straight up to your dormitory,\" she said. \"I must also return to the feast.\" 71 When the door had closed behind her, Ron let out a long, low whistle. \"I thought we'd had it,\" he said, grabbing a sandwich. \"So did I,\" said Harry, taking one, too. \"Can you believe our luck, though?\" said Ron thickly through a mouthful of chicken and ham. \"Fred and George must've flown that car five or six times and no Muggle ever saw them.\" He swallowed and took another huge bite. \"Why couldn't we get through the barrier?\" Harry shrugged. \"We'll have to watch our step from now on, though,\" he said, taking a grateful swig of pumpkin juice. \"Wish we could've gone up to the feast ...... \"She didn't want us showing off,\" said Ron sagely. \"Doesn't want people to think it's clever, arriving by flying car.\" When they had eaten as many sandwiches as they could (the plate kept refilling itself) they rose and left the office, treading the familiar path to Gryffindor Tower. The castle was quiet; it seemed that the feast was over. They walked past muttering portraits and creaking suits of armor, and climbed narrow flights of stone stairs, until at last they reached the passage where the secret entrance to Gryffindor Tower was hidden, behind an oil painting of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress. \"Password?\" she said as they approached. \"Er -\" said Harry. They didn't know the new year's password, not having met a Gryffindor prefect yet, but help came almost immediately; they heard hurrying feet behind them and turned to see Hermione dashing toward them. \"There you are! Where have you been? The most ridiculous rumors - someone said you'd been expelled for crashing a flying car \"Well, we haven't been expelled,\" Harry assured her. \"You're not telling me you did fly here?\" said Hermione, sounding 72 almost as severe as Professor McGonagall. \"Skip the lecture,\" said Ron impatiently, \"and tell us the new password.\" \"It's `wattlebird,\"' said Hermione impatiently, \"but that's not the point - \" Her words were cut short, however, as the portrait of the fat lady swung open and there was a sudden storm of clapping. It looked as though the whole of Gryffindor House was still awake, packed into the circular common room, standing on the lopsided tables and squashy armchairs, waiting for them to arrive. Arms reached through the portrait hole to pull Harry and Ron inside, leaving Hermione to scramble in after then-t. \"Brilliant!\" yelled Lee Jordan. \"Inspired! What an entrance! Flying a car right into the Whomping Willow, people'll be talking about that one for years -\" \"Good for you,\" said a fifth year Harry had never spoken to; someone was patting him on the back as though he'd just won a marathon; Fred and George pushed their way to the front of the crowd and said together, \"Why couldn't we've come in the car, eh?\" 84 Ron was scarlet in the face, grinning embarrassedly, but Harry could see one person who didn't look happy at all. Percy was visible over the heads of some excited first years, and he seemed to be trying to get near enough to start telling them off. Harry nudged Ron in the ribs and nodded in Percy's direction. Ron got the point at once. \"Got to get upstairs - bit tired,\" he said, and the two of them started pushing their way toward the door on the other side of the room, which led to a spiral staircase and the dormitories. \"'Night,\" Harry called back to Hermione, who was wearing a scowl just like Percy's. They managed to get to the other side of the common room, still having their backs slapped, and gained the peace of the staircase. 73 They hurried up it, right to the top, and at last reached the door of their old dormitory, which now had a sign on it saying SECOND YEARS. They entered the familiar, circular room, with its five four-posters hung with red velvet and its high, narrow windows. Their trunks had been brought up for them and stood at the ends of their beds. Ron grinned guiltily at Harry. \"I know I shouldn't've enjoyed that or anything, but =' The dormitory door flew open and in came the other second year Gryffindor boys, Seamus Finnigan, Dean Thomas, and Neville Longbottom. \"Unbelievable!\" beamed Seamus. \"Cool,\" said Dean. \"Amazing,\" said Neville, awestruck. Harry couldn't help it. He grinned, too. * 85 * H-H A P T E RR s 1 x GILDEROY LOCKHART he next day, however, Harry barely grinned once. Things started to go downhill from breakfast in the Great Hall. The four long house tables were laden with tureens of porridge, plates of kippers, mountains of toast, and dishes of eggs and bacon, beneath the enchanted ceiling (today, a dull, cloudy gray). Harry and Ron sat down at the Gryffindor table next to Hermione, who had her copy of Voyages with Vampires propped open against a milk jug. There was a slight stiffness in the way she said \"Morning,\" which told Harry that she was still disapproving of the way they had arrived. Neville Longbottom, on the other hand, greeted them cheerfully. Neville was a round-faced and accident-prone boy with the worst memory of anyone Harry had ever met. \"Mail's due any minute - I think Gran's sending a few things I forgot.\" 74 Harry had only just started his porridge when, sure enough, there was a rushing sound overhead and a hundred or so owls 86 streamed in, circling the hall and dropping letters and packages into the chattering crowd. A big, lumpy package bounced off Neville's head and, a second later, something large and gray fell into Hermione's jug, spraying them all with milk and feathers. \"Enrol!\" said Ron, pulling the bedraggled owl out by the feet. Errol slumped, unconscious, onto the table, his legs in the air and a damp red envelope in his beak. \"Oh, no -\" Ron gasped. \"It's all right, he's still alive,\" said Hermione, prodding Errol gently with the tip of her finger. \"It's not that - it's that.\" Ron was pointing at the red envelope. It looked quite ordinary to Harry, but Ron and Neville were both looking at it as though they expected it to explode. \"What's the matter?\" said Harry. \"She's - she's sent me a Howler,\" said Ron faintly. \"You'd better open it, Ron,\" said Neville in a timid whisper. \"It'll be worse if you don't My gran sent me one once, and I ignored it and\" - he gulped - \"it was horrible.\" Harry looked from their petrified faces to the red envelope. \"What's a Howler?\" he said. But Ron's whole attention was fixed on the letter, which had begun to smoke at the corners. 75 \"Open it,\" Neville urged. \"It'll all be over in a few minutes -\" Ron stretched out a shaking hand, eased the envelope from Errol's beak, and slit it open. Neville stuffed his fingers in his ears. A split second later, Harry knew why. He thought for a moment it had exploded; a roar of sound fiIled the huge hall, shaking dust from the ceiling. 8 _ \"- E CAR, I WO ULDN'T HAVE BEEN S URSTEALING THE PRISED IF THEY'D EXPELLED YOU, YOU WAIT TILL I GET HOLD OF YOU, I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU STOPPED TO THINK WHAT YOUR FATHERAND I WENT THROUGH WHEN WE SAW IT WAS GONE -\" Mrs. Weasleys yells, a hundred times louder than usual, made the plates and spoons rattle on the table, and echoed deafeningly off the stone walls. People throughout the hall were swiveling around to see who had received the Howler, and Ron sank so low in his chair that only his crimson forehead could be seen. \"- LETTER FROM DUMBLEDORE LAST NIGHT, I THOUGHT YOUR FATHER WOULD DIE OF SHAME, WE DIDN'T BRING YOU UP TO BEHAVE LIKE THIS, YOU AND HARRY COULD BOTH HAVE DIED -\" Harry had been wondering when his name was going to crop up. He tried very hard to look as though he couldn't hear the voice that was making his eardrums throb. \"-ABSOLUTELYDISGUSTED - YOUR FATHER'S FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK, IT'S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT AND IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE WE'LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT BACK HOME.\" A ringing silence fell. The red envelope, which had dropped from Ron's hand, burst into flames and curled into ashes. Harry and Ron sat 76 stunned, as though a tidal wave had just passed over them. A few people laughed and, gradually, a babble of talk broke out again. Hermione closed Voyages with Vampires and looked down at the top of Ron's head. * 88 \"Well, I don't know what you expected, Ron, but you -\" \"Don't tell me I deserved it,\" snapped Ron. Harry pushed his porridge away. His insides were burning with guilt. Mr. Weasley was facing an inquiry at work. After all Mr. and Mrs. Weasley had done for him over the summer ... But he had no time to dwell on this; Professor McGonagall was moving along the Gryffindor table, handing out course schedules. Harry took his and saw that they had double Herbology with the Hufepuffs first. Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together, crossed the vegetable patch, and made for the greenhouses, where the magical plants were kept. At least the Howler had done one good thing: Hermione seemed to think they had now been punished enough and was being perfectly friendly again. As they neared the greenhouses they saw the rest of the class standing outside, waiting for Professor Sprout. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had only just joined them when she came striding into view across the lawn, accompanied by Gilderoy Lockhart. Professor Sprout's arms were full of bandages, and with another twinge of guilt, Harry spotted the Whomping Willow in the distance, several of its branches now in slings. Professor Sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat over her flyaway hair; there was usually a large amount of earth on her clothes and her fingernails would have made Aunt Petunia faint. Gilderoy Lockhart, however, was immaculate in sweeping robes of turquoise, his golden hair shining under a perfectly positioned turquoise hat with gold trimming. 77 \"Oh, hello there!\" he called, beaming around at the assembled 89 students. \"Just been showing Professor Sprout the right way to doctor a Whomping Willow! But I don't want you running away with the idea that I'm better at Herbology than she is! I just happen to have met several of these exotic plants on my travels . . .\" \"Greenhouse three today, chaps!\" said Professor Sprout, who was looking distinctly disgruntled, not at all her usual cheerful self. There was a murmur of interest. They had only ever worked in greenhouse one before - greenhouse three housed far more interesting and dangerous plants. Professor Sprout took a large key from her belt and unlocked the door. Harry caught a whiff of damp earth and fertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant, umbrellasized flowers dangling from the ceiling. He was about to follow Ron and Hermione inside when Lockhart's hand shot out. \"Harry! I've been wanting a word - you don't mind if he's a couple of minutes late, do you, Professor Sprout?\" Judging by Professor Sprout's scowl, she did mind, but Lockhart said, \"That's the ticket,\" and closed the greenhouse door in her face. \"Harry,\" said Lockhart, his large white teeth gleaming in the sunlight as he shook his head. \"Harry, Harry, Harry.\" Completely nonplussed, Harry said nothing. \"When I heard -well, of course, it was all my fault. Could have kicked myself.\" Harry had no idea what he was talking about. He was about to say so when Lockhart went on, \"Don't know when I've been more shocked. Flying a car to Hogwarts! Well, of course, I knew at once why you'd done it. Stood out a mile. Harry, Harry, Harry.\" It was remarkable how he could show every one of those brilliant teeth even when he wasn't talking. 78 90 \"Gave you a taste for publicity, didn't I?\" said Lockhart. \"Gave you the bug. You got onto the front page of the paper with me and you couldn't wait to do it again.\" \"Oh, no, Professor, see -\" \"Harry, Harry, Harry,\" said Lockhart, reaching out and grasping his shoulder. \"I understand. Natural to want a bit more once you've had that first taste - and I blame myself for giving you that, be cause it was bound to go to your head - but see here, young man, you can't start flying cars to try and get yourself noticed. Just calm down, all right? Plenty of time for all that when you're older. Yes, yes, I know what you're thinking! 'It's all right for him, he's an in ternationally famous wizard already!' But when I was twelve, I was just as much of a nobody as you are now. In fact, Id say I was even more of a nobody! I mean, a few people have heard of you, haven't they? All that business with He-\\\"o-Must-Not-Be-Named!\" He glanced at the lightning scar on Harry's forehead. \"I know, I know - it's not quite as good as winning Witch Weekly's Most Charming-Smile Award five times in a row, as I have - but it's a start, Harry, it's a start.\" He gave Harry a hearty wink and strode off. Harry stood stunned for a few seconds, then, remembering he was supposed to be in the greenhouse, he opened the door and slid inside. Professor Sprout was standing behind a trestle bench in the cen ter of the greenhouse. About twenty pairs of different-colored ear muffs were lying on the bench. When Harry had taken his place between Ron and Hermione, she said, \"We'll be repotting Man drakes today. Now, who can tell me the properties of the Man drake?\" To nobody's surprise, Hermione's hand was first into the air. s1 \"Mandrake, or Mandragora, is a powerful restorative,\" said Hermione, sounding as usual as though she had swallowed the textbook. \"It is used to return people who have been transfigured or cursed to their original state.\" \"Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor,\" said Professor Sprout. \"The Mandrake forms an essential part of most antidotes. It is also, however, dangerous. Who can tell me why?\" 79 Hermione's hand narrowly missed Harry's glasses as it shot up again. \"The cry of the Mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it,\" she said promptly. \"Precisely. Take another ten points,\" said Professor Sprout. \"Now, the Mandrakes we have here are still very young.\" She pointed to a row of deep trays as she spoke, and everyone shuffled forward for a better look. A hundred or so tufty little plants, purplish green in color, were growing there in rows. They looked quite unremarkable to Harry, who didn't have the slightest idea what Hermione meant by the \"cry\" of the Mandrake. \"Everyone take a pair of earmuffs,\" said Professor Sprout. There was a scramble as everyone tried to seize a pair that wasn't pink and fluffy. \"When I tell you to put them on, make sure your ears are completely covered,\" said Professor Sprout. \"When it is safe to remove them, I will give you the thumbs-up. Right - earmuffs on.\" Harry snapped the earmuffs over his ears. They shut out sound completely. Professor Sprout put the pink, fluffy pair over her own ears, rolled up the sleeves of her robes, grasped one of the tufty plants firmly, and pulled hard. *92* Harry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hear. Instead of roots, a small, muddy, and extremely ugly baby popped out of the earth. The leaves were growing right out of his head. He had pale green, mottled skin, and was clearly bawling at the top of his lungs. Professor Sprout took a large plant pot from under the table and plunged the Mandrake into it, burying him in dark, damp compost until only the tufted leaves were visible. Professor Sprout dusted off her hands, gave them all the thumbs-up, and removed her own earmuffs. 80 \"As our Mandrakes are only seedlings, their cries won't kill yet,\" she said calmly as though she'd just done nothing more exciting than water a begonia. \"However, they will knock you out for several hours, and as I'm sure none of you want to miss your first day back, make sure your earmuffs are securely in place while you work. I will attract your attention when it is time to pack up. \"Four to a tray - there is a large supply of pots here - compost in the sacks over there - and be careful of the Venemous Tentacula, it's teething.\" She gave a sharp slap to a spiky, dark red plant as she spoke, making it draw in the long feelers that had been inching sneakily over her shoulder. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were joined at their tray by a curly-haired Hufflepuff boy Harry knew by sight but had never spoken to. \"Justin Finch-Fletchley,\" he said brightly, shaking Harry by the hand. \"Know who you are, of course, the famous Harry Potter... And you're Hermione Granger - always top in everything\" * 9% (Hermione beamed as she had her hand shaken too) \"- and Ron Weasley. Wasn't that your flying car?\" Ron didn't smile. The Howler was obviously still on his mind. \"That Lockhart's something, isn't he?\" said Justin happily as they began fiIling their plant pots with dragon dung compost. \"Awfully brave chap. Have you read his books? Id have died of fear if Id been cornered in a telephone booth by a werewolf, but he stayed cool and - zap - just fantastic. \"My name was down for Eton, you know. I can't tell you how glad I am I came here instead. Of course, Mother was slightly disappointed, but since I made her read Lockhart's books I think she's begun to see how useful it'll be to have a fully trained wizard in the family . . . .\" After that they didn't have much chance to talk. Their earmuffs were 81 back on and they needed to concentrate on the Mandrakes. Professor Sprout had made it look extremely easy, but it wasn't. The Mandrakes didn't like coming out of the earth, but didn't seem to want to go back into it either. They squirmed, kicked, flailed their sharp little fists, and gnashed their teeth; Harry spent ten whole minutes trying to squash a particularly fat one into a pot. By the end of the class, Harry, like everyone else, was sweaty, aching, and covered in earth. Everyone traipsed back to the castle for a quick wash and then the Gryffindors hurried off to Transfiguration. Professor McGonagall's classes were always hard work, but today was especially difficult. Everything Harry had learned last year seemed to have leaked out of his head during the summer. He was supposed to be turning a beetle into a button, but all he managed * 94 to do was give his beetle a lot of exercise as it scuttled over the desktop avoiding his wand. Ron was having far worse problems. He had patched up his wand with some borrowed Spellotape, but it seemed to be damaged beyond repair. It kept crackling and sparking at odd moments, and every time Ron tried to transfigure his beetle it engulfed him in thick gray smoke that smelled of rotten eggs. Unable to see what he was doing, Ron accidentally squashed his beetle with his elbow and had to ask for a new one. Professor McGonagall wasn't pleased. Harry was relieved to hear the lunch bell. His brain felt like a wrung sponge. Everyone fiIed out of the classroom except him and Ron, who was whacking his wand furiously on the desk. \"Stupid - useless - thing -\" \"Write home for another one,\" Harry suggested as the wand let off a volley of bangs like a firecracker. \"Oh, yeah, and get another Howler back,\" said Ron, stuffing the now hissing wand into his bag. \" `It's your own fault your wand got snapped - '\" 82 They went down to lunch, where Ron's mood was not improved by Hermione's showing them the handful of perfect coat buttons she had produced in Transfiguration. \"What've we got this afternoon?\" said Harry, hastily changing the subject. \"Defense Against the Dark Arts,\" said Hermione at once. \"Why, \"demanded Ron, seizing her schedule, \"have you outlined all Lockhart's lessons in little hearts?\" Hermione snatched the schedule back, blushing furiously. * 95 * They finished lunch and went outside into the overcast courtyard. Hermione sat down on a stone step and buried her nose in Voyages with Vampires again. Harry and Ron stood talking about Quidditch for several minutes before Harry became aware that he was being closely watched. Looking up, he saw the very small, mousy-haired boy he'd seen trying on the Sorting Hat last night staring at Harry as though transfixed. He was clutching what looked like an ordinary Muggle camera, and the moment Harry looked at him, he went bright red. \"All right, Harry? I'm -I'm Colin Creevey,\" he said breathlessly, taking a tentative step forward. \"I'm in Gryffindor, too. D'you think - would it be all right if - can I have a picture?\" he said, raising the camera hopefully. \"A picture?\" Harry repeated blankly. \"So I can prove I've met you,\" said Colin Creevey eagerly, edging further forward. \"I know all about you. Everyone's told me. About how you survived when You-Know-Who tried to kill you and how he disappeared and everything and how you've still got a lightning scar on your forehead\" (his eyes raked Harry's hairline) \"and a boy in my dormitory said if I develop the film in the right potion, the pictures'll move.\" Colin drew a great shuddering breath of excitement and said, \"It's amazing here, isn't it? I never knew all the odd stuff I could do was magic till I got the letter from Hogwarts. My dad's a milkman, he couldn't believe it either. So I'm taking loads of pictures to send home 83 to him. And it'd be really good if I had one of you\" - he looked imploringly at Harry - \"maybe your friend could take it and I could stand next to you? And then, could you sign it?\" 96 \"Signed photos? You're giving out signed photos, Potter?\" Loud and scathing, Draco Malfoy's voice echoed around the courtyard. He had stopped right behind Colin, flanked, as he always was at Hogwarts, by his large and thuggish cronies, Crabbe and Goyle. \"Everyone line up!\" Malfoy roared to the crowd. \"Harry Potter's giving out signed photos!\" \"No, I'm not,\" said Harry angrily, his fists clenching. \"Shut up, Malfoy.\" \"You're just jealous,\" piped up Colin, whose entire body was about as thick as Crabbe's neck. `jealous?\"said Malfoy, who didn't need to shout anymore: half the courtyard was listening in. \"Of what? I don't want a foul scar right across my head, thanks. I don't think getting your head cut open makes you that special, myself.\" Crabbe and Goyle were sniggering stupidly. \"Eat slugs, Malfoy,\" said Ron angrily. Crabbe stopped laughing and started rubbing his knuckles in a menacing way. \"Be careful, Weasley,\" sneered Malfoy. \"You don't want to start any trouble or your Mommy'll have to come and take you away from school.\" He put on a shrill, piercing voice. \"Ifyou put another toe out of line' - \" A knot of Slytherin fifth-years nearby laughed loudly at this. \"Weasley would like a signed photo, Potter,\" smirked Malfoy. \"It'd be worth more than his family's whole house -\" 84 Ron whipped out his Spellotaped wand, but Hermione shut Voyages with Vampires with a snap and whispered, \"Look out!\" \"What's all this, what's all this?\" Gilderoy Lockhart was striding * 97 toward them, his turquoise robes swirling behind him. \"Who's giv ing out signed photos?\" Harry started to speak but he was cut short as Lockhart flung an arm around his shoulders and thundered jovially, \"Shouldn't have asked! We meet again, Harry!\" Pinned to Lockhart's side and burning with humiliation, Harry saw Malfoy slide smirking back into the crowd. \"Come on then, Mr. Creevey,\" said Lockhart, beaming at Colin. \"A double portrait, can't do better than that, and we'll both sign it for you.\" Colin fumbled for his camera and took the picture as the bell rang behind them, signaling the start of afternoon classes. \"Off you go, move along there,\" Lockhart called to the crowd, and he set off back to the castle with Harry, who was wishing he knew a good Vanishing Spell, still clasped to his side. \"A word to the wise, Harry,\" said Lockhart paternally as they entered the building through a side door. \"I covered up for you back there with young Creevey - if he was photographing me, too, your schoolmates won't think you're setting yourself up so much . . . .\" Deaf to Harry's stammers, Lockhart swept him down a corridor lined with staring students and up a staircase. \"Let me just say that handing out signed pictures at this stage of your career isn't sensible - looks a tad bigheaded, Harry, to be frank. There may well come a time when, like me, you'll need to keep a stack handy wherever you go, but\" - he gave a little chor tle - \"I don't think you're quite there yet.\" They had reached Lockhart's classroom and he let Harry go at 98 last. Harry yanked his robes straight and headed for a seat at the very back of the class, where he busied himself with piling all seven of Lockhart's books in front of him, so that he could avoid looking at the real thing. 85 The rest of the class came clattering in, and Ron and Hermione sat down on either side of Harry. \"You could've fried an egg on your face\" said Ron. \"You'd better hope Creevey doesn't meet Ginny, or they'll be starting a Harry Potter fan club.\" \"Shut up,\" snapped Harry. The last thing he needed was for Lockhart to hear the phrase \"Harry Potter fan club.\" When the whole class was seated, Lockhart cleared his throat loudly and silence fell. He reached forward, picked up Neville Longbottom's copy of Travels with Trolls, and held it up to show his own, winking portrait on the front. \"Me,\" he said, pointing at it and winking as well. \"Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-time winner of Witch Weekly's Most- Charming-Smile Award - but I don't talk about that. I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at her!\" He waited for them to laugh; a few people smiled weakly. \"I see you've all bought a complete set of my books -well done. I thought we'd start today with a little quiz. Nothing to worry about just to check how well you've read them, how much you've taken in -\" When he had handed out the test papers he returned to the front of the class and said, \"You have thirty minutes - start - now!\" Harry looked down at his paper and read: 1. What is Gilderoy Lockhart 's favorite color? 2. What is Gilderoy Lockhart's secret ambition? 3. What, in your opinion, is Gilderoy Lockhart's greatest achievement to date? 86 On and on it went, over three sides of paper, right down to: 54. When is Gilderoy Lockhart's birthday, and what would his ideal gift be? Half an hour later, Lockhart collected the papers and rifled through them in front of the class. \"Tut, tut - hardly any of you remembered that my favorite color is lilac. I say so in Year with the Yeti. And a few of you need to read Wanderings with Werewolves more carefully - I clearly state in chapter twelve that my ideal birthday gift would be harmony between all magic and non-magic peoples - though I wouldn't say no to a large bottle of Ogdeds Old Firewhisky!\" He gave them another roguish wink. Ron was now staring at Lockhart with an expression of disbelief on his face; Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, who were sitting in front, were shaking with silent laughter. Hermione, on the other hand, was listening to Lockhart with rapt attention and gave a start when he mentioned her name. \". . . but Miss Hermione Granger knew my secret ambition is to rid the world of evil and market my own range of hair-care potions - good girl! In fact\" - he flipped her paper over - \"full marks! Where is Miss Hermione Granger?\" *100* Hermione raised a trembling hand. \"Excellent!\" beamed Lockhart. \"Quite excellent! Take ten points for Gryffindor! And so - to business -\" He bent down behind his desk and lifted a large, covered cage onto it. \"Now - be warned! It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind! You may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here. All I ask is that you remain calm.\" In spite of himself, Harry leaned around his pile of books for a better 87 look at the cage. Lockhart placed a hand on the cover. Dean and Seamus had stopped laughing now. Neville was cowering in his front row seat. \"I must ask you not to scream,\" said Lockhart in a low voice. \"It might provoke them.\" As the whole class held its breath, Lockhart whipped off the cover. \"Yes,\" he said dramatically. \"Freshly caught Cornish pixies. \" Seamus Finnigan couldn't control himself. He let out a snort of laughter that even Lockhart couldn't mistake for a scream of terror. \"Yes?\" He smiled at Seamus. \"Well, they're not - they're not very - dangerous, are they?\" Seamus choked. \"Don't be so sure!\" said Lockhart, waggling a finger annoyingly at Seamus. \"Devilish tricky little blighters they can be!\" The pixies were electric blue and about eight inches high, with pointed faces and voices so shrill it was like listening to a lot of budgies arguing. The moment the cover had been removed, they *101* had started jabbering and rocketing around, rattling the bars and making bizarre faces at the people nearest them. \"Right, then,\" Lockhart said loudly. \"Let's see what you make of them!\" And he opened the cage. It was pandemonium. The pixies shot in every direction like rockets. Two of them seized Neville by the ears and lifted him into the air. Several shot straight through the window, showering the back row with broken glass. The rest proceeded to wreck the classroom more effectively than a rampaging rhino. They grabbed ink bottles and sprayed the class with them, shredded books and papers, tore pictures from the walls, up-ended the waste basket, grabbed bags and books and threw them out of the smashed window; within minutes, half the 88 class was sheltering under desks and Neville was swinging from the iron chandelier in the ceiling. \"Come on now - round them up, round them up, they're only pixies,\" Lockhart shouted. He rolled up his sleeves, brandished his wand, and bellowed, \"Peskipiksi Pesternomi!\" It had absolutely no effect; one of the pixies seized his wand and threw it out of the window, too. Lockhart gulped and dived under his own desk, narrowly avoiding being squashed by Neville, who fell a second later as the chandelier gave way. The bell rang and there was a mad rush toward the exit. In the relative calm that followed, Lockhart straightened up, caught sight of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, who were almost at the door, and said, \"Well, I'll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage.\" He swept past them and shut the door quickly behind him. *102* \"Can you believe him?\" roared Ron as one of the remaining pixies bit him painfully on the ear. \"He just wants to give us some hands-on experience,\" said Hermione, immobilizing two pixies at once with a clever Freezing Charm and stuffing them back into their cage. \"Hands on? \"said Harry, who was trying to grab a pixie dancing out of reach with its tongue out. \"Hermione, he didn't have a clue what he was doing -\" \"Rubbish,\" said Hermione. \"You've read his books - look at all those amazing things he's done -\" \"He says he's done,\" Ron muttered. arry spent a lot of time over the next few days dodging out of sight whenever he saw Gilderoy Lockhart coming down a corridor. Harder 89 to avoid was Colin Creevey, who seemed to have memorized Harry's schedule. Nothing seemed to give Colin a bigger thrill than to say, \"All right, Harry?\" six or seven times a day and hear, \"Hello, Colin,\" back, however exasperated Harry sounded when he said it. Hedwig was still angry with Harry about the disasterous car journey and Ron's wand was still malfunctioning, surpassing itself on Friday morning by shooting out of Ron's hand in Charms and hitting tiny old Professor Flitwick squarely between the eyes, creating a large, throbbing green boil where it had struck. So with one thing and another, Harry was quite glad to reach the weekend. He, Ron, and Hermione were planning to visit Hagrid on Saturday morning. Harry, however, was shaken awake several hours earlier *104* than he would have liked by Oliver Wood, Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team. \"Whassamatter?\" said Harry groggily. \"Quidditch practice!\" said Wood. \"Come on!\" Harry squinted at the window. There was a thin mist hanging across the pink-and-gold sky. Now that he was awake, he couldn't understand how he could have slept through the racket the birds were making. \"Oliver,\" Harry croaked. \"It's the crack of dawn.\" \"Exactly,\" said Wood. He was a tall and burly sixth year and, at the moment, his eyes were gleaming with a crazed enthusiasm. \"It's part of our new training program. Come on, grab your broom, and let's go,\" said Wood heartily. \"None of the other teams have started training yet; we're going to be first off the mark this year -\" Yawning and shivering slightly, Harry climbed out of bed and tried to find his Quidditch robes. \"Good man,\" said Wood. \"Meet you on the field in fifteen minutes. 90 When he'd found his scarlet team robes and pulled on his cloak for warmth, Harry scribbled a note to Ron explaining where he'd gone and went down the spiral staircase to the common room, his Nimbus Two Thousand on his shoulder. He had just reached the portrait hole when there was a clatter behind him and Colin Creevey came dashing down the spiral staircase, his camera swinging madly around his neck and something clutched in his hand. \"I heard someone saying your name on the stairs, Harry! Look what I've got here! I've had it developed, I wanted to show you -\" *105* Harry looked bemusedly at the photograph Colin was brandishing under his nose. A moving, black-and-white Lockhart was tugging hard on an arm Harry recognized as his own. He was pleased to see that his photographic self was putting up a good fight and refusing to be dragged into view. As Harry watched, Lockhart gave up and slumped, panting, against the white edge of the picture. \"Will you sign it?\" said Colin eagerly. \"No,\" said Harry flatly, glancing around to check that the room was really deserted. \"Sorry, Colin, I'm in a hurry - Quidditch practice -\" He climbed through the portrait hole. \"Oh, wow! Wait for me! I've never watched a Quidditch game before!\" Colin scrambled through the hole after him. \"It'll be really boring,\" Harry said quickly, but Colin ignored him, his face shining with excitement. \"You were the youngest House player in a hundred years, weren't you, Harry? Weren't you?\" said Colin, trotting alongside him. \"You must be brilliant. I've never flown. Is it easy? Is that your own broom? Is that the best one there is?\" 91 Harry didn't know how to get rid of him. It was like having an extremely talkative shadow. \"I don't really understand Quidditch,\" said Colin breathlessly. \"Is it true there are four balls? And two of them fly around trying to knock people off their brooms?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry heavily, resigned to explaining the complicated rules of Quidditch. \"They're called Bludgers. There are two Beaters ), *106* on each team who carry clubs to beat the Bludgers away from their side. Fred and George Weasley are the Gryffindor Beaters.\" \"And what are the other balls for?\" Colin asked, tripping down a couple of steps because he was gazing open-mouthed at Harry. \"Well, the Quafe - that's the biggish red one - is the one that scores goals. Three Chasers on each team throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through the goal posts at the end of the pitch - they're three long poles with hoops on the end.\" \"And the fourth ball -\" \"- is the Golden Snitch,\" said Harry, \"and it's very small, very fast, and difficult to catch. But that's what the Seeker's got to do, because a game of Quidditch doesn't end until the Snitch has been caught. And whichever team's Seeker gets the Snitch earns his team an extra hundred and fifty points.\" \"And you're the Gryffindor Seeker, aren't you?\" said Colin in awe. \"Yes,\" said Harry as they left the castle and started across the dewdrenched grass. \"And there's the Keeper, too. He guards the goal posts. That's it, really.\" But Colin didn't stop questioning Harry all the way down the sloping lawns to the Quidditch field, and Harry only shook him off when he reached the changing rooms; Colin called after him in a piping voice, \"I'll go and get a good seat, Harry!\" and hurried off to the stands. 92 The rest of the Gryffindor team were already in the changing room. Wood was the only person who looked truly awake. Fred and George Weasley were sitting, puffy-eyed and touslehaired, next to fourth year Alicia Spinnet, who seemed to be nodding off against the wall behind her. Her fellow Chasers, Katie *107* Bell and Angelina Johnson, were yawning side by side opposite them. \"There you are, Harry, what kept you?\" said Wood briskly. \"Now, I wanted a quick talk with you all before we actually get onto the field, because I spent the summer devising a whole new training program, which I really think will make all the difference .... Wood was holding up a large diagram of a Quidditch field, on which were drawn many lines, arrows, and crosses in differentcolored inks. He took out his wand, tapped the board, and the arrows began to wiggle over the diagram like caterpillars. As Wood launched into a speech about his new tactics, Fred Weasley's head drooped right onto Alicia Spinnet's shoulder and he began to snore. The first board took nearly twenty minutes to explain, but there was another board under that, and a third under that one. Harry sank into a stupor as Wood droned on and on. \"So,\" said Wood, at long last, jerking Harry from a wistful fantasy about what he could be eating for breakfast at this very moment up at the castle. \"Is that clear? Any questions?\" \"I've got a question, Oliver,\" said George, who had woken with a start. \"Why couldn't you have told us all this yesterday when we were awake?\" Wood wasn't pleased. \"Now, listen here, you lot,\" he said, glowering at them all. \"We should have won the Quidditch cup last year. We're easily the best team. But unfortunately -owing to circumstances beyond our control - \" 93 *108* Harry shifted guiltily in his seat. He had been unconscious in the hospital wing for the final match of the previous year, meaning that Gryffindor had been a player short and had suffered their worst defeat in three hundred years. Wood took a moment to regain control of himself. Their last defeat was clearly still torturing him. \"So this year, we train harder than ever before .... Okay, let's go and put our new theories into practice!\" Wood shouted, seizing his broomstick and leading the way out of the locker rooms. Stifflegged and still yawning, his team followed. They had been in the locker room so long that the sun was up completely now, although remnants of mist hung over the grass in the stadium. As Harry walked onto the field, he saw Ron and Hermione sitting in the stands. \"Aren't you finished yet?\" called Ron incredulously. \"Haven't even started,\" said Harry, looking jealously at the toast and marmalade Ron and Hermione had brought out of the Great Hall. \"Wood's been teaching us new moves.\" He mounted his broomstick and kicked at the ground, soaring up into the air. The cool morning air whipped his face, waking him far more effectively than Wood's long talk. It felt wonderful to be back on the Quidditch field. He soared right around the stadium at full speed, racing Fred and George. \"What's that funny clicking noise?\" called Fred as they hurtled around the corner. Harry looked into the stands. Colin was sitting in one of the highest seats, his camera raised, taking picture after picture, the sound strangely magnified in the deserted stadium. *io9* 94 \"Look this way, Harry! This way!\" he cried shrilly. \"Who's that?\" said Fred. \"No idea,\" Harry lied, putting on a spurt of speed that took him as far away as possible from Colin. \"What's going on?\" said Wood, frowning, as he skimmed through the air toward them. \"Why's that first year taking pictures? I don't like it. He could be a Slytherin spy, trying to find out about our new training program.\" \"He's in Gryffindor,\" said Harry quickly. \"And the Slytherins don't need a spy, Oliver,\" said George. \"What makes you say that?\" said Wood testily. \"Because they're here in person,\" said George, pointing. Several people in green robes were walking onto the field, broomsticks in their hands. \"I don't believe it!\" Wood hissed in outrage. \"I booked the field for today! We'll see about this!\" Wood shot toward the ground, landing rather harder than he meant to in his anger, staggering slightly as he dismounted. Harry, Fred, and George followed. \"Flint!\" Wood bellowed at the Slytherin Captain. \"This is our practice time! We got up specially! You can clear off now!\" Marcus Flint was even larger than Wood. He had a look of trollish cunning on his face as he replied, \"Plenty of room for all of us, Wood.\" Angelina, Alicia, and Katie had come over, too. There were no girls on the Slytherin team, who stood shoulder to shoulder, facing the Gryffindors, leering to a man. \"But I booked the field!\" said Wood, positively spitting with rage. \"I booked it!\" 95 *110* \"Ah,\" said Flint. \"But I've got a specially signed note here from Professor Snape. `I, Professor S. Snape, give the Slytherin team permission to practice today on the Quidditch field owing to the need to train their new Seeker.\"' \"You've got a new Seeker?\" said Wood, distracted. \"Where?\" And from behind the six large figures before them came a seventh, smaller boy, smirking all over his pale, pointed face. It was Draco Malfoy. \"Aren't you Lucius Malfoy's son?\" said Fred, looking at Malfoy with dislike. \"Funny you should mention Draco's father,\" said Flint as the whole Slytherin team smiled still more broadly. \"Let me show you the generous gift he's made to the Slytherin team.\" All seven of them held out their broomsticks. Seven highly polished, brand-new handles and seven sets of fine gold lettering spelling the words Nimbus Two Thousand and One gleamed under the Gryffindors' noses in the early morning sun. \"Very latest model. Only came out last month,\" said Flint carelessly, flicking a speck of dust from the end of his own. \"I believe it outstrips the old Two Thousand series by a considerable amount. As for the old Cleansweeps\" - he smiled nastily at Fred and George, who were both clutching Cleansweep Fives - \"sweeps the board with them.\" None of the Gryffindor team could think of anything to say for a moment. Malfoy was smirking so broadly his cold eyes were reduced to slits. \"Oh, look,\" said Flint. \"A field invasion.\" Ron and Hermione were crossing the grass to see what was going on. *111* 96 \"What's happening?\" Ron asked Harry. \"Why aren't you playing? And what's he doing here?\" He was looking at Malfoy, taking in his Slytherin Quidditch robes. \"I'm the new Slytherin Seeker, Weasley,\" said Malfoy, smugly. \"Everyone's just been admiring the brooms my father's bought our team. Ron gaped, open-mouthed, at the seven superb broomsticks in front of him. \"Good, aren't they?\" said Malfoy smoothly. \"But perhaps the Gryffindor team will be able to raise some gold and get new brooms, too. You could raffle off those Cleansweep Fives; I expect a museum would bid for them.\" The Slytherin team howled with laughter. \"At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in,\" said Hermione sharply. \"They got in on pure talent.\" The smug look on Malfoy's face flickered. \"No one asked your opinion, you fiIthy little Mudblood,\" he spat. Harry knew at once that Malfoy had said something really bad because there was an instant uproar at his words. Flint had to dive in front of Malfoy to stop Fred and George jumping on him, Alicia shrieked, \"How dare you!\" ; and Ron plunged his hand into his robes, pulled out his wand, yelling, \"You'll pay for that one, Malfoy!\" and pointed it furiously under Flint's arm at Malfoys face. A loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of green light shot out of the wrong end of Ron's wand, hitting him in the stomach and sending him reeling backward onto the grass. 12 \"Ron! Ron! Are you all right?\" squealed Hermione. Ron opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out. Instead he 97 gave an almighty belch and several slugs dribbled out of his mouth onto his lap. The Slytherin team were paralyzed with laughter. Flint was doubled up, hanging onto his new broomstick for support. Malfoy was on all fours, banging the ground with his fist. The Gryffindors were gathered around Ron, who kept belching large, glistening slugs. Nobody seemed to want to touch him. \"We'd better get him to Hagrid's, it's nearest,\" said Harry to Hermione, who nodded bravely, and the pair of them pulled Ron up by the arms. \"What happened, Harry? What happened? Is he ill? But you can cure him, can't you?\" Colin had run down from his seat and was now dancing alongside them as they left the field. Ron gave a huge heave and more slugs dribbled down his front. \"Oooh,\" said Colin, fascinated and raising his camera. \"Can you hold him still, Harry?\" \"Get out of the way, Colin!\" said Harry angrily. He and Hermione supported Ron out of the stadium and across the grounds toward the edge of the forest. \"Nearly there, Ron,\" said Hermione as the gamekeeper's cabin came into view. \"You'll be all right in a minute - almost there -\" They were within twenty feet of Hagrid's house when the front door opened, but it wasn't Hagrid who emerged. Gilderoy Lockhart, wearing robes of palest mauve today, came striding out. \"Quick, behind here,\" Harry hissed, dragging Ron behind a nearby bush. Hermione followed, somewhat reluctantly. *113* * \"It's a simple matter if you know what you're doing!\" Lockhart was saying loudly to Hagrid. \"If you need help, you know where I am! I'll let you have a copy of my book. I'm surprised you haven't already got one - I'll sign one tonight and send it over. Well, good-bye!\" And he strode away toward the castle. 98 Harry waited until Lockhart was out of sight, then pulled Ron out of the bush and up to Hagrid's front door. They knocked urgently. Hagrid appeared at once, looking very grumpy, but his expression brightened when he saw who it was. \"Bin wonderin' when you'd come ter see me - come in, come in - thought you mighta bin Professor Lockhart back again -\" Harry and Hermione supported Ron over the threshold into the oneroomed cabin, which had an enormous bed in one corner, a fire crackling merrily in the other. Hagrid didn't seem perturbed by Ron's slug problem, which Harry hastily explained as he lowered Ron into a chair. \"Better out than in,\" he said cheerfully, plunking a large copper basin in front of him. \"Get 'em all up, Ron.\" \"I don't think there's anything to do except wait for it to stop,\" said Hermione anxiously, watching Ron bend over the basin. \"That's a difficult curse to work at the best of times, but with a broken wand -\" Hagrid was bustling around making them tea. His boarhound, Fang, was slobbering over Harry. \"What did Lockhart want with you, Hagrid?\" Harry asked, scratching Fang's ears. \"Givin' me advice on gettin' kelpies out of a well,\" growled *114* Hagrid, moving a half-plucked rooster off his scrubbed table and setting down the teapot. \"Like I don' know. An' bangin' on about some banshee he banished. If one word of it was true, I'll eat my kettle.\" It was most unlike Hagrid to criticize a Hogwarts' teacher, and Harry looked at him in surprise. Hermione, however, said in a voice somewhat higher than usual, \"I think you're being a bit unfair. Professor Dumbledore obviously thought he was the best man for 99 the job -\" \"He was the on' man for the job,\" said Hagrid, offering them a Y plate of treacle fudge, while Ron coughed squelchily into his basin. \"An' I mean the on' one. Gettin' very difficult ter find anyone fer Y the Dark Arts job. People aren't too keen ter take it on, see. They're startin' ter think it's jinxed. No one's lasted long fer a while now. So tell me,\" said Hagrid, jerking his head at Ron. \"Who was he tryin' ter curse?\" \"Malfoy called Hermione something - it must've been really bad, because everyone went wild.\" \"It was bad,\" said Ron hoarsely, emerging over the tabletop looking pale and sweaty. \"Malfoy called her `Mudblood,' Hagrid -\" Ron dived out of sight again as a fresh wave of slugs made their appearance. Hagrid looked outraged. \"He didn'!\" he growled at Hermione. \"He did,\" she said. \"But I don't know what it means. I could tell it was really rude, of course -\" \"It's about the most insulting thing he could think of,\" gasped Ron, coming back up. \"Mudblood's a really foul name for someone who is Muggle-born - you know, non-magic parents. There are *115* some wizards - like Malfoy's family - who think they're better than everyone else because they're what people call pure-blood.\" He gave a small burp, and a single slug fell into his outstretched hand. He threw it into the basin and continued, \"I mean, the rest of us know it doesn't make any difference at all. Look at Neville Longbottom - he's pure-blood and he can hardly stand a cauldron the right way up.\" \"An' they haven't invented a spell our Hermione can' do,\" said Hagrid proudly, making Hermione go a brilliant shade of magenta. 100 \"It's a disgusting thing to call someone,\" said Ron, wiping his sweaty brow with a shaking hand. \"Dirty blood, see. Common blood. It's ridiculous. Most wizards these days are half-blood anyway. If we hadn't married Muggles we'd've died out.\" He retched and ducked out of sight again. \"Well, I don' blame yeh fer tryin' ter curse him, Ron,\" said Hagrid loudly over the thuds of more slugs hitting the basin. \"Bu' maybe it was a good thing yer wand backfired. 'Spect Lucius Malfoy would've come marchin' up ter school if yeh'd cursed his son. Least yer not in trouble.\" Harry would have pointed out that trouble didn't come much worse than having slugs pouring out of your mouth, but he couldn't; Hagrid's treacle fudge had cemented his jaws together. \"Harry,\" said Hagrid abruptly as though struck by a sudden thought. \"Gotta bone ter pick with yeh. I've heard you've bin givin' out signed photos. How come I haven't got one?\" Furious, Harry wrenched his teeth apart. \"I have not been giving out signed photos,\" he said hotly. \"If Lockhart's still spreading that around -\" *116* But then he saw that Hagrid was laughing. \"I'm on'y jokin',\" he said, patting Harry genially on the back and sending him face first into the table. \"I knew yeh hadn't really. I told Lockhart yeh didn' need teh. Yer more famous than him without tryin'.\" \"Bet he didn't like that,\" said Harry, sitting up and rubbing his chin. \"Don' think he did,\" said Hagrid, his eyes twinkling. \"An' then I told him Id never read one o' his books an' he decided ter go. Treacle fudge, Ron?\" he added as Ron reappeared. 101 \"No thanks,\" said Ron weakly. \"Better not risk it.\" \"Come an' see what I've bin growin',\" said Hagrid as Harry and Hermione finished the last of their tea. In the small vegetable patch behind Hagrid's house were a dozen of the largest pumpkins Harry had ever seen. Each was the size of a large boulder. \"Gettin' on well, aren't they?\" said Hagrid happily. \"Fer the Halloween feast ... should be big enough by then.\" \"What've you been feeding them?\" said Harry. Hagrid looked over his shoulder to check that they were alone. \"Well, I've bin givin' them - you know - a bit o' help -\" Harry noticed Hagrid's flowery pink umbrella leaning against the back wall of the cabin. Harry had had reason to believe before now that this umbrella was not all it looked; in fact, he had the strong impression that Hagrid's old school wand was concealed inside it. Hagrid wasn't supposed to use magic. He had been expelled from Hogwarts in his third year, but Harry had never found out why -any mention of the matter and Hagrid would clear his *117* throat loudly and become mysteriously deaf until the subject was changed. \"An Engorgement Charm, I suppose?\" said Hermione, halfway between disapproval and amusement. \"Well, you've done a good job on them.\" \"That's what yer little sister said,\" said Hagrid, nodding at Ron. \"Met her jus' yesterday.\" Hagrid looked sideways at Harry, his beard twitching. \"Said she was jus' lookin' round the grounds, but I reckon she was hopin' she might run inter someone else at my house.\" He winked at Harry. \"If yeh ask me, she wouldn' say no ter a signed -\" \"Oh, shut up,\" said Harry. Ron snorted with laughter and the ground 102 was sprayed with slugs. \"Watch it!\" Hagrid roared, pulling Ron away from his precious pumpkins. It was nearly lunchtime and as Harry had only had one bit of treacle fudge since dawn, he was keen to go back to school to eat. They said good-bye to Hagrid and walked back up to the castle, Ron hiccoughing occasionally, but only bringing up two very small slugs. They had barely set foot in the cool entrance hall when a voice rang out, \"There you are, Potter - Weasley.\" Professor McGonagall was walking toward them, looking stern. \"You will both do your detentions this evening.\" \"What're we doing, Professor?\" said Ron, nervously suppressing a burp. \"You will be polishing the silver in the trophy room with Mr. Filch,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"And no magic, Weasley - elbow grease.\" *118* Ron gulped. Argus Filch, the caretaker, was loathed by every student in the school. \"And you, Potter, will be helping Professor Lockhart answer his fan mail,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Oh n - Professor, can't I go and do the trophy room, too?\" said Harry desperately. \"Certainly not,\" said Professor McGonagall, raising her eyebrows. \"Professor Lockhart requested you particularly. Eight o'clock sharp, both of you.\" Harry and Ron slouched into the Great Hall in states of deepest gloom, Hermione behind them, wearing a well-you-did-break-schoolrules sort of expression. Harry didn't enjoy his shepherd's pie as much as he'd thought. Both he and Ron felt they'd got the worse deal. \"Filch'll have me there all night,\" said Ron heavily. \"No magic! There 103 must be about a hundred cups in that room. I'm no good at Muggle cleaning.\" \"I'd swap anytime,\" said Harry hollowly. \"I've had loads of practice with the Dursleys. Answering Lockhart's fan mail ... he'll be a nightmare ...... Saturday afternoon seemed to melt away, and in what seemed like no time, it was five minutes to eight, and Harry was dragging his feet along the second-floor corridor to Lockhart's office. He gritted his teeth and knocked. The door flew open at once. Lockhart beamed down at him. \"Ah, here's the scalawag!\" he said. \"Come in, Harry, come in -\" Shining brightly on the walls by the light of many candles were countless framed photographs of Lockhart. He had even signed a few of them. Another large pile lay on his desk. \"You can address the envelopes!\" Lockhart told Harry, as though this was a huge treat. \"This first one's to Gladys Gudgeon, bless her - huge fan of mine -\" The minutes snailed by. Harry let Lockhart's voice wash over him, occasionally saying, \"Mmm\" and \"Right\" and \"Yeah.\" Now and then he caught a phrase like, \"Fame's a fickle friend, Harry,\" or \"Celebrity is as celebrity does, remember that.\" The candles burned lower and lower, making the light dance over the many moving faces of Lockhart watching him. Harry moved his aching hand over what felt like the thousandth envelope, writing out Veronica Smethley's address. It must be nearly time to leave, Harry thought miserably, please let it be nearly time... And then he heard something - something quite apart from the spitting of the dying candles and Lockhart's prattle about his fans. It was a voice, a voice to chill the bone marrow, a voice of breathtaking, ice-cold venom. 104 \"Come ... come to me.... Let me rip you.... Let me tear you .... Let me kill you . . . .\" Harry gave a huge jump and a large lilac blot appeared on Veronica Smethley's street. \"What?\" he said loudly. \"I know!\" said Lockhart. \"Six solid months at the top of the bestseller list! Broke all records!\" \"No,\" said Harry frantically. \"That voice!\" \"Sorry?\" said Lockhart, looking puzzled. \"What voice?\" \"That - that voice that said - didn't you hear it?\" Lockhart was looking at Harry in high astonishment. * 3-2o * \"What are you talking about, Harry? Perhaps you're getting a litde drowsy? Great Scott - look at the time! We've been here nearly four hours! Id never have believed it - the time's flown, hasn't it?\" Harry didn't answer. He was straining his ears to hear the voice again, but there was no sound now except for Lockhart telling him he mustn't expect a treat like this every time he got detention. Feeling dazed, Harry left. It was so late that the Gryffindor common room was almost empty. Harry went straight up to the dormitory. Ron wasn't back yet. Harry pulled on his pajamas, got into bed, and waited. Half an hour later, Ron arrived, nursing his right arm and bringing a strong smell of polish into the darkened room. \"My muscles have all seized up,\" he groaned, sinking on his bed. \"Fourteen times he made me buff up that Quidditch cup before he was satisfied. And then I had another slug attack all over a Special Award for Services to the School. Took ages to get the slime off... How was it with Lockhart?\" 105 Keeping his voice low so as not to wake Neville, Dean, and Seamus, Harry told Ron exactly what he had heard. \"And Lockhart said he couldn't hear it?\" said Ron. Harry could see him frowning in the moonlight. \"D'you think he was lying? But I don't get it - even someone invisible would've had to open the door.\" \"I know,\" said Harry, lying back in his four-poster and staring at the canopy above him. \"I don't get it either.\" * 12-1 * 122 October arrived, spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the castle. Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds among the staff and students. Her Pepperup potion worked instantly, though it left the drinker smoking at the ears for several hours afterward. Ginny Weasley, who had been looking pale, was bullied into taking some by Percy. The steam pouring from under her vivid hair gave the impression that her whole head was on fire. Raindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle windows for days on end; the lake rose, the flower beds turned into muddy streams, and Hagrid's pumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds. Oliver Wood's enthusiasm for regular training sessions, however, was not dampened, which was why Harry was to be found, late one stormy Saturday afternoon a few days before Halloween, returning to Gryffindor Tower, drenched to the skin and splattered with mud.. 123 Even aside from the rain and wind it hadn't been a happy practice session. Fred and George, who had been spying on the Slytherin team, had seen for themselves the speed of those new Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones. They reported that the Slytherin team was no more than seven greenish blurs, shooting through the air like missiles. As Harry squelched along the deserted corridor he came across somebody who looked just as preoccupied as he was. Nearly Headless Nick, the ghost of Gryffindor Tower, was staring morosely out of a window, muttering under his breath, \". . . don't fulfill their requirements . . . half an inch, if that . . .\" \"Hello, Nick,\" said Harry. 106 \"Hello, hello,\" said Nearly Headless Nick, starting and looking round. He wore a dashing, plumed hat on his long curly hair, and a tunic with a ruff, which concealed the fact that his neck was almost completely severed. He was pale as smoke, and Harry could see right through him to the dark sky and torrential rain outside. \"You look troubled, young Potter,\" said Nick, folding a transparent letter as he spoke and tucking it inside his doublet. \"So do you,\" said Harry. \"Ah,\" Nearly Headless Nick waved an elegant hand, \"a matter of no importance. . . . It's not as though I really wanted to join. . . . Thought I'd apply, but apparently I 'don't fulfill requirements' -\" In spite of his airy tone, there was a look of great bitterness on his face. \"But you would think, wouldn't you,\" he erupted suddenly, pulling the letter back out of his pocket, \"that getting hit forty-five times in the neck with a blunt axe would qualify you to join the Headless Hunt?\" 124 \"Oh - yes,\" said Harry, who was obviously supposed to agree. \"I mean, nobody wishes more than I do that it had all been quick and clean, and my head had come off properly, I mean, it would have saved me a great deal of pain and ridicule. However -\" Nearly Headless Nick shook his letter open and read furiously: \"'We can only accept huntsmen whose heads have parted company with their bodies. You will appreciate that it would be impossible otherwise for members to participate in hunt activities such as Horseback Head-Juggling and Head Polo. It is with the greatest regret, therefore, that I must inform you that you do not fulfill our requirements. With very best wishes, Sir Patrick Delaney-Podmore.'\" Fuming, Nearly Headless Nick stuffed the letter away. \"Half an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on, Harry! Most people would think that's good and beheaded, but oh, no, it's not enough for Sir Properly Decapitated-Podmore.\" Nearly Headless Nick took several deep breaths and then said, in a far calmer tone, \"So - what's bothering you? Anything I can do?\" \"No,\" said Harry. \"Not unless you know where we can get seven free Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones for our match against Sly -\" The rest of Harry's sentence was drowned out by a high-pitched mewling from somewhere near his ankles. He looked down and found himself gazing into a pair of lamp-like yellow eyes. It was Mrs. Norris, the skeletal gray cat who was used by the caretaker, Argus Filch, as a sort of deputy in his endless battle against students. \"You'd better get out of here, Harry,\" said Nick quickly. \"Filch isn't in a 107 good mood - he's got the flu and some third years accidentally plastered frog brains all over the ceiling in dungeon five. He's been cleaning all morning, and if he sees you dripping mud all over the place -\" .125 \"Right,\" said Harry, backing away from the accusing stare of Mrs. Norris, but not quickly enough. Drawn to the spot by the mysterious power that seemed to connect him with his foul cat, Argus Filch burst suddenly through a tapestry to Harry's right, wheezing and looking wildly about for the rule-breaker. There was a thick tartan scarf bound around his head, and his nose was unusually purple. \"Filth!\" he shouted, his jowls aquiver, his eyes popping alarmingly as he pointed at the muddy puddle that had dripped from Harry's Quidditch robes. \"Mess and muck everywhere! I've had enough of it, I tell you! Follow me, Potter!\" So Harry waved a gloomy good-bye to Nearly Headless Nick and followed Filch back downstairs, doubling the number of muddy footprints on the floor. Harry had never been inside Filch's office before; it was a place most students avoided. The room was dingy and windowless, lit by a single oil lamp dangling from the low ceiling. A faint smell of fried fish lingered about the place. Wooden filing cabinets stood around the walls; from their labels, Harry could see that they contained details of every pupil Filch had ever punished. Fred and George Weasley had an entire drawer to themselves. A highly polished collection of chains and manacles hung on the wall behind Filch's desk. It was common knowledge that he was always begging Dumbledore to let him suspend students by their ankles from the ceiling. Filch grabbed a quill from a pot on his desk and began shuffling around looking for parchment. \"Dung,\" he muttered furiously, \"great sizzling dragon bogies . . . frog brains . . . rat intestines . . . I've had enough of it . . . make an example . . . where's the form . . . yes . . .\" .126 He retrieved a large roll of parchment from his desk drawer and stretched it out in front of him, dipping his long black quill into the ink pot. \"Name . . . Harry Potter. Crime . . .\" \"It was only a bit of mud!\" said Harry. \"It's only a bit of mud to you, boy, but to me it's an extra hour scrubbing!\" shouted Filch, a drip shivering unpleasantly at the end of his bulbous nose. \"Crime . . . befouling the castle . . . suggested sentence . . .\" Dabbing at his streaming nose, Filch squinted unpleasantly at Harry who 108 waited with bated breath for his sentence to fall. But as Filch lowered his quill, there was a great BANG! on the ceiling of the office, which made the oil lamp rattle. \"PEEVES!\" Filch roared, flinging down his quill in a transport of rage. \"I'll have you this time, I'll have you!\" And without a backward glance at Harry, Filch ran flat-footed from the office, Mrs. Norris streaking alongside him. Peeves was the school poltergeist, a grinning, airborne menace who lived to cause havoc and distress. Harry didn't much like Peeves, but couldn't help feeling grateful for his timing. Hopefully, whatever Peeves had done (and it sounded as though he'd wrecked something very big this time) would distract Filch from Harry. Thinking that he should probably wait for Filch to come back, Harry sank into a moth-eaten chair next to the desk. There was only one thing on it apart from his half-completed form: a large, glossy, purple envelope with silver lettering on the front. With a quick glance at the door to check that Filch wasn't on his way back, Harry picked up the envelope and read: kwikspell A Correspondence Course in Beginners' Magic. 127 Intrigued, Harry flicked the envelope open and pulled out the sheaf of parchment inside. More curly silver writing on the front page said: Feel out of step in the world of modern magic? Find yourself making excuses not to perform simple spells? Ever been taunted for your woeful wandwork? There is an answer! Kwikspell is an all-new, fail-safe, quick-result, easy-learn course. Hundreds of witches and wizards have benefited from the Kwikspell method! Madam Z. Nettles of Topsham writes: \"I had no memory for incantations and my potions were a family joke! Now, after a Kwikspell course, I am the center of attention at parties and friends beg for the recipe of my Scintillation Solution!\" Warlock D. J. Prod of Didsbury says: \"My wife used to sneer at my feeble charms, but one month into your fabulous Kwikspell course and I succeeded in turning her into a yak! Thank you, Kwikspell!\" Fascinated, Harry thumbed through the rest of the envelope's contents. Why on earth did Filch want a Kwikspell course? Did this mean he wasn't a proper wizard? Harry was just reading \"Lesson One: Holding Your Wand (Some Useful Tips)\" when shuffling footsteps outside told him Filch was coming back. Stuffing the parchment back into the envelope, Harry threw it back onto the desk just as the door opened. Filch was looking triumphant. \"That vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable!\" he was saying gleefully to Mrs. Norris. \"We'll have Peeves out this time, my sweet -\" 109 His eyes fell on Harry and then darted to the Kwikspell envelope, which, Harry realized too late, was lying two feet away from where it had started. Filch's pasty face went brick red. Harry braced himself for a tidal wave of fury. Filch hobbled across to his desk, snatched up the envelope, and threw it into a drawer. \"Have you - did you read -?\" he sputtered. .128 \"No,\" Harry lied quickly. Filch's knobbly hands were twisting together. \"If I thought you'd read my private - not that it's mine - for a friend - be that as it may - however -\" Harry was staring at him, alarmed; Filch had never looked madder. His eyes were popping, a tic was going in one of his pouchy cheeks, and the tartan scarf didn't help. \"Very well - go - and don't breathe a word - not that - however, if you didn't read - go now, I have to write up Peeves' report - go -\" Amazed at his luck, Harry sped out of the office, up the corridor, and back upstairs. To escape from Filch's office without punishment was probably some kind of school record. \"Harry! Harry! Did it work?\" Nearly Headless Nick came gliding out of a classroom. Behind him, Harry could see the wreckage of a large black-and-gold cabinet that appeared to have been dropped from a great height. \"I persuaded Peeves to crash it right over Filch's office,\" said Nick eagerly. \"Thought it might distract him -\" \"Was that you?\" said Harry gratefully. \"Yeah, it worked, I didn't even get detention. Thanks, Nick!\" They set off up the corridor together. Nearly Headless Nick, Harry noticed, was still holding Sir Patrick's rejection letter.. 129 \"I wish there was something I could do for you about the Headless Hunt,\" Harry said. Nearly Headless Nick stopped in his tracks and Harry walked right through him. He wished he hadn't; it was like stepping through an icy shower. \"But there is something you could do for me,\" said Nick excitedly. \"Harry - would I be asking too much - but no, you wouldn't want -\" \"What is it?\" said Harry. \"Well, this Halloween will be my five hundredth deathday,\" said Nearly Headless Nick, drawing himself up and looking dignified. \"Oh,\" said Harry, not sure whether he should look sorry or happy about this. 110 \"Right.\" \"I'm holding a party down in one of the roomier dungeons. Friends will be coming from all over the country. It would be such an honor if you would attend. Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger would be most welcome, too, of course - but I daresay you'd rather go to the school feast?\" He watched Harry on tenterhooks. \"No,\" said Harry quickly, \"I'll come -\" \"My dear boy! Harry Potter, at my deathday party! And\" - he hesitated, looking excited - \"do you think you could possibly mention to Sir Patrick how very frightening and impressive you find me?\" \"Of - of course,\" said Harry. Nearly Headless Nick beamed at him. \"A deathday party?\" said Hermione keenly when Harry had changed at last and joined her and Ron in the common room. \"I bet there aren't many living people who can say they've been to one of those - it'll be fascinating!\". 130 \"Why would anyone want to celebrate the day they died?\" said Ron, who was halfway through his Potions homework and grumpy. \"Sounds dead depressing to me. . . .\" Rain was still lashing the windows, which were now inky black, but inside all looked bright and cheerful. The firelight glowed over the countless squashy armchairs where people sat reading, talking, doing homework or, in the case of Fred and George Weasley, trying to find out what would happen if you fed a Filibuster firework to a salamander. Fred had \"rescued\" the brilliant orange, fire-dwelling lizard from a Care of Magical Creatures class and it was now smouldering gently on a table surrounded by a knot of curious people. Harry was at the point of telling Ron and Hermione about Filch and the Kwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the air, emitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the room. The sight of Percy bellowing himself hoarse at Fred and George, the spectacular display of tangerine stars showering from the salamander's mouth, and its escape into the fire, with accompanying explosions, drove both Filch and the Kwikspell envelope from Harry's mind. By the time Halloween arrived, Harry was regretting his rash promise to go to the deathday party. The rest of the school was happily anticipating their Halloween feast; the Great Hall had been decorated with the usual live bats, Hagrid's vast pumpkins had been carved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit in, and there were rumors that Dumbledore had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the entertainment. \"A promise is a promise,\" Hermione reminded Harry bossily. \"You said 111 you'd go to the deathday party.\" So at seven o'clock, Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked straight past the doorway to the packed Great Hall, which was glittering invitingly with gold plates and candles, and directed their steps instead toward the dungeons. .131 The passageway leading to Nearly Headless Nick's party had been lined with candles, too, though the effect was far from cheerful: These were long, thin, jet-black tapers, all burning bright blue, casting a dim, ghostly light even over their own living faces. The temperature dropped with every step they took. As Harry shivered and drew his robes tightly around him, he heard what sounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an enormous blackboard. \"Is that supposed to be music?\" Ron whispered. They turned a corner and saw Nearly Headless Nick standing at a doorway hung with black velvet drapes. \"My dear friends,\" he said mournfully. \"Welcome, welcome . . . so pleased you could come. . . .\" He swept off his plumed hat and bowed them inside. It was an incredible sight. The dungeon was full of hundreds of pearly-white, translucent people, mostly drifting around a crowded dance floor, waltzing to the dreadful, quavering sound of thirty musical saws, played by an orchestra on a raised, black-draped platform. A chandelier overhead blazed midnight-blue with a thousand more black candles. Their breath rose in a mist before them; it was like stepping into a freezer. \"Shall we have a look around?\" Harry suggested, wanting to warm up his feet. \"Careful not to walk through anyone,\" said Ron nervously, and they set off around the edge of the dance floor. They passed a group of gloomy nuns, a ragged man wearing chains, and the Fat Friar, a cheerful Hufflepuff ghost, who was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead. Harry wasn't surprised to see that the Bloody Baron, a gaunt, staring Slytherin ghost covered in silver bloodstains, was being given a wide berth by the other ghosts. .132 \"Oh, no,\" said Hermione, stopping abruptly. \"Turn back, turn back, I don't want to talk to Moaning Myrtle -\" \"Who?\" said Harry as they backtracked quickly. \"She haunts one of the toilets in the girls' bathroom on the first floor,\" said Hermione. \"She haunts a toilet?\" 112 \"Yes. It's been out-of-order all year because she keeps having tantrums and flooding the place. I never went in there anyway if I could avoid it; it's awful trying to have a pee with her wailing at you -\" \"Look, food!\" said Ron. On the other side of the dungeon was a long table, also covered in black velvet. They approached it eagerly but next moment had stopped in their tracks, horrified. The smell was quite disgusting. Large, rotten fish were laid on handsome silver platters; cakes, burned charcoal-black, were heaped on salvers; there was a great maggoty haggis, a slab of cheese covered in furry green mold and, in pride of place, an enormous gray cake in the shape of a tombstone, with tar-like icing forming the words, Sir Nicholas de Mimsy- Porpington died 31st October, 1492 Harry watched, amazed, as a portly ghost approached the table, crouched low, and walked through it, his mouth held wide so that it passed through one of the stinking salmon. \"Can you taste it if you walk though it?\" Harry asked him. \"Almost,\" said the ghost sadly, and he drifted away. .133 \"I expect they've let it rot to give it a stronger flavor,\" said Hermione knowledgeably, pinching her nose and leaning closer to look at the putrid haggis. \"Can we move? I feel sick,\" said Ron. They had barely turned around, however, when a little man swooped suddenly from under the table and came to a halt in midair before them. \"Hello, Peeves,\" said Harry cautiously. Unlike the ghosts around them, Peeves the Poltergeist was the very reverse of pale and transparent. He was wearing a bright orange party hat, a revolving bow tie, and a broad grin on his wide, wicked face. \"Nibbles?\" he said sweetly, offering them a bowl of peanuts covered in fungus. \"No thanks,\" said Hermione. \"Heard you talking about poor Myrtle,\" said Peeves, his eyes dancing. \"Rude you was about poor Myrtle.\" He took a deep breath and bellowed, \"OY! MYRTLE!\" \"Oh, no, Peeves, don't tell her what I said, she'll be really upset,\" Hermione whispered frantically. \"I didn't mean it, I don't mind her - er, hello, Myrtle.\" The squat ghost of a girl had glided over. She had the glummest face Harry had ever seen, half-hidden behind lank hair and thick, pearly spectacles. \"What?\" she said sulkily. \"How are you, Myrtle?\" said Hermione in a falsely bright voice. \"It's nice to 113 see you out of the toilet.\" .134 Myrtle sniffed. \"Miss Granger was just talking about you -\" said Peeves slyly in Myrtle's ear. \"Just saying - saying - how nice you look tonight,\" said Hermione, glaring at Peeves. Myrtle eyed Hermione suspiciously. \"You're making fun of me,\" she said, silver tears welling rapidly in her small, see-through eyes. \"No - honestly - didn't I just say how nice Myrtle's looking?\" said Hermione, nudging Harry and Ron painfully in the ribs. \"Oh, yeah -\" \"She did -\" \"Don't lie to me,\" Myrtle gasped, tears now flooding down her face, while Peeves chuckled happily over her shoulder. \"D'you think I don't know what people call me behind my back? Fat Myrtle! Ugly Myrtle! Miserable, moaning, moping Myrtle!\" \"You've forgotten pimply,\" Peeves hissed in her ear. Moaning Myrtle burst into anguished sobs and fled from the dungeon. Peeves shot after her, pelting her with moldy peanuts, yelling, \"Pimply! Pimply!\" \"Oh, dear,\" said Hermione sadly. Nearly Headless Nick now drifted toward them through the crowd. .135 \"Enjoying yourselves?\" \"Oh, yes,\" they lied. \"Not a bad turnout,\" said Nearly Headless Nick proudly. \"The Wailing Widow came all the way up from Kent. . . . It's nearly time for my speech, I'd better go and warn the orchestra. . . .\" The orchestra, however, stopped playing at that very moment. They, and everyone else in the dungeon, fell silent, looking around in excitement, as a hunting horn sounded. \"Oh, here we go,\" said Nearly Headless Nick bitterly. Through the dungeon wall burst a dozen ghost horses, each ridden by a headless horseman. The assembly clapped wildly; Harry started to clap, too, but stopped quickly at the sight of Nick's face. The horses galloped into the middle of the dance floor and halted, rearing and plunging. At the front of the pack was a large ghost who held his bearded head under his arm, from which position he was blowing the horn. 114 The ghost leapt down, lifted his head high in the air so he could see over the crowd (everyone laughed), and strode over to Nearly Headless Nick, squashing his head back onto his neck. \"Nick!\" he roared. \"How are you? Head still hanging in there?\" He gave a hearty guffaw and clapped Nearly Headless Nick on the shoulder. \"Welcome, Patrick,\" said Nick stiffly. \"Live 'uns!\" said Sir Patrick, spotting Harry, Ron, and Hermione and giving a huge, fake jump of astonishment, so that his head fell off again (the crowd howled with laughter). .136 \"Very amusing,\" said Nearly Headless Nick darkly. \"Don't mind Nick!\" shouted Sir Patrick's head from the floor. \"Still upset we won't let him join the Hunt! But I mean to say - look at the fellow -\" \"I think,\" said Harry hurriedly, at a meaningful look from Nick, \"Nick's very - frightening and - er -\" \"Ha!\" yelled Sir Patrick's head. \"Bet he asked you to say that!\" \"If I could have everyone's attention, it's time for my speech!\" said Nearly Headless Nick loudly, striding toward the podium and climbing into an icy blue spotlight. \"My late lamented lords, ladies, and gentlemen, it is my great sorrow . . .\" But nobody heard much more. Sir Patrick and the rest of the Headless Hunt had just started a game of Head Hockey and the crowd were turning to watch. Nearly Headless Nick tried vainly to recapture his audience, but gave up as Sir Patrick's head went sailing past him to loud cheers. Harry was very cold by now, not to mention hungry. \"I can't stand much more of this,\" Ron muttered, his teeth chattering, as the orchestra ground back into action and the ghosts swept back onto the dance floor. \"Let's go,\" Harry agreed. They backed toward the door, nodding and beaming at anyone who looked at them, and a minute later were hurrying back up the passageway full of black candles. \"Pudding might not be finished yet,\" said Ron hopefully, leading the way toward the steps to the entrance hall. .137 And then Harry heard it. \". . . rip . . . tear . . . kill . . .\" It was the same voice, the same cold, murderous voice he had heard in Lockhart's office. He stumbled to a halt, clutching at the stone wall, listening with all his 115 might, looking around, squinting up and down the dimly lit passageway. \"Harry, what're you -?\" \"It's that voice again - shut up a minute -\" \". . . soo hungry . . . for so long . . .\" \"Listen!\" said Harry urgently, and Ron and Hermione froze, watching him. \". . . kill . . . time to kill . . .\" The voice was growing fainter. Harry was sure it was moving away - moving upward. A mixture of fear and excitement gripped him as he stared at the dark ceiling; how could it be moving upward? Was it a phantom, to whom stone ceilings didn't matter? \"This way,\" he shouted, and he began to run, up the stairs, into the entrance hall. It was no good hoping to hear anything here, the babble of talk from the Halloween feast was echoing out of the Great Hall. Harry sprinted up the marble staircase to the first floor, Ron and Hermione clattering behind him. \"Harry, what're we -\" \"SHH!\" .138 Harry strained his ears. Distantly, from the floor above, and growing fainter still, he heard the voice: \". . . I smell blood. . . . I SMELL BLOOD!\" His stomach lurched - \"It's going to kill someone!\" he shouted, and ignoring Ron's and Hermione's bewildered faces, he ran up the next flight of steps three at a time, trying to listen over his own pounding footsteps - Harry hurtled around the whole of the second floor, Ron and Hermione panting behind him, not stopping until they turned a corner into the last, deserted passage. \"Harry, what was that all about?\" said Ron, wiping sweat off his face. \"I couldn't hear anything. . . .\" But Hermione gave a sudden gasp, pointing down the corridor. \"Look!\" Something was shining on the wall ahead. They approached slowly, squinting through the darkness. Foot-high words had been daubed on the wall between two windows, shimmering in the light cast by the flaming torches. the chamber of secrets has been opened. enemies of the heir, beware. \"What's that thing - hanging underneath?\" said Ron, a slight quiver in his voice. As they edged nearer, Harry almost slipped - there was a large puddle of water on the floor; Ron and Hermione grabbed him, and they inched toward the message, eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it. All three of them realized what it was at once, and leapt backward with a splash..Mrs. Norris, 116 the caretaker's cat, was hanging by her tail from the torch bracket. She was stiff as a board, her eyes wide and staring. For a few seconds, they didn't move. Then Ron said, \"Let's get out of here.\" \"Shouldn't we try and help -\" Harry began awkwardly. \"Trust me,\" said Ron. \"We don't want to be found here.\" But it was too late. A rumble, as though of distant thunder, told them that the feast had just ended. From either end of the corridor where they stood came the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs, and the loud, happy talk of well-fed people; next moment, students were crashing into the passage from both ends. The chatter, the bustle, the noise died suddenly as the people in front spotted the hanging cat. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood alone, in the middle of the corridor, as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to see the grisly sight. Then someone shouted through the quiet. \"Enemies of the Heir, beware! You'll be next, Mudbloods!\" It was Draco Malfoy. He had pushed to the front of the crowd, his cold eyes alive, his usually bloodless face flushed, as he grinned at the sight of the hanging, immobile cat. C H A P T X IR N I N E THE WRTITING ON THE WALL What's going on here? What's going on?\" Attracted no doubt by Malfoy's shout, Argus Filch came shouldering his way through the crowd. Then he saw Mrs. Norris and fell back, clutching his face in horror. \"My cat! My cat! What's happened to Mrs. Norris?\" he shrieked. And his popping eyes fell on Harry. \"You!\"he screeched. \"You! You've murdered my cat! You've killed her! I'll kill you! I'll -\" \"Argus!\" Dumbledore had arrived on the scene, followed by a number of other 117 teachers. In seconds, he had swept past Harry, Ron, and Hermione and detached Mrs. Norris from the torch bracket. \"Come with me, Argus,\" he said to Filch. \"You, too, Mr. Potter, Mr. Weasley, Miss Granger.\" Lockhart stepped forward eagerly. *140* \"My office is nearest, Headmaster - just upstairs - please feel free -\" \"Thank you, Gilderoy,\" said Dumbledore. The silent crowd parted to let them pass. Lockhart, looking excited and important, hurried after Dumbledore; so did Professors McGonagall and Snape. As they entered Lockhart's darkened office there was a flurry of movement across the walls; Harry saw several of the Lockharts in the pictures dodging out of sight, their hair in rollers. The real Lockhart lit the candles on his desk and stood back. Dumbledore lay Mrs. Norris on the polished surface and began to examine her. Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged tense looks and sank into chairs outside the pool of candlelight, watching. The tip of Dumbledore's long, crooked nose was barely an inch from Mrs. Norris's fur. He was looking at her closely through his half-moon spectacles, his long fingers gently prodding and poking. Professor McGonagall was bent almost as close, her eyes narrowed. Snape loomed behind them, half in shadow, wearing a most peculiar expression: It was as though he was trying hard not to smile. And Lockhart was hovering around all of them, making suggestions. \"It was definitely a curse that killed her - probably the Transmogrifian Torture - I've seen it used many times, so unlucky I wasn't there, I know the very countercurse that would have saved her . ..... Lockhart's comments were punctuated by Filch's dry, racking sobs. He was slumped in a chair by the desk, unable to look at Mrs. Norris, 118 his face in his hands. Much as he detested Filch, Harry *141* couldn't help feeling a bit sorry for him, though not nearly as sorry as he felt for himself If Dumbledore believed Filch, he would be expelled for sure. Dumbledore was now muttering strange words under his breath and tapping Mrs. Norris with his wand but nothing happened: She continued to look as though she had been recently stuffed. \". . . I remember something very similar happening in Ouagadogou,\" said Lockhart, \"a series of attacks, the full story's in my autobiography, I was able to provide the townsfolk with various amulets, which cleared the matter up at once ...... The photographs of Lockhart on the walls were all nodding in agreement as he talked. One of them had forgotten to remove his hair net. At last Dumbledore straightened up. \"She's not dead, Argus,\" he said softly. Lockhart stopped abruptly in the middle of counting the number of murders he had prevented. \"Not dead?\" choked Filch, looking through his fingers at Mrs. Norris. \"But why's she all - all stiff and frozen?\" \"She has been Petrified,\" said Dumbledore (\"Ah! I thought so!\" said Lockhart). \"But how, I cannot say . . . .\" \"Ask him!\" shrieked Filch, turning his blotched and tearstained face to Harry. \"No second year could have done this,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"it would take Dark Magic of the most advanced -\" \"He did it, he did it!\" Filch spat, his pouchy face purpling. \"You saw what he wrote on the wall! He found - in my office - he knows I'm a - 119 I'm a -\" Filch's face worked horribly. \"He knows I'm a Squib!\" he finished. 142 \"I never touched Mrs. Norris!\" Harry said loudly, uncomfortably aware of everyone looking at him, including all the Lockharts on the walls. \"And I don't even know what a Squib is.\" \"Rubbish!\" snarled Filch. \"He saw my Kwikspell letter!\" \"If I might speak, Headmaster,\" said Snape from the shadows, and Harry's sense of forboding increased; he was sure nothing Snape had to say was going to do him any good. \"Potter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time,\" he said, a slight sneer curling his mouth as though he doubted it. \"But we do have a set of suspicious circumstances here. Why was he in the upstairs corridor at all? Why wasn't he at the Halloween feast?\" Harry, Ron and Hermione all launched into an explanation about the deathday party. \". . . there were hundreds of ghosts, theyll tell you we were there -\" \"But why not join the feast afterward?\" said Snape, his black eyes glittering in the candlelight. \"Why go up to that corridor?\" Ron and Hermione looked at Harry. \"Because - because -\" Harry said, his heart thumping very fast; something told him it would sound very far-fetched if he told them he had been led there by a bodiless voice no one but he could hear, \"because we were tired and wanted to go to bed,\" he said. \"Without any supper?\" said Snape, a triumphant smile flickering across his gaunt face. \"I didn't think ghosts provided food fit for living people at their parties.\" \"We weren't hungry,\" said Ron loudly as his stomach gave a huge rumble. 120 Snape's nasty smile widened. *143* \"I suggest, Headmaster, that Potter is not being entirely truthful,\" he said. \"It might be a good idea if he were deprived of certain privileges until he is ready to tell us the whole story. I personally feel he should be taken off the Gryffindor Quidditch team until he is ready to be honest.\" \"Really, Severus,\" said Professor McGonagall sharply, \"I see no reason to stop the boy playing Quidditch. This cat wasn't hit over the head with a broomstick. There is no evidence at all that Potter has done anything wrong.\" Dumbledore was giving Harry a searching look. His twinkling lightblue gaze made Harry feel as though he were being X-rayed. \"Innocent until proven guilty, Severus,\" he said firmly. Snape looked furious. So did Filch. \"My cat has been Petrified!\" he shrieked, his eyes popping. \"I want to see some punishment!\" \"We will be able to cure her, Argus,\" said Dumbledore patiently. \"Professer Sprout recently managed to procure some Mandrakes. As soon as they have reached their full size, I will have a potion made that will revive Mrs. Norris.\" \"I'll make it,\" Lockhart butted in. \"I must have done it a hundred times. I could whip up a Mandrake Restorative Draught in my sleep -\" \"Excuse me,\" said Snape icily. \"But I believe I am the Potions master at this school.\" There was a very awkward pause. \"You may go,\" Dumbledore said to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. They went, as quickly as they could without actually running. When they were a floor up from Lockhart's office, they turned into 121 *144* an empty classroom and closed the door quietly behind them. Harry squinted at his friends' darkened faces. \"D'you think I should have told them about that voice I heard?\" \"No,\" said Ron, without hesitation. \"Hearing voices no one else can hear isn't a good sign, even in the wizarding world.\" Something in Ron's voice made Harry ask, \"You do believe me, don't you?\" \"'Course I do,\" said Ron quickly. \"But -you must admit it's weird ...... \"I know it's weird,\" said Harry. \"The whole thing's weird. What was that writing on the wall about? The Cbamber Has Been Opened... What's that supposed to mean?\" \"You know, it rings a sort of bell,\" said Ron slowly. \"I think someone told me a story about a secret chamber at Hogwarts once ... might've been Bill . . . .\" \"And what on earth's a Squib?\" said Harry. To his surprise, Ron stifled a snigger. \"Well - it's not funny really - but as it's Filch, he said. \"A Squib is someone who was born into a wizarding family but hasn't got any magic powers. Kind of the opposite of Muggle-born wizards, but Squibs are quite unusual. If Filch's trying to learn magic from a Kwikspell course, I reckon he must be a Squib. It would explain a lot. Like why he hates students so much.\" Ron gave a satisfied smile. \"He's bitter.\" A clock chimed somewhere. \"Midnight,\" said Harry. \"We'd better get to bed before Snape comes along and tries to frame us for something else.\" *145* 122 For a few days, the school could talk of little else but the attack on Mrs. Norris. Filch kept it fresh in everyone's minds by pacing the spot where she had been attacked, as though he thought the attacker might come back. Harry had seen him scrubbing the message on the wall with Mrs. Skower's All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover, but to no effect; the words still gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone. When Filch wasn't guarding the scene of the crime, he was skulking redeyed through the corridors, lunging out at unsuspecting students and trying to put them in detention for things like \"breathing loudly' and \"looking happy.\" Ginny Weasley seemed very disturbed by Mrs. Norris's fate. According to Ron, she was a great cat lover. \"But you haven't really got to know Mrs. Norris,\" Ron told her bracingly. \"Honestly, we're much better off without her.\" Ginny's lip trembled. \"Stuff like this doesn't often happen at Hogwarts,\" Ron assured her. \"They'll catch the maniac who did it and have him out of here in no time. I just hope he's got time to Petrify Filch before he's expelled. I'm only joking -\" Ron added hastily as Ginny blanched. The attack had also had an effect on Hermione. It was quite usual for Hermione to spend a lot of time reading, but she was now doing almost nothing else. Nor could Harry and Ron get much response from her when they asked what she was up to, and not until the following Wednesday did they find out. Harry had been held back in Potions, where Snape had made him stay behind to scrape tubeworms off the desks. After a hurried lunch, he went upstairs to meet Ron in the library, and saw Justin Finch- Fletchley, the Hufflepuff boy from Herbology, coming *146* toward him. Harry had just opened his mouth to say hello when Justin caught sight of him, turned abruptly, and sped off in the opposite direction. Harry found Ron at the back of the library, measuring his History of 123 Magic homework. Professor Binns had asked for a threefoot-long composition on \"The Medieval Assembly of European Wizards.\" \"I don't believe it, I'm still eight inches short said Ron fu riously, letting go of his parchment, which sprang back into a roll. \"And Hermione's done four feet seven inches and her writing's tiny. \" \"Where is she?\" asked Harry, grabbing the tape measure and unrolling his own homework. \"Somewhere over there,\" said Ron, pointing along the shelves. \"Looking for another book. I think she's trying to read the whole library before Christmas.\" Harry told Ron about Justin Finch-Fletchley running away from him. \"Dunno why you care. I thought he was a bit of an idiot,\" said Ron, scribbling away, making his writing as large as possible. \"All that junk about Lockhart being so great -\" Hermione emerged from between the bookshelves. She looked irritable and at last seemed ready to talk to them. \"All the copies of Hogwarts, A History have been taken out,\" she said, sitting down next to Harry and Ron. \"And there's a two-week waiting list. I wish I hadn't left my copy at home, but I couldn't fit it in my trunk with all the Lockhart books.\" \"Why do you want it?\" said Harry. *141* \"The same reason everyone else wants it,\" said Hermione, \"to read up on the legend of the Chamber of Secrets.\" \"What's that?\" said Harry quickly. \"That's just it. I can't remember,\" said Hermione, biting her lip. \"And I can't find the story anywhere else -\" 124 \"Hermione, let me read your composition,\" said Ron desperately, checking his watch. \"No, I won't,\" said Hermione, suddenly severe. \"You've had ten days to finish it -\" \"I only need another two inches, come on -\" The bell rang. Ron and Hermione led the way to History of Magic, bickering. History of Magic was the dullest subject on their schedule. Professor Binns, who taught it, was their only ghost teacher, and the most exciting thing that ever happened in his classes was his entering the room through the blackboard. Ancient and shriveled, many people said he hadn't noticed he was dead. He had simply got up to teach one day and left his body behind him in an armchair in front of the staff room fire; his routine had not varied in the slightest since. Today was as boring as ever. Professor Binns opened his notes and began to read in a flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until nearly everyone in the class was in a deep stupor, occasionally coming to long enough to copy down a name or date, then falling asleep again. He had been speaking for half an hour when something happened that had never happened before. Hermione put up her hand. Professor Binns, glancing up in the middle of a deadly dull lec *148* ture on the International Warlock Convention of 1289, looked amazed. \"Miss - er -?\" \"Granger, Professor. I was wondering if you could tell us anything about the Chamber of Secrets,\" said Hermione in a clear voice. Dean Thomas, who had been sitting with his mouth hanging open, gazing out of the window, jerked out of his trance; Lavender Brown's head came up off her arms and Neville Longbottom's elbow slipped off his desk. 125 Professor Binns blinked. \"My subject is History of Magic,\" he said in his dry, wheezy voice. \"I deal with facts, Miss Granger, not myths and legends.\" He cleared his throat with a small noise like chalk s!-ping and continued, \"In September of that year, a subcommittee of Sardinian sorcerers \" He stuttered to a halt. Hermione's hand was waving in the air again. \"Miss Grant?\" \"Please, sir, don't legends always have a basis in fact?\" Professor Binns was looking at her in such amazement, Harry was sure no student had ever interrupted him before, alive or dead. \"Well,\" said Professor Binns slowly, \"yes, one could argue that, I suppose.\" He peered at Hermione as though he had never seen a student properly before. \"However, the legend of which you speak is such a very sensational, even ludicrous tale -\" But the whole class was now hanging on Professor Binns's every word. He looked dimly at them all, every face turned to his. Harry *149* could tell he was completely thrown by such an unusual show of interest. \"Oh, very well,\" he said slowly. \"Let me see ... the Chamber of Secrets ... \"You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago - the precise date is uncertain - by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age. The four school Houses are named after them: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. They built this castle together, far from prying Muggle eyes, for it was an age when magic was feared by common people, and witches and wizards suffered much persecution.\" 126 He paused, gazed blearily around the room, and continued. \"For a few years, the founders worked in harmony together, seeking out youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to the castle to be educated. But then disagreements sprang up between them. A rift began to grow between Slytherin and the others. Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed that magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. He disliked taking students of Muggle parentage, believing them to be untrustworthy. After a while, there was a serious argument on the subject between Slytherin and Gryffindor, and Slytherin left the school.\" Professor Binns paused again, pursing his lips, looking like a wrinkled old tortoise. \"Reliable historical sources tell us this much,\" he said. \"But these honest facts have been obscured by the fanciful legend of the Chamber of Secrets. The story goes that Slytherin had built a *150* hidden chamber in the castle, of which the other founders knew nothing. \"Slytherin, according to the legend, sealed the Chamber of Secrets so that none would be able to open it until his own true heir arrived at the school. The heir alone would be able to unseal the Chamber of Secrets, unleash the horror within, and use it to purge the school of all who were unworthy to study magic.\" There was silence as he finished telling the story, but it wasn't the usual, sleepy silence that filled Professor Binns's classes. There was unease in the air as everyone continued to watch him, hoping for more. Professor Binns looked faintly annoyed. \"The whole thing is arrant nonsense, of course,\" he said. \"Naturally, the school has been searched for evidence of such a chamber, many times, by the most learned witches and wizards. It does not exist. A tale told to frighten the gullible.\" 127 Hermione's hand was back in the air. \"Sir - what exactly do you mean by the `horror within' the Chamber?\" \"That is believed to be some sort of monster, which the Heir of Slytherin alone can control,\" said Professor Binns in his dry, reedy voice. The class exchanged nervous looks. \"I tell you, the thing does not exist,\" said Professor Binns, shuffling his notes. \"There is no Chamber and no monster.\" \"But, sir,\" said Seamus Finnigan, \"if the Chamber can only be opened by Slytherin's true heir, no one else would be able to find it, would they?\" \"Nonsense, O'Flaherty,\" said Professor Binns in an aggravated *151* tone. \"If a long succession of Hogwarts headmasters and headmistresses haven't found the thing -\" \"But, Professor,\" piped up Parvati Patil, \"you'd probably have to use Dark Magic to open it -\" \"Just because a wizard doesn't use Dark Magic doesn't mean he can't, Miss Pennyfeather,\" snapped Professor Binns. \"I repeat, if the likes of Dumbledore -\" \"But maybe you've got to be related to Slytherin, so Dumbledore couldn't -\" began Dean Thomas, but Professor Binns had had enough. \"That will do,\" he said sharply. \"It is a myth! It does not exist! There is not a shred of evidence that Slytherin ever built so much as a secret broom cupboard! I regret telling you such a foolish story! We will return, if you please, to history, to solid, believable, verifiable fact!\" 128 And within five minutes, the class had sunk back into its usual torpor. \"I always knew Salazar Slytherin was a twisted old loony,\" Ron told Harry and Hermione as they fought their way through the teeming corridors at the end of the lesson to drop off their bags before dinner. \"But I never knew he started all this pure-blood stuff. I wouldn't be in his house if you paid me. Honestly, if the Sorting Hat had tried to put me in Slytherin, I'd've got the train straight back home ...... Hermione nodded fervently, but Harry didn't say anything. His stomach had just dropped unpleasantly. Harry had never told Ron and Hermione that the Sorting Hat *152* had seriously considered putting him in Slytherin. He could remember, as though it were yesterday, the small voice that had spoken in his ear when he'd placed the hat on his head a year before: You could be great, you know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin would help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that... But Harry, who had already heard of Slytherin House's reputa tion for turning out Dark wizards, had thought desperately, Not Slytherin! and the hat had said, Oh, well, if you're sure ... better be Gryffindor... As they were shunted along in the throng, Colin Creevy went past. \"Hiya, Harry!\" \"Hullo, Colin,\" said Harry automatically. \"Harry - Harry - a boy in my class has been saying you're But Colin was so small he couldn~t fight against the tide of people bearing him toward the Great Hall; they heard him squeak, \"See you, Harry!\" and he was gone. \"What's a boy in his class saying about you?\" Hermione wondered. 129 \"That I'm Slytherin's heir, I expect,\" said Harry, his stomach dropping another inch or so as he suddenly remembered the way Justin Finch- Fletchley had run away from him at lunchtime. \"People here'll believe anything,\" said Ron in disgust. The crowd thinned and they were able to climb the next staircase without difficulty. \"D'you really think there's a Chamber of Secrets?\" Ron asked Hermione. \"I don't know,\" she said, frowning. \"Dumbledore couldn't cure * 1,5 % * Mrs. Norris, and that makes me think that whatever attacked her might not be - well - human.\" As she spoke, they turned a corner and found themselves at the end of the very corridor where the attack had happened. They stopped and looked. The scene was just as it had been that night, except that there was no stiff cat hanging from the torch bracket, and an empty chair stood against the wall bearing the message \"The Chamber of Secrets has been Opened.\" \"That's where Filch has been keeping guard,\" Ron muttered. They looked at each other. The corridor was deserted. \"Can't hurt to have a poke around,\" said Harry, dropping his bag and getting to his hands and knees so that he could crawl along, searching for clues. \"Scorch marks!\" he said. \"Here - and here -\" \"Come and look at this!\" said Hermione. \"This is funny . . . .\" Harry got up and crossed to the window next to the message on the wall. Hermione was pointing at the topmost pane, where around twenty spiders were scuttling, apparently fighting to get through a 130 small crack. A long, silvery thread was dangling like a rope, as though they had all climbed it in their hurry to get outside. \"Have you ever seen spiders act like that?\" said Hermione wonderingly. \"No,\" said Harry, \"have you, Ron? Ron?\" He looked over his shoulder. Ron was standing well back and seemed to be fighting the impulse to run. \"What's up?\" said Harry. \"I - don't - like - spiders,\" said Ron tensely. \"I never knew that,\" said Hermione, looking at Ron in surprise. \"You've used spiders in Potions loads of times ...... *154* \"I don't mind them dead,\" said Ron, who was carefully looking anywhere but at the window. \"I just don't like the way they move .... Hermione giggled. \"It's not funny,\" said Ron, fiercely. \"If you must know, when I was three, Fred turned my - my teddy bear into a great big fiIthy spider because I broke his toy broomstick .... You wouldn't like them either if you'd been holding your bear and suddenly it had too many legs and. . . \" He broke off, shuddering. Hermione was obviously still trying not to laugh. Feeling they had better get off the subject, Harry said, \"Remember all that water on the floor? Where did that come from? Someone's mopped it up.\" \"It was about here,\" said Ron, recovering himself to walk a few paces past Filch's chair and pointing. \"Level with this door.\" He reached for the brass doorknob but suddenly withdrew his hand as though he'd been burned. 131 \"What's the matter?\" said Harry. \"Can't go in there,\" said Ron gruffly. \"That's a girls' toilet.\" \"Oh, Ron, there won't be anyone in there,\" said Hermione, standing up and coming over. \"That's Moaning Myrtle's place. Come on, let's have a look.\" And ignoring the large OUT of ORDER sign, she opened the door. It was the gloomiest, most depressing bathroom Harry had ever set foot in. Under a large, cracked, and spotted mirror were a row of chipped sinks. The floor was damp and reflected the dull light given off by the stubs of a few candles, burning low in their holders; the wooden doors to the stalls were flaking and scratched and one of them was dangling off its hinges. * -L 5,5 Hermione put her fingers to her lips and set off toward the end stall. When she reached it she said, \"Hello, Myrtle, how are you?\" Harry and Ron went to look. Moaning Myrtle was floating above the tank of the toilet, picking a spot on her chin. \"This is a girls' bathroom,\" she said, eyeing Ron and Harry suspiciously. \"They're not girls.\" \"No,\" Hermione agreed. \"I just wanted to show them how er - nice it is in here.\" She waved vaguely at the dirty old mirror and the damp floor. \"Ask her if she saw anything,\" Harry mouthed at Hermione. \"What are you whispering?\" said Myrtle, staring at him. \"Nothing,\" said Harry quickly. \"We wanted to ask -\" \"I wish people would stop talking behind my back!\" said Myrtle, in a voice choked with tears. \"I do have feelings, you know, even if I am dead -\" 132 \"Myrtle, no one wants to upset you,\" said Hermione. \"Harry only -\" \"No one wants to upset me! That's a good one!\" howled Myrtle. \"My life was nothing but misery at this place and now people come along ruining my death!\" \"We wanted to ask you if you've seen anything funny lately,\" said Hermione quickly. \"Because a cat was attacked right outside your front door on Halloween.\" \"Did you see anyone near here that night?\" said Harry. \"I wasn't paying attention,\" said Myrtle dramatically. \"Peeves upset me so much I came in here and tried to kill myself Then, of course, I remembered that I'm - that I'm \" \"Already dead,\" said Ron helpfully. * IL 56* Myrtle gave a tragic sob, rose up in the air, turned over, and dived headfirst into the toilet, splashing water all over them and vanishing from sight, although from the direction of her muffled sobs, she had come to rest somewhere in the U-bend. Harry and Ron stood with their mouths open, but Hermione shrugged wearily and said, \"Honestly, that was almost cheerful for Myrtle .... Come on, let's go.\" Harry had barely closed the door on Myrtle's gurgling sobs when a loud voice made all three of them jump. \"RON!\" Percy Weasley had stopped dead at the head of the stairs, prefect badge agleam, an expression of complete shock on his face. \"That's a girls' bathroom!\" he gasped. \"What were you -?\" \"Just having a look around,\" Ron shrugged. \"Clues, you know -\" 133 Percy swelled in a manner that reminded Harry forcefully of Mrs. Weasley. \"Get - away - from - there -\" Perry said, striding toward them and starting to bustle them along, flapping his arms. \"Don't you care what this looks like? Coming back here while everyone's at dinner -\" \"Why shouldn't we be here?\" said Ron hotly, stopping short and glaring at Percy. \"Listen, we never laid a finger on that cat!\" \"That's what I told Ginny,\" said Percy fiercely, \"but she still seems to think you're going to be expelled, I've never seen her so upset, crying her eyes out, you might think of her, all the first years are thoroughly overexcited by this business -\" \"You don't care about Ginny,\" said Ron, whose ears were now *157* reddening. \"You're just worried I'm going to mess up your chances of being Head Boy -\" \"Five points from Gryffindor!\" Percy said tersely, fingering his prefect badge. \"And I hope it teaches you a lesson! No more detective work, or I'll write to Mum!\" And he strode off, the back of his neck as red as Ron's ears. Harry, Ron, and Hermione chose seats as far as possible from Percy in the common room that night. Ron was still in a very bad temper and kept blotting his Charms homework. When he reached absently for his wand to remove the smudges, it ignited the parchment. Fuming almost as much as his homework, Ron slammed The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 shut. To Harry's surprise, Hermione followed suit. \"Who can it be, though?\" she said in a quiet voice, as though continuing a conversation they had just been having. \"Who'd want to frighten all the Squibs and Muggle-borns out of Hogwarts?\" \"Let's think,\" said Ron in mock puzzlement. \"Who do we know who thinks Muggle-borns are scum?\" 134 He looked at Hermione. Hermione looked back, unconvinced. \"If you're talking about Malfoy -\" \"Of course I am!\" said Ron. \"You heard him - `You'll be next, Mudbloods!'- come on, you've only got to look at his foul rat face to know it's him -\" \"Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?\" said Hermione skeptically. \"Look at his family,\" said Harry, closing his books, too. \"The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin; he's always boasting about it. They could easily be Slytherin's descendants. His father's definitely evil enough.\" *158* \"They couldve had the key to the Chamber of Secrets for centuries!\" said Ron. \"Handing it down, father to son ...... \"Well,\" said Hermione cautiously, \"I suppose it's possible ...... \"But how do we prove it?\" said Harry darkly. \"There might be a way,\" said Hermione slowly, dropping her voice still further with a quick glance across the room at Percy. \"Of course, it would be difficult. And dangerous, very dangerous. We'd be breaking about fifty school rules, I expect -\" \"If, in a month or so, you feel like explaining, you will let us know, won't you?\" said Ron irritably. \"All right,\" said Hermione coldly. \"What we'd need to do is to get inside the Slytherin common room and ask Malfoy a few questions without him realizing it's us.\" \"But that's impossible,\" Harry said as Ron laughed. \"No, it's not,\" said Hermione. \"All we'd need would be some Polyjuice Potion.\" \"What's that?\" said Ron and Harry together. 135 \"Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago -\" \"D'you think we've got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to Snape?\" muttered Ron. \"It transforms you into somebody else. Think about it! We could change into three of the Slytherins. No one would know it was us. Malfoy would probably tell us anything. He's probably boasting about it in the Slytherin common room right now, if only we could hear him.\" \"This Polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me,\" said Ron, frowning. \"What if we were stuck looking like three of the Slytherins forever?\" \"It wears off after a while,\" said Hermione, waving her hand *159* impatiently. \"But getting hold of the recipe will be very difficult. Snape said it was in a book called Moste Potente Potions and it's bound to be in the Restricted Section of the library.\" There was only one way to get out a book from the Restricted Section: You needed a signed note of permission from a teacher. \"Hard to see why we'd want the book, really,\" said Ron, \"if we weren't going to try and make one of the potions.\" \"I think,\" said Hermione, \"that if we made it sound as though we were just interested in the theory, we might stand a chance ...... \"Oh, come on, no teacher's going to fall for that,\" said Ron. \"They'd have to be really thick . . . .\" C H-H A P T V It T 1' N THE ROGUE BLUDGER ince the disastrous episode of the pixies, Professor Lockhart had not brought live creatures to class. Instead, he read passages from his books to them, and sometimes reenacted some of the more dramatic bits. He usually picked Harry to help him with these reconstructions; so far, Harry had been forced to play a simple Transylvanian villager whom Lockhart had cured of a Babbling Curse, a yeti with a head cold, and a vampire who had been unable to eat anything except lettuce since Lockhart had dealt with him. 136 Harry was hauled to the front of the class during their very next Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson, this time acting a werewolf If he hadn't had a very good reason for keeping Lockhart in a good mood, he would have refused to do it. \"Nice loud howl, Harry - exactly - and then, if you'll believe it, I pounced - like this - slammed him to the floor - thus with one hand, I managed to hold him down - with my other, I *161* put my wand to his throat -I then screwed up my remaining strength and performed the immensely complex Homorphus Charm - he let out a piteous moan - go on, Harry - higher than that - good - the fur vanished - the fangs shrank - and he turned back into a man. Simple, yet effective - and another village will remember me forever as the hero who delivered them from the monthly terror of werewolf attacks.\" The bell rang and Lockhart got to his feet. \"Homework - compose a poem about my defeat of the Wagga Wagga Werewolf! Signed copies of Magical Me to the author of the best one!\" The class began to leave. Harry returned to the back of the room, where Ron and Hermione were waiting. \"Ready?\" Harry muttered. \"Wait till everyone's gone,\" said Hermione nervously. \"All right . . . \" She approached Lockhart's desk, a piece of paper clutched tightly in her hand, Harry and Ron right behind her. \"Er - Professor Lockhart?\" Hermione stammered. \"I wanted to - to get this book out of the library. Just for background reading.\" She held out the piece of paper, her hand shaking slightly. \"But the thing is, it's in the Restricted Section of the library, so I need a teacher to 137 sign for it - I'm sure it would help me understand what you say in Gadding with Ghouls about slow-acting venoms \"Ah, Gadding with Ghouls!\" said Lockhart, taking the note from Hermione and smiling widely at her. \"Possibly my very favorite book. You enjoyed it?\" -162 \"Oh, yes,\" said Hermione eagerly. \"So clever, the way you trapped that last one with the tea-strainer -\" \"Well, I'm sure no one will mind me giving the best student of the year a little extra help,\" said Lockhart warmly, and he pulled out an enormous peacock quill. \"Yes, nice, isn't it?\" he said, misreading the revolted look on Ron's face. \"I usually save it for book-signings.\" He scrawled an enormous loopy signature on the note and handed it back to Hermione. \"So, Harry,\" said Lockhart, while Hermione folded the note with fumbling fingers and slipped it into her bag. \"Tomorrow's the first Quidditch match of the season, I believe? Gryffindor against Slytherin, is it not? I hear you're a useful player. I was a Seeker, too. I was asked to try for the National Squad, but preferred to dedicate my life to the eradication of the Dark Forces. Still, if ever you feel the need for a little private training, don't hesitate to ask. Always happy to pass on my expertise to less able players ...... Harry made an indistinct noise in his throat and then hurried off after Ron and Hermione. \"I don't believe it,\" he said as the three of them examined the signature on the note. \"He didn't even look at the book we wanted.\" \"That's because he's a brainless git,\" said Ron. \"But who cares, we've got what we needed -\" \"He is not a brainless git,\" said Hermione shrilly as they half ran toward the library. \"Just because he said you were the best student of the year -\" 138 They dropped their voices as they entered the muffled stillness of the library. Madam Pince, the librarian, was a thin, irritable woman who looked like an underfed vulture. *163* \"Moste Potente Potions?\" she repeated suspiciously, trying to take the note from Hermione; but Hermione wouldn't let go. \"I was wondering if I could keep it,\" she said breathlessly. \"Oh, come on,\" said Ron, wrenching it from her grasp and thrusting it at Madam Pince. \"We'll get you another autograph. Lockhart'll sign anything if it stands still long enough.\" Madam Pince held the note up to the light, as though determined to detect a forgery, but it passed the test. She stalked away between the lofty shelves and returned several minutes later carrying a large and moldy-looking book. Hermione put it carefully into her bag and they left, trying not to walk too quickly or look too guilty. Five minutes later, they were barricaded in Moaning Myrtle's out-oforder bathroom once again. Hermione had overridden Ron's objections by pointing out that it was the last place anyone in their right minds would go, so they were guaranteed some privacy. Moaning Myrtle was crying noisily in her stall, but they were ignoring her, and she them. Hermione opened Moste Potente Potions carefully, and the three of them bent over the damp-spotted pages. It was clear from a glance why it belonged in the Restricted Section. Some of the potions had effects almost too gruesome to think about, and there were some very unpleasant illustrations, which included a man who seemed to have been turned inside out and a witch sprouting several extra pairs of arms out of her head. \"Here it is,\" said Hermione excitedly as she found the page headed The Polyjuice Potion. It was decorated with drawings of people halfway through transforming into other people. Harry sin *164* 139 cerely hoped the artist had imagined the looks of intense pain on their faces. \"This is the most complicated potion I've ever seen,\" said Hermione as they scanned the recipe. \"Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed, and knotgrass,\" she murmured, running her finger down the list of ingredients. \"Well, they're easy enough, they're in the student storecupboard, we can help ourselves .... Oooh, look, powdered horn of a bicorn - don't know where we're going to get that - shredded skin of a boomslang -. that'll be tricky, too and of course a bit of whoever we want to change into.\" \"Excuse me?\" said Ron sharply. \"What d'you mean, a bit of whoever we're changing into? I'm drinking nothing with Crabbe's toenails in it -\" Hermione continued as though she hadn't heard him. \"We don't have to worry about that yet, though, because we add those bits last ...... Ron turned, speechless, to Harry, who had another worry. \"D'you realize how much we're going to have to steal, Hermione? Shredded skin of a boomslang, that's definitely not in the students' cupboard. What're we going to do, break into Snape's private stores? I don't know if this is a good idea ...... Hermione shut the book with a snap. \"Well, if you two are going to chicken out, fine,\" she said. There were bright pink patches on her cheeks and her eyes were brighter than usual. \"I don't want to break rules, you know. I think threatening Muggle-borns is far worse than brewing up a difficult potion. But if you don't want to find out if it's Malfoy, I'll go straight to Madam Pince now and hand the book back in =' *165 \"I never thought Id see the day when you'd be persuading us to break rules,\" said Ron. \"All right, we'll do it. But not toenails, okay?\" 140 \"How long will it take to make, anyway?\" said Harry as Hermione, looking happier, opened the book again. \"Well, since the fluxweed has got to be picked at the full moon and the lacewings have got to be stewed for twenty-one days ... I'd say it'd be ready in about a month, if we can get all the ingredients.\" \"A month?\" said Ron. \"Malfoy could have attacked half the Muggleborns in the school by then!\" But Hermione's eyes narrowed dangerously again, and he added swiftly, \"But it's the best plan we've got, so full steam ahead, I say.\" However, while Hermione was checking that the coast was clear for them to leave the bathroom, Ron muttered to Harry, \"It'll be a lot less hassle if you can just knock Malfoy off his broom tomorrow. Harry woke early on Saturday morning and lay for a while thinking about the coming Quidditch match. He was nervous, mainly at the thought of what Wood would say if Gryffindor lost, but also at the idea of facing a team mounted on the fastest racing brooms gold could buy. He had never wanted to beat Slytherin so badly. After half an hour of lying there with his insides churning, he got up, dressed, and went down to breakfast early, where he found the rest of the Gryffindor team huddled at the long, empty table, all looking uptight and not speaking much. As eleven o'clock approached, the whole school started to make its way down to the Quidditch stadium. It was a muggy sort of day *166* with a hint of thunder in the air. Ron and Hermione came hurrying over to wish Harry good luck as he entered the locker rooms. The team pulled on their scarlet Gryffindor robes, then sat down to listen to Wood's usual pre-match pep talk. \"Slytherin has better brooms than us,\" he began. \"No point denying it. But we've got better people on our brooms. We've trained harder than they have, we've been flying in all weathers -\" (\"Too true,\" muttered George Weasley. \"I haven't been properly dry since August\") \"- and we're going to make them rue the day they let that little bit of slime, Malfoy, buy his way onto their team.\" 141 Chest heaving with emotion, Wood turned to Harry. \"It'll be down to you, Harry, to show them that a Seeker has to have something more than a rich father. Get to that Snitch before Malfoy or die trying, Harry, because we've got to win today, we've got to.\" \"So no pressure, Harry\" said Fred, winking at him. As they walked out onto the pitch, a roar of noise greeted them; mainly cheers, because Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were anxious to see Slytherin beaten, but the Slytherins in the crowd made their boos and hisses heard, too. Madam Hooch, the Quidditch teacher, asked Flint and Wood to shake hands, which they did, giving each other threatening stares and gripping rather harder than was necessary. \"On my whistle,\" said Madam Hooch. \"Three ... two ... one. . . With a roar from the crowd to speed them upward, the fourteen players rose toward the leaden sky. Harry flew higher than any of them, squinting around for the Snitch. *167* \"All right there, Scarhead?\" yelled Malfoy, shooting underneath him as though to show off the speed of his broom. Harry had no time to reply. At that very moment, a heavy black Bludger came pelting toward him; he avoided it so narrowly that he felt it ruffle his hair as it passed. \"Close one, Harry!\" said George, streaking past him with his club in his hand, ready to knock the Bludger back toward a Slytherin. Harry saw George give the Bludger a powerful whack in the direction of Adrian Pucey, but the Bludger changed direction in midair and shot straight for Harry again. Harry dropped quickly to avoid it, and George managed to hit it hard toward Malfoy. Once again, the Bludger swerved like a boomerang and shot at Harry's head. Harry put on a burst of speed and zoomed toward the other end of the 142 pitch. He could hear the Bludger whistling along behind him. What was going on? Bludgers never concentrated on one player like this; it was their job to try and unseat as many people as possible .... Fred Weasley was waiting for the Bludger at the other end. Harry ducked as Fred swung at the Bludger with all his might; the Bludger was knocked off course. \"Gotcha!\" Fred yelled happily, but he was wrong; as though it was magnetically attracted to Harry, the Bludger pelted after him once more and Harry was forced to fly off at full speed. It had started to rain; Harry felt heavy drops fall onto his face, splattering onto his glasses. He didn't have a clue what was going on in the rest of the game until he heard Lee Jordan, who was commentating, say, \"Slytherin lead, sixty points to zero =' *168* The Slytherins' superior brooms were clearly doing their jobs, and meanwhile the mad Bludger was doing all it could to knock Harry out of the air. Fred and George were now flying so close to him on either side that Harry could see nothing at all except their flailing arms and had no chance to look for the Snitch, let alone catch it. \"Someone's - tampered - with - this - Bludger -\" Fred grunted, swinging his bat with all his might at it as it launched a new attack on Harry. \"We need time out,\" said George, trying to signal to Wood and stop the Bludger breaking Harry's nose at the same time. Wood had obviously got the message. Madam Hooch's whistle rang out and Harry, Fred, and George dived for the ground, still trying to avoid the mad Bludger. \"What's going on?\" said Wood as the Gryffindor team huddled together, while Slytherins in the crowd jeered. \"We're being flattened. Fred, George, where were you when that Bludger stopped Angelina scoring?\" \"We were twenty feet above her, stopping the other Bludger from 143 murdering Harry, Oliver,\" said George angrily. \"Someone's fixed it - it won't leave Harry alone. It hasn't gone for anyone else all game. The Slytherins must have done something to it.\" \"But the Bludgers have been locked in Madam Hooch's office since our last practice, and there was nothing wrong with them then . . . . \" said Wood, anxiously. Madam Hooch was walking toward them. Over her shoulder, Harry could see the Slytherin team jeering and pointing in his direction. 169 \"Listen,\" said Harry as she came nearer and nearer, \"with you two flying around me all the time the only way I'm going to catch the Snitch is if it flies up my sleeve. Go back to the rest of the team and let me deal with the rogue one.\" \"Don't be thick,\" said Fred. \"It'll take your head off.\" Wood was looking from Harry to the Weasleys. (I Oliver, this is insane,\" said Alicia Spinner angrily. \"You can't let Harry deal with that thing on his own. Let's ask for an inquiry -)) \"If we stop now, we'll have to forfeit the match!\" said Harry. \"And we're not losing to Slytherin just because of a crazy Bludger! Come on, Oliver, tell them to leave me alone!\" \"This is all your fault,\" George said angrily to Wood. \" `Get the Snitch or die trying,' what a stupid thing to tell him -\" Madam Hooch had joined them. \"Ready to resume play?\" she asked Wood. Wood looked at the determined look on Harry's face. \"All right,\" he said. \"Fred, George, you heard Harry -leave him alone and let him deal with the Bludger on his own.\" The rain was falling more heavily now. On Madam Hooch's whistle, 144 Harry kicked hard into the air and heard the telltale whoosh of the Bludger behind him. Higher and higher Harry climbed; he looped and swooped, spiraled, zigzagged, and rolled. Slightly dizzy, he nevertheless kept his eyes wide open, rain was speckling his glasses and ran up his nostrils as he hung upside down, avoiding another fierce dive from the Bludger. He could hear laughter from the crowd; he knew he must look very stupid, but the rogue Bludger was heavy and couldn't change direction as quickly as Harry could; he began a kind of roller-coaster ride around the *170* edges of the stadium, squinting through the silver sheets of rain to the Gryffindor goal posts, where Adrian Pucey was trying to get past Wood A whistling in Harry's ear told him the Bludger had just missed him again; he turned right over and sped in the opposite direction. \"Training for the ballet, Potter?\" yelled Malfoy as Harry was forced to do a stupid kind of twirl in midair to dodge the Bludger, and he fled, the Bludger trailing a few feet behind him; and then, glaring back at Malfoy in hatred, he saw it - the Golden Snitch. It was hovering inches above Malfoy's left ear - and Malfoy, busy laughing at Harry, hadn't seen it. For an agonizing moment, Harry hung in midair, not daring to speed toward Malfoy in case he looked up and saw the Snitch. WHAM. He had stayed still a second too long. The Bludger had hit him at last, smashed into his elbow, and Harry felt his arm break. Dimly, dazed by the searing pain in his arm, he slid sideways on his rain-drenched broom, one knee still crooked over it, his right arm dangling useless at his side - the Bludger came pelting back for a second attack, this time W-ming at his face - Harry swerved out of the way, one idea firmly lodged in his numb brain: get to Malfoy. Through a haze of rain and pain he dived for the shimmering, sneering face below him and saw its eyes widen with fear: Malfoy thought Harry was attacking him. 145 \"What the -\" he gasped, careening out of Harry's way. Harry took his remaining hand off his broom and made a wild snatch; he felt his fingers close on the cold Snitch but was now only *171* gripping the broom with his legs, and there was a yell from the crowd below as he headed straight for the ground, trying hard not to pass out. With a splattering thud he hit the mud and rolled off his broom. His arm was hanging at a very strange angle; riddled with pain, he heard, as though from a distance, a good deal of whistling and shouting. He focused on the Snitch clutched in his good hand. \"Aha,\" he said vaguely. \"We've won.\" And he fainted. He came around, rain falling on his face, still lying on the field, with someone leaning over him. He saw a glitter of teeth. \"Oh, no, not you,\" he moaned. \"Doesn't know what he's saying,\" said Lockhart loudly to the anxious crowd of Gryffindors pressing around them. \"Not to worry, Harry. I'm about to fix your arm.\" \"No!\"said Harry. \"I'll keep it like this, thanks ...... He tried to sit up, but the pain was terrible. He heard a familiar clicking noise nearby. \"I don't want a photo of this, Colin,\" he said loudly. \"Lie back, Harry,\" said Lockhart soothingly. \"It's a simple charm I've used countless times -\" \"Why can't I just go to the hospital wing?\" said Harry through clenched teeth. 146 \"He should really, Professor,\" said a muddy Wood, who couldn't help grinning even though his Seeker was injured. \"Great capture, Harry, really spectacular, your best yet, Id say -\" Through the thicket of legs around him, Harry spotted Fred and *112* George Weasley, wrestling the rogue Bludger into a box. It was still putting up a terrific fight. \"Stand back,\" said Lockhart, who was rolling up his jade-green sleeves. \"No - don't -\" said Harry weakly, but Lockhart was twirling his wand and a second later had directed it straight at Harry's arm. A strange and unpleasant sensation started at Harry's shoulder and spread all the way down to his fingertips. It felt as though his arm was being deflated. He didn't dare look at what was happening. He had shut his eyes, his face turned away from his arm, but his worst fears were realized as the people above him gasped and Colin Creevey began clicking away madly. His arm didn't hurt anymore - nor did it feel remotely like an arm. \"Ah,\" said Lockhart. \"Yes. Well, that can sometimes happen. But the point is, the bones are no longer broken. That's the thing to bear in mind. So, Harry, just toddle up to the hospital wing - ah, Mr. Weasley, Miss Granger, would you escort him? - and Madam Pomfrey will be able to - er - tidy you up a bit.\" As Harry got to his feet, he felt strangely lopsided. Taking a deep breath he looked down at his right side. What he saw nearly made him pass out again. Poking out of the end of his robes was what looked like a thick, fleshcolored rubber glove. He tried to move his fingers. Nothing happened. Lockhart hadn't mended Harry's bones. He had removed them. Madam Pomfrey wasn't at all pleased. 147 \"You should have come straight to me!\" she raged, holding up *173* the sad, limp remainder of what, half an hour before, had been a working arm. \"I can mend bones in a second - but growing them back - \" \"You will be able to, won't you?\" said Harry desperately. \"I'll be able to, certainly, but it will be painful,\" said Madam Pomfrey grimly, throwing Harry a pair of pajamas. \"You'll have to stay the night ...... Hermione waited outside the curtain drawn around Harry's bed while Ron helped him into his pajamas. It took a while to stuff the rubbery, boneless arm into a sleeve. \"How can you stick up for Lockhart now, Hermione, eh?\" Ron called through the curtain as he pulled Harry's limp fingers through the cuff. \"If Harry had wanted deboning he would have asked.\" \"Anyone can make a mistake,\" said Hermione. \"And it doesn't hurt anymore, does it, Harry?\" \"No,\" said Harry, getting into bed. \"But it doesn't do anything else either.\" As he swung himself onto the bed, his arm flapped pointlessly. Hermione and Madam Pomfrey came around the curtain. Madam Pomfrey was holding a large bottle of something labeled Skele-Gro. \"You're in for a rough night,\" she said, pouring out a steaming beakerful and handing it to him. \"Regrowing bones is a nasty business. So was taking the Skele-Gro. It burned Harry's mouth and throat as it went down, making him cough and splutter. Still tut-tutting about dangerous sports and inept teachers, Madam Pomfrey re *114* 148 treated, leaving Ron and Hermione to help Harry gulp down some water. \"We won, though,\" said Ron, a grin breaking across his face. \"That was some catch you made. Malfoy's face ... he looked ready to kill ...... \"I want to know how he fixed that Bludger,\" said Hermione darkly. \"We can add that to the list of questions we'll ask him when we've taken the Polyjuice Potion,\" said Harry, sinking back onto his pillows. \"I hope it tastes better than this stuff ..... \"If it's got bits of Slytherins in it? You've got to be joking,\" said Ron. The door of the hospital wing burst open at that moment. Filthy and soaking wet, the rest of the Gryffindor team had arrived to see Harry. \"Unbelievable flying, Harry,\" said George. \"I've just seen Mar cus Flint yelling at Malfoy. Something about having the Snitch on top of his head and not noticing. Malfoy didn't seem too happy.\" They had brought cakes, sweets, and bottles of pumpkin juice; they gathered around Harry's bed and were just getting started on what promised to be a good party when Madam Pomfrey came storming over, shouting, \"This boy needs rest, he's got thirty-three bones to regrow! Out! OUT!\" And Harry was left alone, with nothing to distract him from the stabbing pains in his limp arm. Hours and hours later, Harry woke quite suddenly in the pitch blackness and gave a small yelp of pain: His arm now felt full of large splinters. For a second, he thought that was what had woken him. Then, with a thrill of horror, he realized that someone was sponging his forehead in the dark. \"Get off!\" he said loudly, and then, \"Dobby!\" The house-elf's goggling tennis ball eyes were peering at Harry through the darkness. A single tear was running down his long, pointed nose. \"Harry Potter came back to school,\" he whispered miserably. 149 \"Dobby warned and warned Harry Potter. Ah sir, why didn't you heed Dobby? Why didn't Harry Potter go back home when he missed the train?\" Harry heaved himself up on his pillows and pushed Dobby's sponge away. \"What're you doing here?\" he said. \"And how did you know I missed the train?\" Dobby's lip trembled and Harry was seized by a sudden suspicion. \"It was you!\" he said slowly. \"You stopped the barrier from letting us through!\" \"Indeed yes, sir,\" said Dobby, nodding his head vigorously, ears flapping. \"Dobby hid and watched for Harry Potter and sealed the gateway and Dobby had to iron his hands afterward\" - he showed Harry ten long, bandaged fingers - \"but Dobby didn't care, sir, for he thought Harry Potter was safe, and never did Dobby dream that Harry Potter would get to school another way!\" He was rocking backward and forward, shaking his ugly head. \"Dobby was 'so shocked when he heard Harry Potter was back at Hogwarts, he let his master's dinner burn! Such a flogging Dobby never had, sir . ..... *176* Harry slumped back onto his pillows. \"You nearly got Ron and me expelled,\" he said fiercely. \"You'd better get lost before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you.\" Dobby smiled weakly. \"Dobby is used to death threats, sir. Dobby gets them five times a day at home.\" He blew his nose on a corner of the filthy pillowcase he wore, looking so pathetic that Harry felt his anger ebb away in spite of himself. 150 \"Why d'you wear that thing, Dobby?\" he asked curiously. \"This, sir?\" said Dobby, plucking at the pillowcase. \"'Tis a mark of the house-elf's enslavement, sir. Dobby can only be freed if his masters present him with clothes, sir. The family is careful not to pass Dobby even a sock, sir, for then he would be free to leave their house forever.\" Dobby mopped his bulging eyes and said suddenly, \"Harry Potter must go home! Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make -\" \"Your Bludger?\" said Harry, anger rising once more. \"What d'you mean, your Bludger? You made that Bludger try and kill me?\" \"Not kill you, sir, never kill you!\" said Dobby, shocked. \"Dobby wants to save Harry Potter's life! Better sent home, grievously injured, than remain here sir! Dobby only wanted Harry Potter hurt enough to be sent home!\" \"Oh, is that all?\" said Harry angrily. \"I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you wanted me sent home in pieces?\" \"Ah, if Harry Potter only knew!\" Dobby groaned, more tears dripping onto his ragged pillowcase. \"If he knew what he means *177* to us, to the lowly, the enslaved, we dregs of the magical world! Dobby remembers how it was when He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was at the height of his powers, sir! We house-elfs were treated like vermin, sir! Of course, Dobby is still treated like that, sir,\" he admitted, drying his face on the pillowcase. \"But mostly, sir, life has improved for my kind since you triumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Harry Potter survived, and the Dark Lord's power was broken, and it was a new dawn, sir, and Harry Potter shone like a beacon of hope for those of us who thought the Dark days would never end, sit... And now, at Hogwarts, terrible things are to happen, are perhaps happening already, and Dobby cannot let Harry Potter stay here now that history is to repeat itself, now that the Chamber of Secrets is open once more Dobby froze, horrorstruck, then grabbed Harry's water jug from his 151 bedside table and cracked it over his own head, toppling out of sight. A second later, he crawled back onto the bed, cross-eyed, muttering, \"Bad Dobby, very bad Dobby. . .\" \"So there is a Chamber of Secrets?\" Harry whispered. \"And did you say it's been opened before? Tell me, Dobby!\" He seized the elf's bony wrist as Dobby's hand inched toward the water jug. \"But I'm not Muggle-born - how can I be in danger from the Chamber?\" \"Ah, sir, ask no more, ask no more of poor Dobby,\" stammered the elf, his eyes huge in the dark. \"Dark deeds are planned in this place, but Harry Potter must not be here when they happen - go home, Harry Potter, go home. Harry Potter must not meddle in this, sir, 'tis too dangerous -\" \"Who is it, Dobby?\" Harry said, keeping a firm hold on Dobby's *178* wrist to stop him from hitting himself with the water jug again. \"Who's opened it? Who opened it last time?\" \"Dobby can't, sir, Dobby can't, Dobby mustn't tell!\" squealed the elf. \"Go home, Harry Potter, go home!\" \"I'm not going anywhere!\" said Harry fiercely. \"One of my best friends is Muggle-born; she'll be first in line if the Chamber really has been opened -\" \"Harry Potter risks his own life for his friends!\" moaned Dobby in a kind of miserable ecstasy. \"So noble! So valiant! But he must save himself, he must, Harry Potter must not -\" Dobby suddenly froze, his bat ears quivering. Harry heard it, too. There were footsteps coming down the passageway outside. \"Dobby must go!\" breathed the elf, terrified. There was a loud crack, and Harry's fist was suddenly clenched on thin air. He slumped back into bed, his eyes on the dark doorway to the hospital wing as the footsteps drew nearer. 152 Next moment, Dumbledore was backing into the dormitory, wearing a long woolly dressing gown and a nightcap. He was carrying one end of what looked like a statue. Professor McGonagall appeared a second later, carrying its feet. Together, they heaved it onto a bed. \"Get Madam Pomfrey,\" whispered Dumbledore, and Professor McGonagall hurried past the end of Harry's bed out of sight. Harry lay quite still, pretending to be asleep. He heard urgent voices, and then Professor McGonagall swept back into view, closely followed by Madam Pomfrey, who was pulling a cardigan on over her nightdress. He heard a sharp intake of breath. \"What happened?\" Madam Pomfrey whispered to Dumbledore, bending over the statue on the bed. *l79* \"Another attack,\" said Dumbledore. \"Minerva found him on the stairs. \"There was a bunch of grapes next to him,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"We think he was trying to sneak up here to visit Potter.\" Harry's stomach gave a horrible lurch. Slowly and carefully, he raised himself a few inches so he could look at the statue on the bed. A ray of moonlight lay across its staring face. It was Colin Creevey. His eyes were wide and his hands were stuck up in front of him, holding his camera. \"Petrified?\" whispered Madam Pomfrey. \"Yes,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"But I shudder to think ... If Albus hadn't been on the way downstairs for hot chocolate - who knows what might have -\" The three of them stared down at Colin. Then Dumbledore leaned forward and wrenched the camera out of Colin's rigid grip. \"You don't think he managed to get a picture of his attacker?\" said Professor McGonagall eagerly. 153 Dumbledore didn't answer. He opened the back of the camera. \"Good gracious!\" said Madam Pomfrey. A jet of steam had hissed out of the camera. Harry, three beds away, caught the acrid smell of burnt plastic. \"Melted,\" said Madam Pomfrey wonderingly. \"All melted...\" \"What does this mean, Albus?\" Professor McGonagall asked urgently. \"It means,\" said Dumbledore, \"that the Chamber of Secrets is indeed open again.\" Madam Pomfrey clapped a hand to her mouth. Professor McGonagall stared at Dumbledore. *180* \"But, Albus ... surely ... who?\" \"The question is not who,\" said Dumbledore, his eyes on Colin. \"The question is, how . . . .\" And from what Harry could see of Professor McGonagall's shad owy face, she didn't understand this any better than he did. C H-H A P T t R ELEVEN THE D-KJEL]ING C-L-IJIB Harry woke up on Sunday morning to find the dormitory blazing with winter sunlight and his arm reboned but very stiff. He sat up quickly and looked over at Colin's bed, but it had been blocked from view by the high curtains Harry had changed behind yesterday. Seeing that he was awake, Madam Pomfrey came bustling over with a breakfast tray and then began bending and stretching his arm and fingers. \"All in order,\" she said as he clumsily fed himself porridge lefthanded. \"When you've finished eating, you may leave.\" Harry dressed as quickly as he could and hurried off to Gryffindor Tower, desperate to tell Ron and Hermione about Colin and Dobby, 154 but they weren't there. Harry left to look for them, wondering where they could have got to and feeling slightly hurt that they weren't interested in whether he had his bones back or not. *182* As Harry passed the library, Percy Weasley strolled out of it, looking in far better spirits than last time they'd met. \"Oh, hello, Harry,\" he said. \"Excellent flying yesterday, really excellent. Gryffindor has just taken the lead for the House Cup you earned fifty points!\" \"You haven't seen Ron or Hermione, have you?\" said Harry. \"No, I haven't,\" said Percy, his smile fading. \"I hope Ron's not in another girls' toilet ..... Harry forced a laugh, watched Percy walk out of sight, and then headed straight for Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. He couldn't see why Ron and Hermione would be in there again, but after making sure that neither Filch nor any prefects were around, he opened the door and heard their voices coming from a locked stall. \"It's me,\" he said, closing the door behind him. There was a clunk, a splash, and a gasp from within the stall and he saw Hermione's eye peering through the keyhole. `Harry!\" she said. \"You gave us such a fright - come in how's your arm?\" \"Fine,\" said Harry, squeezing into the stall. An old cauldron was perched on the toilet, and a crackling from under the rim told Harry they had lit a fire beneath it. Conjuring up portable, waterproof fires was a speciality of Hermione's. \"We'd've come to meet you, but we decided to get started on the Polyjuice Potion,\" Ron explained as Harry, with difficulty, locked the stall again. \"We've decided this is the safest place to hide it.\" 155 Harry started to tell them about Colin, but Hermione interrupted. \"We already know - we heard Professor McGonagall telling Professor Flitwick this morning. That's why we decided we'd better get going -\" \"The sooner we get a confession out of Malfoy, the better,\" snarled Ron. \"D'you know what I think? He was in such a foul temper after the Quidditch match, he took it out on Colin.\" \"There's something else,\" said Harry, watching Hermione tearing bundles of knotgrass and throwing them into the potion. \"Dobby came to visit me in the middle of the night.\" Ron and Hermione looked up, amazed. Harry told them everything Dobby had told him - or hadn't told him. Hermione and Ron listened with their mouths open. \"The Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?\" Hermione said. \"This settles it,\" said Ron in a triumphant voice. \"Lucius Malfoy must've opened the Chamber when he was at school here and now he's told dear old Draco how to do it. It's obvious. Wish Dobby'd told you what kind of monster's in there, though. I want to know how come nobody's noticed it sneaking around the school.\" \"Maybe it can make itself invisible,\" said Hermione, prodding leeches to the bottom of the cauldron. \"Or maybe it can disguise itself - pretend to be a suit of armor or something - I've read about Chameleon Ghouls -\" \"You read too much, Hermione,\" said Ron, pouring dead lacewings on top of the leeches. He crumpled up the empty lacewing bag and looked at Harry. \"So Dobby stopped us from getting on the train and broke your arm He shook his head. \"You know what, Harry? If he doesn't stop trying to save your life he's going to kill you.\" *184* 156 The news that Colin Creevey had been attacked and was now lying as though dead in the hospital wing had spread through the entire school by Monday morning. The air was suddenly thick with rumor and suspicion. The first years were now moving around the castle in tight-knit groups, as though scared they would be attacked if they ventured forth alone. Ginny Weasley, who sat next to Colin Creevey in Charms, was distraught, but Harry felt that Fred and George were going the wrong way about cheering her up. They were taking turns covering themselves with fur or boils and jumping out at her from behind statues. They only stopped when Percy, apoplectic with rage, told them he was going to write to Mrs. Weasley and tell her Ginny was having nightmares. Meanwhile, hidden from the teachers, a roaring trade in talismans, amulets, and other protective devices was sweeping the school. Neville Longbottom bought a large, evil-smelling green onion, a pointed purple crystal, and a rotting newt tail before the other Gryffindor boys pointed out that he was in no danger; he was a pureblood, and therefore unlikely to be attacked. \"They went for Filch first,\" Neville said, his round face fearful. \"And everyone knows I'm almost a Squib.\" In the second week of December Professor McGonagall came around as usual, collecting names of those who would be staying at school for Christmas. Harry, Ron, and Hermione signed her list; they had heard that Malfoy was staying, which struck them as very suspicious. The holidays would be the perfect time to use the Polyjuice Potion and try to worm a confession out of him. Unfortunately, the potion was only half finished. They still * 3-85* needed the bicorn horn and the boomslang skin, and the only place they were going to get them was from Snape's private stores. Harry privately felt he'd rather face Slytherin's legendary monster than let Snape catch him robbing his office. 157 \"What we need,\" said Hermione briskly as Thursday afternoon's double Potions lesson loomed nearer, \"is a diversion. Then one of us can sneak into Snape's office and take what we need.\" Harry and Ron looked at her nervously. \"I think Id better do the actual stealing,\" Hermione continued in a matter-of-fact tone. \"You two will be expelled if you get into any more trouble, and I've got a clean record. So all you need to do is cause enough mayhem to keep Snape busy for five minutes or so. Harry smiled feebly. Deliberately causing mayhem in Snape's Potions class was about as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye. Potions lessons took place in one of the large dungeons. Thursday afternoon's lesson proceeded in the usual way. Twenty cauldrons stood steaming between the wooden desks, on which stood brass scales and jars of ingredients. Snape prowled through the fumes, making waspish remarks about the Gryffindors' work while the Slytherins sniggered appreciatively. Draco Malfoy, who was Snape's favorite student, kept flicking puffer-fish eyes at Ron and Harry, who knew that if they retaliated they would get detention faster than you could say \"Unfair.\" Harry's Swelling Solution was far too runny, but he had his mind on more important things. He was waiting for Hermione's signal, and he hardly listened as Snape paused to sneer at his watery *186* potion. When Snape turned and walked off to bully Neville, Hermione caught Harry's eye and nodded. Harry ducked swiftly down behind his cauldron, pulled one of Fred's Filibuster fireworks out of his pocket, and gave it a quick prod with his wand. The firework began to fizz and sputter. Knowing he had only seconds, Harry straightened up, took aim, and lobbed it into the air; it landed right on target in Goyle's cauldron. Goyle's potion exploded, showering the whole class. People shrieked as splashes of the Swelling Solution hit them. Malfoy got a faceful and his nose began to swell like a balloon; Goyle blundered around, his 158 hands over his eyes, which had expanded to the size of a dinner plate - Snape was trying to restore calm and find out what had happened. Through the confusion, Harry saw Hermione slip quietly into Snape's office. \"Silence! SILENCE!\" Snape roared. \"Anyone who has been splashed, come here for a Deflating Draft - when I find out who did this -\" Harry tried not to laugh as he watched Malfoy hurry forward, his head drooping with the weight of a nose like a small melon. As half the class lumbered up to Snape's desk, some weighted down with arms like clubs, others unable to talk through gigantic puffedup lips, Harry saw Hermione slide back into the dungeon, the front of her robes bulging. When everyone had taken a swig of antidote and the various swellings had subsided, Snape swept over to Goyle's cauldron and scooped out the twisted black remains of the firework. There was a sudden hush. *187* \"If I ever find out who threw this,\" Snape whispered, \"I shall make sure that person is expelled.\" Harry arranged his face into what he hoped was a puzzled expression. Snape was looking right at him, and the bell that rang ten minutes later could not have been more welcome. \"He knew it was me,\" Harry told Ron and Hermione as they hurried back to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. \"I could tell.\" Hermione threw the new ingredients into the cauldron and began to stir feverishly. \"It'll be ready in two weeks,\" she said happily. \"Snape can't prove it was you,\" said Ron reassuringly to Harry. \"What can he do?\" \"Knowing Snape, something foul,\" said Harry as the potion frothed and bubbled. 159 A week later, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were walking across the entrance hall when they saw a small knot of people gathered around the notice board, reading a piece of parchment that had just been pinned up. Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas beckoned them over, looking excited. \"They're starting a Dueling Club!\" said Seamus. \"First meeting tonight! I wouldn't mind dueling lessons; they might come in handy one of these days ...... \"What, you reckon Slytherin's monster can duel?\" said Ron, but he, too, read the sign with interest. \"Could be useful,\" he said to Harry and Hermione as they went into dinner. \"Shall we go?\" Harry and Hermione were all for it, so at eight o'clock that *188* evening they hurried back to the Great Hall. The long dining tables had vanished and a golden stage had appeared along one wall, lit by thousands of candles floating overhead. The ceiling was velvety black once more and most of the school seemed to be packed beneath it, all carrying their wands and looking excited. \"I wonder who'll be teaching us?\" said Hermione as they edged into the chattering crowd. \"Someone told me Flitwick was a dueling champion when he was young - maybe it'll be him.\" \"As long as it's not -\" Harry began, but he ended on a groan: Gilderoy Lockhart was walking onto the stage, resplendent in robes of deep plum and accompanied by none other than Snape, wearing his usual black. Lockhart waved an arm for silence and called ' \"Gather round, gather round! Can everyone see me? Can you all hear me? Excellent! \"Now, Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little dueling club, to train you all in case you ever need to defend yourselves as I myself have done on countless occasions - for full 160 details, see my published works. \"Let me introduce my assistant, Professor Snape,\" said Lockhart, flashing a wide smile. \"He tells me he knows a tiny little bit about dueling himself and has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration before we begin. Now, I don't want any of you youngsters to worry - you'll still have your Potions master when I'm through with him, never fear!\" \"Wouldn't it be good if they finished each other off?\" Ron muttered in Harry's ear. Snape's upper lip was curling. Harry wondered why Lockhart *189* was still smiling; if Snape had been looking at him like that he'd have been running as fast as he could in the opposite direction. Lockhart and Snape turned to face each other and bowed; at least, Lockhart did, with much twirling of his hands, whereas Snape jerked his head irritably. Then they raised their wands like swords in front of them. \"As you see, we are holding our wands in the accepted combative position,\" Lockhart told the silent crowd. \"On the count of three, we will cast our first spells. Neither of us will be aiming to kill, of course.\" \"I wouldn't bet on that,\" Harry murmured, watching Snape baring his teeth. \"One - two - three -\" Both of them swung their wands above their heads and pointed them at their opponent; Snape cried: \"Expelliarmus!\" There was a dazzling flash of scarlet light and Lockhart was blasted off his feet: He flew backward off the stage, smashed into the wall, and slid down it to sprawl on the floor. Malfoy and some of the other Slytherins cheered. Hermione was dancing on tiptoes. \"Do you think he's all right?\" she squealed through her fingers. 161 \"Who cares?\" said Harry and Ron together. Lockhart was getting unsteadily to his feet. His hat had fallen off and his wavy hair was standing on end. \"Well, there you have it!\" he said, tottering back onto the platform. \"That was a Disarming Charm - as you see, I've lost my wand - ah, thank you, Miss Brown - yes, an excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape, but if you don't mind my saying *190* so, it was very obvious what you were about to do. If I had wanted to stop you it would have been only too easy - however, I felt it would be instructive to let them see . . .\" Snape was looking murderous. Possibly Lockhart had noticed, because he said, \"Enough demonstrating! I'm going to come amongst you now and put you all into pairs. Professor Snape, if you'd like to help me -\" They moved through the crowd, matching up partners. Lockhart teamed Neville with Justin Finch-Fletchley, but Snape reached Harry and Ron first. \"Time to split up the dream team, I think,\" he sneered. \"Weasley, you can partner Finnigan. Potter -\" Harry moved automatically toward Hermione. \"I don't think so,\" said Snape, smiling coldly. \"Mr. Malfoy, come over here. Let's see what you make of the famous Potter. And you, Miss Granger - you can partner Miss Bulstrode.\" Malfoy strutted over, smirking. Behind him walked a Slytherin girl who reminded Harry of a picture he'd seen in Holidays with Hags. She was large and square and her heavy jaw jutted aggressively. Hermione gave her a weak smile that she did not return. \"Face your partners!\" called Lockhart, back on the platform. \"And bow!\" 162 Harry and Malfoy barely inclined their heads, not taking their eyes off each other. \"Wands at the ready!\" shouted Lockhart. \"When I count to three, cast your charms to disarm your opponents - only to disarm them - we don't want any accidents - one ... two ... three -\" *191* Harry swung his wand high, but Malfoy had already started on \"two\": His spell hit Harry so hard he felt as though he'd been hit over the head with a saucepan. He stumbled, but everything still seemed to be working, and wasting no more time, Harry pointed his wand straight at Malfoy and shouted, \"Rictusempra!\" A jet of silver light hit Malfoy in the stomach and he doubled up, wheezing. \"I said disarm only!\" Lockhart shouted in alarm over the heads of the battling crowd, as Malfoy sank to his knees; Harry had hit him with a Tickling Charm, and he could barely move for laughing. Harry hung back, with a vague feeling it would be unsporting to bewitch Malfoy while he was on the floor, but this was a mistake; gasping for breath, Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry's knees, choked, \"Tarantallegra!\" and the next second Harry's legs began to jerk around out of his control in a kind of quickstep. \"Stop! Stop!\" screamed Lockhart, but Snape took charge. \"Finite Incantatem!\" he shouted; Harry's feet stopped dancing, Malfoy stopped laughing, and they were able to look up. A haze of greenish smoke was hovering over the scene. Both Neville and Justin were lying on the floor, panting; Ron was holding up an ashen-faced Seamus, apologizing for whatever his broken wand had done; but Hermione and Millicent Bulstrode were still moving; Millicent had Hermione in a headlock and Hermione was whimpering in pain; both their wands lay forgotten on the floor. Harry leapt forward and pulled Millicent off. It was difficult: She was a lot bigger than he was. \"Dear, dear,\" said Lockhart, skittering through the crowd, looking at 163 the aftermath of the duels. \"Up you go, Macmillan .... *192* Careful there, Miss Fawcett .... Pinch it hard, it'll stop bleeding in a second, Boot \"I think Id better teach you how to block unfriendly spells,\" said Lockhart, standing flustered in the midst of the hall. He glanced at Snape, whose black eyes glinted, and looked quickly away. \"Let's have a volunteer pair - Longbottom and Finch-Fletchley, how about you -\" \"A bad idea, Professor Lockhart,\" said Snape, gliding over like a large and malevolent bat. \"Longbottom causes devastation with the simplest spells. We'll be sending what's left of Finch-Fletchley up to the hospital wing in a matchbox.\" Neville's round, pink face went pinker. \"How about Malfoy and Potter?\" said Snape with a twisted smile. \"Excellent idea!\" said Lockhart, gesturing Harry and Malfoy into the middle of the hall as the crowd backed away to give them room. \"Now, Harry,\" said Lockhart. \"When Draco points his wand at you, you do this.\" He raised his own wand, attempted a complicated sort of wiggling action, and dropped it. Snape smirked as Lockhart quickly picked it up, saying, \"Whoops -my wand is a little overexcited -\" Snape moved closer to Malfoy, bent down, and whispered something in his ear. Malfoy smirked, too. Harry looked up nervously at Lockhart and said, \"Professor, could you show me that blocking thing again?\" \"Scared?\" muttered Malfoy, so that Lockhart couldn't hear him. \"You wish,\" said Harry out of the corner of his mouth. Lockhart cuffed Harry merrily on the shoulder. \"Just do what I did, Harry!\" \"What, drop my wand?\" 164 But Lockhart wasn't listening. \"Three - two - one - go!\" he shouted. Malfoy raised his wand quickly and bellowed, \"Serpensortia!\" The end of his wand exploded. Harry watched, aghast, as a long black snake shot out of it, fell heavily onto the floor between them, and raised itself, ready to strike. There were screams as the crowd backed swiftly away, clearing the floor. \"Don't move, Potter,\" said Snape lazily, clearly enjoying the sight of Harry standing motionless, eye to eye with the angry snake. \"I'll get rid of it ...... \"Allow me!\" shouted Lockhart. He brandished his wand at the snake and there was a loud bang; the snake, instead of vanishing, flew ten feet into the air and fell back to the floor with a loud smack. Enraged, hissing furiously, it slithered straight toward Justin Finch-Fletchley and raised itself again, fangs exposed, poised to strike. Harry wasn't sure what made him do it. He wasn't even aware of deciding to do it. All he knew was that his legs were carrying him forward as though he was on casters and that he had shouted stupidly at the snake, \"Leave him alone!\" And miraculously - inexplicably - the snake slumped to the floor, docile as a thick, black garden hose, its eyes now on Harry. Harry felt the fear drain out of him. He knew the snake wouldn't attack anyone now, though how he knew it, he couldn't have explained. He looked up at Justin, grinning, expecting to see Justin looking *194* relieved, or puzzled, or even grateful - but certainly not angry and scared. \"What do you think you're playing at?\" he shouted, and before Harry could say anything, Justin had turned and stormed out of the hall. Snape stepped forward, waved his wand, and the snake vanished in a small puff of black smoke. Snape, too, was looking at Harry in an 165 unexpected way: It was a shrewd and calculating look, and Harry didn't like it. He was also dimly aware of an ominous muttering all around the walls. Then he felt a tugging on the back of his robes. \"Come on,\" said Rods voice in his ear. \"Move - come on -\" Ron steered him out of the hall, Hermione hurrying alongside them. As they went through the doors, the people on either side drew away as though they were frightened of catching something. Harry didn't have a clue what was going on, and neither Ron nor Hermione explained anything until they had dragged him all the way up to the empty Gryffindor common room. Then Ron pushed Harry into an armchair and said, \"You're a Parselmouth. Why didn't you tell us?\" \"I'm a what?\" said Harry. `A Parselmouth!\" said Ron. \"You can talk to snakes!\" \"I know,\" said Harry. \"I mean, that's only the second time I've ever done it. I accidentally set a boa constrictor on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once - long story - but it was telling me it had never seen Brazil and I sort of set it free without meaning to that was before I knew I was a wizard -\" \"A boa constrictor told you it had never seen Brazil?\" Ron repeated faintly. *195* \"So?\" said Harry. \"I bet loads of people here can do it.\" \"Oh, no they can't,\" said Ron. \"It's not a very common gift. Harry, this is bad.\" \"What's bad?\" said Harry, starting to feel quite angry. \"What's wrong with everyone? Listen, if I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin -\" \"Oh, that's what you said to it?\" \"What d'you mean? You were there - you heard me -\" \"I heard you speaking Parseltongue,\" said Ron. \"Snake language. You 166 could have been saying anything - no wonder Justin panicked, you sounded like you were egging the snake on or something - it was creepy, you know -\" Harry gaped at him. \"I spoke a different language? But - I didn't realize - how can I speak a language without knowing I can speak it?\" Ron shook his head. Both he and Hermione were looking as though someone had died. Harry couldn't see what was so terrible. \"D'you want to tell me what's wrong with stopping a massive snake biting off Justin's head?\" he said. \"What does it matter how I did it as long as Justin doesn't have to join the Headless Hunt?\" \"It matters,\" said Hermione, speaking at last in a hushed voice, \"because being able to talk to snakes was what Salazar Slytherin was famous for. That's why the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent.\" Harry's mouth fell open. \"Exactly,\" said Ron. \"And now the whole school's going to think you're his great-great-great-great-grandson or something -\" \"But I'm not,\" said Harry, with a panic he couldn't quite explain. \"You'll find that hard to prove,\" said Hermione. \"He lived about a thousand years ago; for all we know, you could be.\" * IL96 * Harry lay awake for hours that night. Through a gap in the curtains around his four-poster he watched snow starting to drift past the tower window and wondered . . . Could he be a descendant of Salazar Slithering? He didn't know anything about his father's family, after all. The Dursleys had always forbidden questions about his wizarding relatives. Quietly, Harry tried to say something in Parseltongue. The words wouldn't come. It seemed he had to be face-to-face with a snake to 167 do it. But I'm in Gryffindor, Harry thought. The Sorting Hat wouldn't have put me in here if I had Slytherin blood... Ah, said a nasty little voice in his brain, but the Sorting Hat wanted to put you in Slytherin, don't you remember? Harry turned over. He'd see Justin the next day in Herbology and he'd explain that he'd been calling the snake off, not egging it on, which (he thought angrily, pummeling his pillow) any fool should have realized. By next morning, however, the snow that had begun in the night had turned into a blizzard so thick that the last Herbology lesson of the term was canceled: Professor Sprout wanted to fit socks and scarves on the Mandrakes, a tricky operation she would entrust to no one else, now that it was so important for the Mandrakes to grow quickly and revive Mrs. Norris and Colin Creevey. Harry fretted about this next to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, while Ron and Hermione used their time off to play a game of wizard chess. \"For heaven's sake, Harry,\" said Hermione, exasperated, as one *197* of Ron's bishops wrestled her knight off his horse and dragged him off the board. \"Go and find Justin if it's so important to you.\" So Harry got up and left through the portrait hole, wondering where Justin might be. The castle was darker than it usually was in daytime because of the thick, swirling gray snow at every window. Shivering, Harry walked past classrooms where lessons were taking place, catching snatches of what was happening within. Professor McGonagall was shouting at someone who, by the sound of it, had turned his friend into a badger. Resisting the urge to take a look, Harry walked on by, thinking that Justin might be using his free time to catch up on some work, and deciding to check the library first. 168 A group of the Hufliepuffs who should have been in Herbology were indeed sitting at the back of the library, but they didn't seem to be working. Between the long lines of high bookshelves, Harry could see that their heads were close together and they were having what looked like an absorbing conversation. He couldn't see whether Justin was among them. He was walking toward them when something of what they were saying met his ears, and he paused to listen, hidden in the Invisibility section. \"So anyway,\" a stout boy was saying, \"I told Justin to hide up in our dormitory. I mean to say, if Potter's marked him down as his next victim, it's best if he keeps a low profile for a while. Of course, Justin's been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip to Potter he was Muggle-born. Justin actually told him he'd been down for Eton. That's not the kind of thing you bandy about with Slytherin's heir on the loose, is it?\" \"You definitely think it is Potter, then, Ernie?\" said a girl with blonde pigtails anxiously. 198 \"Hannah,\" said the stout boy solemnly, \"he's a Parselmouth. Everyone knows that's the mark of a Dark wizard. Have you ever heard of a decent one who could talk to snakes? They called Slytherin himself Serpent-tongue.\" There was some heavy murmuring at this, and Ernie went on, \"Remember what was written on the wall? Enemies of the Heir, Beware. Potter had some sort of run-in with Filch. Next thing we know, Flich's cat's attacked. That first year, Creevey, was annoying Potter at the Quidditch match, taking pictures of him while he was lying in the mud. Next thing we know - Creevey's been attacked.\" \"He always seems so nice, though,\" said Hannah uncertainly, \"and, well, he's the one who made You-Know-Who disappear. He can't be all bad, can he?\" Ernie lowered his voice mysteriously, the Hufflepuffs bent closer, and Harry edged nearer so that he could catch Ernie's words. \"No one knows how he survived that attack by You-Know-Who. I 169 mean to say, he was only a baby when it happened. He should have been blasted into smithereens. Only a really powerful Dark wizard could have survived a curse like that.\" He dropped his voice until it was barely more than a whisper, and said, \"That's probably why You- Know-Who wanted to kill him in the first place. Didn't want another Dark Lord competing with him. I wonder what other powers Potter's been hiding?\" Harry couldn't take anymore. Clearing his throat loudly, he stepped out from behind the bookshelves. If he hadn't been feeling so angry, he would have found the sight that greeted him funny: Every one of the Hufflepuffs looked as though they had been Petrified by the sight of him, and the color was draining out of Ernie's face. *199* \"Hello,\" said Harry. \"I'm looking for Justin Finch-Fletchley.\" The Hufepuffs' worst fears had clearly been confirmed. They all looked fearfully at Ernie. \"What do you want with him?\" said Ernie in a quavering voice. \"I wanted to tell him what really happened with that snake at the Dueling Club,\" said Harry. Ernie bit his white lips and then, taking a deep breath, said, \"We were all there. We saw what happened.\" \"Then you noticed that after I spoke to it, the snake backed off?\" said Harry. \"All I saw,\" said Ernie stubbornly, though he was trembling as he spoke, \"was you speaking Parseltongue and chasing the snake toward Justin. \" \"I didn't chase it at him!\" Harry said, his voice shaking with anger. \"It didn't even touch him!\" \"It was a very near miss,\" said Ernie. \"And in case you're getting ideas,\" he added hastily, \"I might tell you that you can trace my family back through nine generations of witches and warlocks and 170 my blood's as pure as anyone's, so -\" - cc I don't care what sort of blood you've got!\" said Harry fiercely. \"Why would I want to attack Muggle-borns?\" \"I've heard you hate those Muggles you live with,\" said Ernie swiftly. \"It's not possible to live with the Dursleys and not hate them,\" said Harry. \"Id like to see you try it.\" He turned on his heel and stormed out of the library, earning himself a reproving glare from Madam Pince, who was polishing the gilded cover of a large spellbook. *200* Harry blundered up the corridor, barely noticing where he was going, he was in such a fury. The result was that he walked into something very large and solid, which knocked him backward onto the floor. \"Oh, hello, Hagrid,\" Harry said, looking up. Hagrid's face was entirely hidden by a woolly, snow-covered balaclava, but it couldn't possibly be anyone else, as he filled most of the corridor in his moleskin overcoat. A dead rooster was hanging from one of his massive, gloved hands. \"All righ', Harry?\" he said, pulling up the balaclava so he could speak. \"Why aren't yeh in class?\" \"Canceled,\" said Harry, getting up. \"What're you doing in here?\" Hagrid held up the limp rooster. \"Second one killed this term,\" he explained. \"It's either foxes or a Blood-Suckin Bugbear, an' I need the Headmaster's permission ter put a charm around the hen coop.\" He peered more closely at Harry from under his thick, snowflecked eyebrows. \"Yeh sure yeh're all righ'? Yeh look all hot an' bothered -\" 171 Harry couldn't bring himself to repeat what Ernie and the rest of the Hufflepuffs had been saying about him. \"It's nothing,\" he said. \"Id better get going, Hagrid, it's Transfiguration next and I've got to pick up my books.\" He walked off, his mind still full of what Ernie had said about him. \"Justin's been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip to Potter he was Muggle-born ..... * 2 0 IL * Harry stamped up the stairs and turned along another corridor, which was particularly dark; the torches had been extinguished by a strong, icy draft that was blowing through a loose windowpane. He was halfway down the passage when he tripped headlong over something lying on the floor. He turned to squint at what he'd fallen over and felt as though his stomach had dissolved. Justin Finch-Fletchley was lying on the floor, rigid and cold, a look of shock frozen on his face, his eyes staring blankly at the ceiling. And that wasn't all. Next to him was another figure, the strangest sight Harry had ever seen. It was Nearly Headless Nick, no longer pearly-white and transparent, but black and smoky, floating immobile and horizontal, six inches off the floor. His head was half off and his face wore an expression of shock identical to Justin's. Harry got to his feet, his breathing fast and shallow, his heart doing a kind of drumroll against his ribs. He looked wildly up and down the deserted corridor and saw a line of spiders scuttling as fast as they could away from the bodies. The only sounds were the muffled voices of teachers from the classes on either side. He could run, and no one would ever know he had been there. But he couldn't just leave them lying here .... He had to get help .... Would anyone believe he hadn't had anything to do with this? 172 As he stood there, panicking, a door right next to him opened with a bang. Peeves the Poltergeist came shooting out. \"Why, it's potty wee Potter!\" cackled Peeves, knocking Harry's glasses askew as he bounced past him. \"What's Potter up to? Why's Potter lurking -\" *202* Peeves stopped, halfway through a midair somersault. Upside down, he spotted Justin and Nearly Headless Nick. He flipped the right way up, filled his lungs and, before Harry could stop him, screamed, \"ATTACK! ATTACK! ANOTHER ATTACK! NO MORTAL OR GHOST IS SAFE! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES! ATTAAAACK!\" Crash - crash - crash - door after door flew open along the corridor and people flooded out. For several long minutes, there was a scene of such confusion that Justin was in danger of being squashed and people kept standing in Nearly Headless Nick. Harry found himself pinned against the wall as the teachers shouted for quiet. Professor McGonagall came running, followed by her own class, one of whom still had black-and-white-striped hair. She used her wand to set off aloud bang, which restored silence, and ordered everyone back into their classes. No sooner had the scene cleared somewhat than Ernie the Hufflepuff arrived, panting, on the scene. \"Caught in the act!\" Ernie yelled, his face stark white, pointing his finger dramatically at Harry. \"That will do, Macmillan!\" said Professor McGonagall sharply. Peeves was bobbing overhead, now grinning wickedly, surveying the scene; Peeves always loved chaos. As the teachers bent over Justin and Nearly Headless Nick, examining them, Peeves broke into song: \"Oh, Potter, you rotter, oh, what have you done, You're killing off' students, you think it's good fun -\" \"That's enough Peeves!\" barked Professor McGonagall, and Peeves zoomed away backward, with his tongue out at Harry. 173 *203* Justin was carried up to the hospital wing by Professor Flitwick and Professor Sinistra of the Astronomy department, but nobody seemed to know what to do for Nearly Headless Nick. In the end, Professor McGonagall conjured a large fan out of thin air, which she gave to Ernie with instructions to waft Nearly Headless Nick up the stairs. This Ernie did, fanning Nick along like a silent black hovercraft. This left Harry and Professor McGonagall alone together. \"This way, Potter,\" she said. \"Professor,\" said Harry at once, \"I swear I didn't -\" \"This is out of my hands, Potter,\" said Professor McGonagall curtly. They marched in silence around a corner and she stopped before a large and extremely ugly stone gargoyle. \"Lemon drop!\" she said. This was evidently a password, because the gargoyle sprang suddenly to life and hopped aside as the wall behind him split in two. Even full of dread for what was coming, Harry couldn't fail to be amazed. Behind the wall was a spiral staircase that was moving smoothly upward, like an escalator. As he and Professor McGonagall stepped onto it, Harry heard the wall thud closed behind them. They rose upward in circles, higher and higher, until at last, slightly dizzy, Harry saw a gleaming oak door ahead, with a brass knocker in the shape of a griffin. He knew now where he was being taken. This must be where Dumbledore lived. *204* C I3 A P T V RR T W E I V THE POLYJUICE POTION hey stepped off the stone staircase at the top, and Professor McGonagall rapped on the door. It opened silently and they entered. Professor McGonagall told Harry to wait and left him there, alone. 174 Harry looked around. One thing was certain: of all the teachers' offices Harry had visited so far this year, Dumbledore's was by far the most interesting. If he hadn't been scared out of his wits that he was about to be thrown out of school, he would have been very pleased to have a chance to look around it. It was a large and beautiful circular room, full of funny little noises. A number of curious silver instruments stood on spindlelegged tables, whirring and emitting little puffs of smoke. The walls were covered with portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses, all of whom were snoozing gently in their frames. There was also an enormous, claw-footed desk, and, sitting on a shelf behind it, a shabby, tattered wizard's hat - the Sorting Hat. *205* Harry hesitated. He cast a wary eye around the sleeping witches and wizards on the walls. Surely it couldn't hurt if he took the hat down and tried it on again? Just to see ... just to make sure it had put him in the right House He walked quietly around the desk, lifted the hat from its shelf, and lowered it slowly onto his head. It was much too large and slipped down over his eyes, just as it had done the last time he'd put it on. Harry stared at the black inside of the hat, waiting. Then a small voice said in his ear, \"Bee in your bonnet, Harry Potter?\" \"Er, yes,\" Harry muttered. \"Er - sorry to bother you - I wanted to ask - \" \"You've been wondering whether I put you in the right House,\" said the hat smartly. \"Yes ... you were particularly difficult to place. But I stand by what I said before\" - Harry's heart leapt - \"you would have done well in Slytherin -\" Harry's stomach plummeted. He grabbed the point of the hat and pulled it off. It hung limply in his hand, grubby and faded. Harry pushed it back onto its shelf, feeling sick. 175 \"You're wrong,\" he said aloud to the still and silent hat. It didn't move. Harry backed away, watching it. Then a strange, gagging noise behind him made him wheel around. He wasn't alone after all. Standing on a golden perch behind the door was a decrepit-looking bird that resembled a half-plucked turkey. Harry stared at it and the bird looked balefully back, making its gagging noise again. Harry thought it looked very ill. Its eyes were dull and, even as Harry watched, a couple more feathers fell out of its tail. Harry was just thinking that all he needed was for Dumbledore's pet bird to die while he was alone in the office with it, when the bird burst into flames. Harry yelled in shock and backed away into the desk. He looked feverishly around in case there was a glass of water somewhere but couldn't see one; the bird, meanwhile, had become a fireball; it gave one loud shriek and next second there was nothing but a smouldering pile of ash on the floor. The office door opened. Dumbledore came in, looking very somber. \"Professor,\" Harry gasped. \"Your bird - I couldn't do anything - he just caught fire -\" To Harry's astonishment, Dumbledore smiled. \"About time, too,\" he said. \"He's been looking dreadful for days; I've been telling him to get a move on.\" He chuckled at the stunned look on Harry's face. \"Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. Phoenixes burst into flame when it is time for them to die and are reborn from the ashes. Watch him . . .\" Harry looked down in time to see a tiny, wrinkled, newborn bird poke its head out of the ashes. It was quite as ugly as the old one. \"It's a shame you had to see him on a Burning Day,\" said Dumbledore, seating himself behind his desk. \"He's really very handsome most of the time, wonderful red and gold plumage. Fascinating creatures, 176 phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, their tears have healing powers, and they make highly faithful pets.\" In the shock of Fawkes catching fire, Harry had forgotten what he was there for, but it all came back to him as Dumbledore settled himself in the high chair behind the desk and fixed Harry with his penetrating, light-blue stare. Before Dumbledore could speak another word, however, the door of the office flew open with an almighty bang and Hagrid burst in, a wild look in his eyes, his balaclava perched on top of his shaggy black head and the dead rooster still swinging from his hand. \"It wasn' Harry, Professor Dumbledore!\" said Hagrid urgently. \"I was talkin' ter him seconds before that kid was found, he never had time, sir - \" Dumbledore tried to say something, but Hagrid went ranting on, waving the rooster around in his agitation, sending feathers everywhere. \"- it can't've bin him, I'll swear it in front o' the Ministry o' Magic if I have to -\" \"Hagrid, I -\" \"- yeh've got the wrong boy, sir, I know Harry never =' \"Hagrid!\" said Dumbledore loudly. \"I do not think that Harry attacked those people.\" \"Oh,\" said Hagrid, the rooster falling limply at his side. \"Right. I'll wait outside then, Headmaster.\" And he stomped out looking embarrassed. \"You don't think it was me, Professor?\" Harry repeated hopefully as Dumbledore brushed rooster feathers off his desk. \"No, Harry, I don't,\" said Dumbledore, though his face was somber again. \"But I still want to talk to you.\" 177 Harry waited nervously while Dumbledore considered him, the tips of his long fingers together. *208* \"I must ask you, Harry, whether there is anything you'd like to tell me,\" he said gently. \"Anything at all.\" Harry didn't know what to say. He thought of Malfoy shouting, \"You'll be next, Mudbloods!\" and of the Polyjuice Potion simmering away in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. Then he thought of the disembodied voice he had heard twice and remembered what Ron had said: \"Hearing voices no one else can hear isn't a good sign, even in the wizarding world.\" He thought, too, about what everyone was saying about him, and his growing dread that he was somehow connected with Salazar Slytherin .... \"No,\" said Harry. \"There isn't anything, Professor . . . .\" The double attack on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick turned what had hitherto been nervousness into real panic. Curiously, it was Nearly Headless Nick's fate that seemed to worry people most. What could possibly do that to a ghost? people asked each other; what terrible power could harm someone who was already dead? There was almost a stampede to book seats on the Hogwarts Express so that students could go home for Christmas. \"At this rate, we'll be the only ones left,\" Ron told Harry and Hermione. \"Us, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle. What a jolly holiday it's going to be.\" Crabbe and Goyle, who always did whatever Malfoy did, had signed up to stay over the holidays, too. But Harry was glad that most people were leaving. He was tired of people skirting around him in the corridors, as though he was about to sprout fangs or spit poison; tired of all the muttering, pointing, and hissing as he passed. *209* Fred and George, however, found all this very funny. They went out of their way to march ahead of Harry down the corridors, shouting, 178 \"Make way for the Heir of Slytherin, seriously evil wizard coming through ...... Percy was deeply disapproving of this behavior. \"It is not a laughing matter,\" he said coldly. \"Oh, get out of the way, Percy,\" said Fred. \"Harry's in a hurry.\" \"Yeah, he's off to the Chamber of Secrets for a cup of tea with his fanged servant,\" said George, chortling. Ginny didn't find it amusing either. \"Oh, don't,\" she wailed every time Fred asked Harry loudly who he was planning to attack next, or when George pretended to ward Harry off with a large clove of garlic when they met. Harry didn't mind; it made him feel better that Fred and George, at least, thought the idea of his being Slytherin's heir was quite ludicrous. But their antics seemed to be aggravating Draco Malfoy, who looked increasingly sour each time he saw them at it. \"It's because he's bursting to say it's really him,\" said Ron knowingly. \"You know how he hates anyone beating him at anything, and you're getting all the credit for his dirty work.\" \"Not for long,\" said Hermione in a satisfied tone. \"The Polyjuice Potion's nearly ready. We'll be getting the truth out of him any day now.\" At last the term ended, and a silence deep as the snow on the grounds descended on the castle. Harry found it peaceful, rather than gloomy, and enjoyed the fact that he, Hermione, and the Weasleys had the run of Gryffindor Tower, which meant they could *210* play Exploding Snap loudly without bothering anyone, and practice dueling in private. Fred, George, and Ginny had chosen to stay at school rather than visit Bill in Egypt with Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. Percy, who disapproved of what he termed their childish behavior, 179 didn't spend much time in the Gryffindor common room. He had already told them pompously that he was only staying over Christmas because it was his duty as a prefect to support the teachers during this troubled time. Christmas morning dawned, cold and white. Harry and Ron, the only ones left in their dormitory, were woken very early by Hermione, who burst in, fully dressed and carrying presents for them both. \"Wake up,\" she said loudly, pulling back the curtains at the window. \"Hermione - you're not supposed to be in here -\" said Ron, shielding his eyes against the light. \"Merry Christmas to you, too,\" said Hermione, throwing him his present. \"I've been up for nearly an hour, adding more lacewings to the potion. It's ready.\" Harry sat up, suddenly wide awake. \"Are you sure?\" \"Positive,\" said Hermione, shifting Scabbers the rat so that she could sit down on the end of Ron's four-poster. \"If we're going to do it, I say it should be tonight.\" At that moment, Hedwig swooped into the room, carrying a very small package in her beak. \"Hello,\" said Harry happily as she landed on his bed. \"Are you speaking to me again?\" 211 She nibbled his ear in an affectionate sort of way, which was a far better present than the one that she had brought him, which turned out to be from the Dursleys. They had sent Harry a toothpick and a note telling him to find out whether he'd be able to stay at Hogwarts for the summer vacation, too. The rest of Harry's Christmas presents were far more satisfactory. Hagrid had sent him a large tin of treacle fudge, which Harry decided 180 to soften by the fire before eating; Ron had given him a book called Flying with the Cannons, a book of interesting facts about his favorite Quidditch team, and Hermione had bought him a luxury eagle-feather quill. Harry opened the last present to find a new, hand-knitted sweater from Mrs. Weasley and a large plum cake. He read her card with a fresh surge of guilt, thinking about Mr. Weasley's car (which hadn't been seen since its crash with the Whomping Willow), and the bout of rule-breaking he and Ron were planning next. No one, not even someone dreading taking Polyjuice Potion later, could fail to enjoy Christmas dinner at Hogwarts. The Great Hall looked magnificent. Not only were there a dozen frost-covered Christmas trees and thick streamers of holly and mistletoe crisscrossing the ceiling, but enchanted snow was falling, warm and dry, from the ceiling. Dumbledore led them in a few of his favorite carols, Hagrid booming more and more loudly with every goblet of eggnog he consumed. Percy, who hadn't noticed that Fred had bewitched his prefect badge so that it now read \"Pinhead,\" kept asking them all what they were sniggering at. Harry didn't even care that Draco Malfoy was making loud, snide remarks * 2:L2 * about his new sweater from the Slytherin table. With a bit of luck, Malfoy would be getting his comeuppance in a few hours' time. Harry and Ron had barely finished their third helpings of Christmas pudding when Hermione ushered them out of the hall to finalize their plans for the evening. \"We still need a bit of the people you're changing into,\" said Hermione matter-of-facdy, as though she were sending them to the supermarket for laundry detergent. \"And obviously, it'll be best if you can get something of Crabbe's and Goyle's; they're Malfoys best friends, he'll tell them anything. And we also need to make sure the real Crabbe and Goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogating him. \"I've got it all worked out,\" she went on smoothly, ignoring Harry's and Ron's stupefied faces. She held up two plump chocolate cakes. \"I've filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. All you have to do is 181 make sure Crabbe and Goyle find them. You know how greedy they are, they're bound to eat them. Once they're asleep, pull out a few of their hairs and hide them in a broom closet.\" Harry and Ron looked incredulously at each other. \"Hermione, I don't think -\" \"That could go seriously wrong -\" But Hermione had a steely glint in her eye not unlike the one Professor McGonagall sometimes had. \"The potion will be useless without Crabbe's and Goyle's hair,\" she said sternly. \"You do want to investigate Malfoy, don't you?\" \"Oh, all right, all right,\" said Harry. \"But what about you? Whose hair are you ripping out?\" *213* \"I've already got mine!\" said Hermione brightly, pulling a tiny bottle out of her pocket and showing them the single hair inside it. \"Remember Millicent Bulstrode wrestling with me at the Dueling Club? She left this on my robes when she was trying to strangle me! And she's gone home for Christmas - so I'll just have to tell the Slytherins I've decided to come back.\" When Hermione had bustled off to check on the Polyjuice Potion again, Ron turned to Harry with a doom-laden expression. \"Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go wrong?\" But to Harry's and Ron's utter amazement, stage one of the operation went just as smoothly as Hermione had said. They lurked in the deserted entrance hall after Christmas tea, waiting for Crabbe and Goyle who had remained alone at the Slytherin table, shoveling down fourth helpings of trifle. Harry had perched the chocolate cakes on the end of the banisters. When they spotted Crabbe and Goyle coming out of the Great Hall, Harry and Ron hid quickly behind a suit of armor next to the front door. 182 \"How thick can you get?\" Ron whispered ecstatically as Crabbe gleefully pointed out the cakes to Goyle and grabbed them. Grinning stupidly, they stuffed the cakes whole into their large mouths. For a moment, both of them chewed greedily, looks of triumph on their faces. Then, without the smallest change of expression, they both keeled over backward onto the floor. By far the hardest part was hiding them in the closet across the hall. Once they were safely stowed among the buckets and mops, Harry yanked out a couple of the bristles that covered Goyle's fore * _2 14 * head and Ron pulled out several of Crabbe's hairs. They also stole their shoes, because their own were far too small for Crabbe- and Goyle-size feet. Then, still stunned at what they had just done, they sprinted up to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. They could hardly see for the thick black smoke issuing from the stall in which Hermione was stirring the cauldron. Pulling their robes up over their faces, Harry and Ron knocked softly on the door. \"Hermione?\" They heard the scrape of the lock and Hermione emerged, shinyfaced and looking anxious. Behind her they heard the gloop gloop of the bubbling, glutinous potion. Three glass tumblers stood ready on the toilet seat. \"Did you get them?\" Hermione asked breathlessly. Harry showed her Goyle's hair. \"Good. And I sneaked these spare robes out of the laundry,\" Hermione said, holding up a small sack. \"You'll need bigger sizes once you're Crabbe and Goyle.\" The three of them stared into the cauldron. Close up, the potion looked like thick, dark mud, bubbling sluggishly. \"I'm sure I've done everything right,\" said Hermione, nervously 183 rereading the splotched page of Moste Potente Potions. \"It looks like the book says it should ... once we've drunk it, we'll have exactly an hour before we change back into ourselves.\" \"Now what?\" Ron whispered. \"We separate it into three glasses and add the hairs.\" Hermione ladled large dollops of the potion into each of the glasses. Then, her hand trembling, she shook Millicent Bulstrode's hair out of its bottle into the first glass. *215* The potion hissed loudly like a boiling kettle and frothed madly. A second later, it had turned a sick sort of yellow. \"Urgh - essence of Millicent Bulstrode,\" said Ron, eyeing it with loathing. \"Bet it tastes disgusting.\" \"Add yours, then,\" said Hermione. Harry dropped Goyle's hair into the middle glass and Ron put Crabbe's into the last one. Both glasses hissed and frothed: Goyle's turned the khaki color of a booger, Crabbe's a dark, murky brown. \"Hang on,\" said Harry as Ron and Hermione reached for their glasses. \"We'd better not all drink them in here .... Once we turn into Crabbe and Goyle we won't fit. And Millicent Bulstrode's no pixie. \"Good thinking,\" said Ron, unlocking the door. \"We'll take separate stalls.\" Careful not to spill a drop of his Polyjuice Potion, Harry slipped into the middle stall. \"Ready?\" he called. \"Ready,\" came Ron's and Hermione's voices. \"One - two - three -\" 184 Pinching his nose, Harry drank the potion down in two large gulps. It tasted like overcooked cabbage. Immediately, his insides started writhing as though he'd just swallowed live snakes - doubled up, he wondered whether he was going to be sick - then a burning sensation spread rapidly from his stomach to the very ends of his fingers and toes - next, bringing him gasping to all fours, came a horrible melting feeling, as the skin all over his body bubbled like hot wax - and before his eyes, his hands began to grow, the fingers thickened, the nails broadened, * 2116 * the knuckles were bulging like bolts -his shoulders stretched painfully and a prickling on his forehead told him that hair was creeping down toward his eyebrows - his robes ripped as his chest expanded like a barrel bursting its hoops - his feet were agony in shoes four sizes too small As suddenly as it had started, everything stopped. Harry lay facedown on the stone-cold floor, listening to Myrtle gurgling morosely in the end toilet. With difficulty, he kicked off his shoes and stood up. So this was what it felt like, being Goyle. His large hand trembling, he pulled off his old robes, which were hanging a foot above his ankles, pulled on the spare ones, and laced up Goyle's boatlike shoes. He reached up to brush his hair out of his eyes and met only the short growth of wiry bristles, low on his forehead. Then he realized that his glasses were clouding his eyes because Goyle obviously didn't need them - he took them off and called, \"Are you two okay?\" Goyle's low rasp of a voice issued from his mouth. \"Yeah,\" came the deep grunt of Crabbe from his right. Harry unlocked his door and stepped in front of the cracked mirror. Goyle stared back at him out of dull, deepset eyes. Harry scratched his ear. So did Goyle. Ron's door opened. They stared at each other. Except that he looked pale and shocked, Ron was indistinguishable from Crabbe, from the pudding-bowl haircut to the long, gorilla arms. \"This is unbelievable,\" said Ron, approaching the mirror and prodding 185 Crabbe's flat nose. \"Unbelievable. \" \"We'd better get going,\" said Harry, loosening the watch that was cutting into Goyle's thick wrist. \"We've still got to find out * 217* where the Slytherin common room is. I only hope we can find someone to follow. . .\" Ron, who had been gazing at Harry, said, \"You don't know how bizarre it is to see Goyle thinking.\" He banged on Hermione's door. \"C'mon, we need to go -\" A high-pitched voice answered him. \"I - I don't think I'm going to come after all. You go on without me. \"Hermione, we know Millicent Bulstrode's ugly, no one's going to know it's you -\" \"No - really - I don't think I'll come. You two hurry up, you re wasting time Harry looked at Ron, bewildered. \"That looks more like Goyle,\" said Ron. \"That's how he looks every time a teacher asks him a question.\" \"Hermione, are you okay?\" said Harry through the door. \"Fine - I'm fine - go on -\" Harry looked at his watch. Five of their precious sixty minutes had already passed. \"We'll meet you back here, all right?\" he said. Harry and Ron opened the door of the bathroom carefully, checked that the coast was clear, and set off. \"Don't swing your arms like that,\" Harry muttered to Ron. 186 \"Eh?\" \"Crabbe holds them sort of stiff . . . .\" \"How's this?\" \"Yeah, that's better . . . .\" They went down the marble staircase. All they needed now was *218* a Slytherin that they could follow to the Slytherin common room, but there was nobody around. \"Any ideas?\" muttered Harry. \"The Slytherins always come up to breakfast from over there,\" said Ron, nodding at the entrance to the dungeons. The words had barely left his mouth when a girl with long, curly hair emerged from the entrance. \"Excuse me,\" said Ron, hurrying up to her. \"We've forgotten the way to our common room.\" \"I beg your pardon?\" said the girl stiffly. \"Our common room? I'm a Ravenclaw.\" She walked away, looking suspiciously back at them. Harry and Ron hurried down the stone steps into the darkness, their footsteps echoing particularly loudly as Crabbe's and Goyle's huge feet hit the floor, feeling that this wasn't going to be as easy as they had hoped. The labyrinthine passages were deserted. They walked deeper and deeper under the school, constantly checking their watches to see how much time they had left. After a quarter of an hour, just when they were getting desperate, they heard a sudden movement ahead. \"Ha!\" said Ron excitedly. \"There's one of them now!\" 187 The figure was emerging from a side room. As they hurried nearer, however, their hearts sank. It wasn't a Slytherin, it was Percy. \"What're you doing down here?\" said Ron in surprise. Percy looked affronted. \"That,\" he said stiffly, \"is none of your business. It's Crabbe, isn't it?\" 2 19 \"Wh - oh, yeah,\" said Ron. \"Well, get off to your dormitories,\" said Percy sternly. \"It's not safe to go wandering around dark corridors these days.\" \"You are,\" Ron pointed out. \"I,\" said Percy, drawing himself up, \"am a prefect. Nothing's about to attack me.\" A voice suddenly echoed behind Harry and Ron. Draco Malfoy was strolling toward them, and for the first time in his life, Harry was pleased to see him. \"There you are,\" he drawled, looking at them. \"Have you two been pigging out in the Great Hall all this time? I've been looking for you; I want to show you something really funny.\" Malfoy glanced witheringly at Percy. \"And what're you doing down here, Weasley?\" he sneered. Percy looked outraged. \"You want to show a bit more respect to a school prefect!\" he said. \"I don't like your attitude!\" Malfoy sneered and motioned for Harry and Ron to follow him. Harry almost said something apologetic to Percy but caught himself just in time. He and Ron hurried after Malfoy, who said as they turned into 188 the next passage, \"That Peter Weasley -\" \"Percy,\" Ron corrected him automatically. \"Whatever,\" said Malfoy. \"I've noticed him sneaking around a lot lately. And I bet I know what he's up to. He thinks he's going to catch Slytherin's heir single-handed.\" He gave a short, derisive laugh. Harry and Ron exchanged excited looks. Malfoy paused by a stretch of bare, damp stone wall. * 220 * \"What's the new password again?\" he said to Harry. \"Er -\" said Harry. \"Oh, yeah -pure-blood!\" said Malfoy, not listening, and a stone door concealed in the wall slid open. Malfoy marched through it, and Harry and Ron followed him. The Slytherin common room was a long, low underground room with rough stone walls and ceiling from which round, greenish lamps were hanging on chains. A fire was crackling under an elaborately carved mantelpiece ahead of them, and several Slytherins were silhouetted around it in high-backed chairs. \"Wait here,\" said Malfoy to Harry and Ron, motioning them to a pair of empty chairs set back from the fire. \"I'll go and get it my father's just sent it to me -\" Wondering what Malfoy was going to show them, Harry and Ron sat down, doing their best to look at home. Malfoy came back a minute later, holding what looked like a newspaper clipping. He thrust it under Ron's nose. \"That'll give you a laugh,\" he said. Harry saw Ron's eyes widen in shock. He read the clipping quickly, 189 gave a very forced laugh, and handed it to Harry. It had been clipped out of the Daily Prophet, and it said: INQUIRY AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC Arthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office, was today fined fifty Galleons for bewitching a Muggle car. Mr. Lucius Malfoy, a governor of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where the 221 enchanted car crashed earlier this year, called today for Mr. Weasley's resignation. \"Weasley has brought the Ministry into disrepute,\" Mr. Malfoy told our reporter. \"He is clearly unfit to draw up our laws and his ridiculous Muggle Protection Act should be scrapped immediately.\" Mr. Weasley was unavailable for comment, although his wife told reporters to clear off or she'd set the family ghoul on them. \"Well?\" said Malfoy impatiently as Harry handed the clipping back to him. \"Don't you think it's funny?\" \"Ha, ha,\" said Harry bleakly. \"Arthur Weasley loves Muggles so much he should snap his wand in half and go and join them,\" said Malfoy scornfully. \"You'd never know the Weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they behave.\" Ron's - or rather, Crabbe's - face was contorted with fury. \"What's up with you, Crabbe?\" snapped Malfoy. \"Stomachache,\" Ron grunted. \"Well, go up to the hospital wing and give all those Mudbloods a kick from me,\" said Malfoy, snickering. \"You know, I'm surprised the Daily Prophet hasn't reported all these attacks yet,\" he went on thoughtfully. 190 \"I suppose Dumbledore's trying to hush it all up. He'll be sacked if it doesn't stop soon. Father's always said old Dumbledore's the worst thing that's ever happened to this place. He loves Muggle-borns. A decent headmaster would never've let slime like that Creevey in.\" *222* Malfoy started taking pictures with an imaginary camera and did a cruel but accurate impression of Colin: \"`Potter, can I have your picture, Potter? Can I have your autograph? Can I lick your shoes, please, Potter?\"' He dropped his hands and looked at Harry and Ron. \"What's the matter with you two?\" Far too late, Harry and Ron forced themselves to laugh, but Malfoy seemed satisfied; perhaps Crabbe and Goyle were always slow on the uptake. \"Saint Potter, the Mudbloods' friend,\" said Malfoy slowly. \"He's another one with no proper wizard feeling, or he wouldn't go around with that jumped up Granger Mudblood. And people think he's Slytherin's heir!\" Harry and Ron waited with bated breath: Malfoy was surely seconds away from telling them it was him - but then \"I wish I knew who it is,\" said Malfoy petulantly. \"I could help them.\" Ron's jaw dropped so that Crabbe looked even more clueless than usual. Fortunately, Malfoy didn't notice, and Harry, thinking fast, said, \"You must have some idea who's behind it all ...... \"You know I haven't, Goyle, how many times do I have to tell you?\" snapped Malfoy. \"And Father won't tell me anything about the last time the Chamber was opened either. Of course, it was fifty years ago, so it was before his time, but he knows all about it, and he says that it was all kept quiet and it'll look suspicious if I know too much about it. But I know one thing - last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. So I bet it's a matter of time before one of them's killed this time .... I hope it's Granger,\" he said with 191 relish. Ron was clenching Crabbe's gigantic fists. Feeling that it would be a bit of a giveaway if Ron punched Malfoy, Harry shot him a warning look and said, \"D'you know if the person who opened the Chamber last time was caught?\" \"Oh, yeah ... whoever it was was expelled,\" said Malfoy. \"They're probably still in Azkaban.\" \"Azkaban?\" said Harry, puzzled. \"Azkaban - the wizard prison, Goyle,\" said Malfoy, looking at him in disbelief \"Honestly, if you were any slower, you'd be going backward.\" He shifted restlessly in his chair and said, \"Father says to keep my head down and let the Heir of Slytherin get on with it. He says the school needs ridding of all the Mudblood filth, but not to get mixed up in it. Of course, he's got a lot on his plate at the moment. You know the Ministry of Magic raided our manor last week?\" Harry tried to force Goyle's dull face into a look of concern. \"Yeah. . .\" said Malfoy. \"Luckily, they didn't find much. Father's got some very valuable Dark Arts stuff. But luckily, we've got our own secret chamber under the drawing-room floor -\" \"Ho!\" said Ron. Malfoy looked at him. So did Harry. Ron blushed. Even his hair was turning red. His nose was also slowly lengthening - their hour was up, Ron was turning back into himself, and from the look of horror he was suddenly giving Harry, he must be, too. They both jumped to their feet. \"Medicine for my stomach,\" Ron grunted, and without further ado they sprinted the length of the Slytherin common room, hurled themselves at the stone wall, and dashed up the passage, hoping 192 against hope that Malfoy hadn't noticed anything. Harry 224 could feel his feet slipping around in Goyle's huge shoes and had to hoist up his robes as he shrank; they crashed up the steps into the dark entrance hall, which was full of a muffled pounding coming from the closet where they'd locked Crabbe and Goyle. Leaving their shoes outside the closet door, they sprinted in their socks up the marble staircase toward Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. \"Well, it wasn't a complete waste of time,\" Ron panted, closing the bathroom door behind them. \"I know we still haven't found out who's doing the attacks, but I'm going to write to Dad tomorrow and tell him to check under the Malfoys' drawing room.\" Harry checked his face in the cracked mirror. He was back to normal. He put his glasses on as Ron hammered on the door of Hermione's stall. \"Hermione, come out, we've got loads to tell you -\" \"Go away!\" Hermione squeaked. Harry and Ron looked at each other. \"What's the matter?\" said Ron. \"You must be back to normal by now, we are But Moaning Myrtle glided suddenly through the stall door. Harry had never seen her looking so happy. \"Ooooooh, wait till you see,\" she said. \"It's awful-\" They heard the lock slide back and Hermione emerged, sobbing, her robes pulled up over her head. \"What's up?\" said Ron uncertainly. \"Have you still got Millicent's nose or something?\" Hermione let her robes fall and Ron backed into the sink. 193 Her face was covered in black fur. Her eyes had turned yellow and there were long, pointed ears poking through her hair. \"It was a c-cat hair!\" she howled. \"M-Millicent Bulstrode *225* m-must have a cat! And the p-potion isn't supposed to be used for animal transformations!\" \"Uh-oh,\" said Ron. \"You'll be teased something dreadful,\" said Myrtle happily. \"It's okay, Hermione,\" said Harry quickly. \"We'll take you up to the hospital wing. Madam Pomfrey never asks too many questions ...... It took a long time to persuade Hermione to leave the bathroom. Moaning Myrtle sped them on their way with a hearty guffaw. \"Wait till everyone finds out you've got a tail!\" ermione remained in the hospital wing for several weeks. There was a flurry of rumor about her disappearance when the rest of the school arrived back from their Christmas holidays, because of course everyone thought that she had been attacked. So many students filed past the hospital wing trying to catch a glimpse of her that Madam Pomfrey took out her curtains again and placed them around Hermione's bed, to spare her the shame of being seen with a furry face. Harry and Ron went to visit her every evening. When the new term started, they brought her each day's homework. \"If Id sprouted whiskers, Id take a break from work,\" said Ron, tipping a stack of books onto Hermione's bedside table one evening. \"Don't be silly, Ron, I've got to keep up,\" said Hermione briskly. Her spirits were greatly improved by the fact that all the hair had * \"21 * 194 gone from her face and her eyes were turning slowly back to brown. \"I don't suppose you've got any new leads?\" she added in a whisper, so that Madam Pomfrey couldn't hear her. \"Nothing,\" said Harry gloomily. \"I was so sure it was Malfoy,\" said Ron, for about the hundredth time. \"What's that?\" asked Harry, pointing to something gold sticking out from under Hermione's pillow. \"Just a get well card,\" said Hermione hastily, trying to poke it out of sight, but Ron was too quick for her. He pulled it out, flicked it open, and read aloud: \"To Miss Granger, wishing you a speedy recovery, from your concerned teacher, Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-time winner of Witch Weekly's Most- Charming-Smile Award. \" Ron looked up at Hermione, disgusted. \"You sleep with this under your pillow?\" But Hermione was spared answering by Madam Pomfrey sweeping over with her evening dose of medicine. \"Is Lockhart the smarmiest bloke you've ever met, or what?\" Ron said to Harry as they left the infirmary and started up the stairs toward Gryffindor Tower. Snape had given them so much homework, Harry thought he was likely to be in the sixth year before he finished it. Ron was just saying he wished he had asked Hermione how many rat tails you were supposed to add to a HairRaising Potion when an angry outburst from the floor above reached their ears. \"That's Filch,\" Harry muttered as they hurried up the stairs and paused, out of sight, listening hard. * 228* 195 \"You don't think someone else's been attacked?\" said Ron tensely. They stood still, their heads inclined toward Flich's voice, which sounded quite hysterical. `= even more work for me! Mopping all night, like I haven't got enough to do! No, this is the final straw, I'm going to Dumbledore -\" His footsteps receded along the out-of-sight corridor and they heard a distant door slam. They poked their heads around the corner. Filch had clearly been manning his usual lookout post: They were once again on the spot where Mrs. Norris had been attacked. They saw at a glance what Filch had been shouting about. A great flood of water stretched over half the corridor, and it looked as though it was still seeping from under the door of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. Now that Filch had stopped shouting, they could hear Myrtle's wails echoing off the bathroom walls. \"Now what's up with her?\" said Ron. \"Let's go and see,\" said Harry, and holding their robes over their ankles they stepped through the great wash of water to the door bearing its OUT OF ORDER sign, ignored it as always, and entered. Moaning Myrtle was crying, if possible, louder and harder than ever before. She seemed to be hiding down her usual toilet. It was dark in the bathroom because the candles had been extinguished in the great rush of water that had left both walls and floor soaking wet. \"What's up, Myrtle?\" said Harry. \"Who's that?\" glugged Myrtle miserably. \"Come to throw something else at me?\" Harry waded across to her stall and said, \"Why would I throw something at you?\" *229* \"Don't ask me,\" Myrtle shouted, emerging with a wave of yet more 196 water, which splashed onto the already sopping floor. \"Here I am, minding my own business, and someone thinks it's funny to throw a book at me ...... \"But it can't hurt you if someone throws something at you,\" said Harry, reasonably. \"I mean, it'd just go right through you, wouldn't it?\" He had said the wrong thing. Myrtle puffed herself up and shrieked, \"Let's all throw books at Myrtle, because she can't feel it! Ten points if you can get it through her stomach! Fifty points if it goes through her head! Well, ha, ha, ha! What a lovely game, I don't think!\" \"Who threw it at you, anyway?\" asked Harry. \"I don't know... I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death, and it fell right through the top of my head,\" said Myrtle, glaring at them. \"It's over there, it got washed out ...... Harry and Ron looked under the sink where Myrtle was pointing. A small, thin book lay there. It had a shabby black cover and was as wet as everything else in the bathroom. Harry stepped forward to pick it up, but Ron suddenly flung out an arm to hold him back. \"What?\" said Harry. \"Are you crazy?\" said Ron. \"It could be dangerous.\" \"Dangerous?\"said Harry, laughing. \"Come off it, how could it be dangerous?\" \"You'd be surprised,\" said Ron, who was looking apprehensively at the book. \"Some of the books the Ministry's confiscated Dad's told me - there was one that burned your eyes out. And *2%0* everyone who read Sonnets of a Sorcerer spoke in limericks for the rest of their lives. And some old witch in Bath had a book that you could never stop reading! You just had to wander around with your nose in it, trying to do everything one-handed. And -\" 197 \"All right, I've got the point,\" said Harry. The little book lay on the floor, nondescript and soggy. \"Well, we won't find out unless we look at it,\" he said, and he ducked around Ron and picked it up off the floor. Harry saw at once that it was a diary, and the faded year on the cover told him it was fifty years old. He opened it eagerly. On the first page he could just make out the name \"T M. Riddle\" in smudged ink. \"Hang on,\" said Ron, who had approached cautiously and was looking over Harry's shoulder. \"I know that name .... T. M. Riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago.\" \"How on earth d'you know that?\" said Harry in amazement. \"Because Filch made me polish his shield about fifty times in detention,\" said Ron resentfully. \"That was the one I burped slugs all over. If you'd wiped slime off a name for an hour, you'd remember it, too.\" Harry peeled the wet pages apart. They were completely blank. There wasn't the faintest trace of writing on any of them, not even Auntie Mabel's birthday, or dentist, half-past three. \"He never wrote in it,\" said Harry, disappointed. \"I wonder why someone wanted to flush it away?\" said Ron curiously. Harry turned to the back cover of the book and saw the printed name of a variety store on Vauxhall Road, London. *231 * \"He must've been Muggle-born,\" said Harry thoughtfufly. \"To have bought a diary from Vauxhall Road ...... \"Well, it's not much use to you,\" said Ron. He dropped his voice. \"Fifty points if you can get it through Myrtle's nose.\" Harry, however, pocketed it. 198 Hermione left the hospital wing, de-whiskered, tail-less, and furfree, at the beginning of February. On her first evening back in Gryffindor Tower, Harry showed her T. M. Riddle's diary and told her the story of how they had found it. \"Oooh, it might have hidden powers,\" said Hermione enthusiastically, taking the diary and looking at it closely. \"If it has, it's hiding them very well,\" said Ron. \"Maybe it's shy. I don't know why you don't chuck it, Harry.\" \"I wish I knew why someone did try to chuck it,\" said Harry. \"I wouldn't mind knowing how Riddle got an award for special services to Hogwarts either.\" \"Could've been anything,\" said Ron. \"Maybe he got thirty O.WL.s or saved a teacher from the giant squid. Maybe he murdered Myrtle; that would've done everyone a favor ..... But Harry could tell from the arrested look on Hermione's face that she was thinking what he was thinking. \"What?\" said Ron, looking from one to the other. \"Well, the Chamber of Secrets was opened fifty years ago, wasn't it?\" he said. \"That's what Malfoy said.\" \"Yeah. . .\" said Ron slowly. \"And this diary is fifty years old,\" said Hermione, tapping it excitedly. *232* a so? . \"Oh, Ron, wake up,\" snapped Hermione. \"We know the person who opened the Chamber last time was expelled fifty years ago. We know T. M. Riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago. Well, what if Riddle got his special award for catching the Heir of 199 Slytherin? His diary would probably tell us everything - where the Chamber is, and how to open it, and what sort of creature lives in it - the person who's behind the attacks this time wouldn't want that lying around, would they?\" \"That's a brilliant theory, Hermione,\" said Ron, \"with just one tiny little flaw. There's nothing written in his diary.\" But Hermione was pulling her wand out of her bag. \"It might be invisible ink!\" she whispered. She tapped the diary three times and said, \"Aparecium!\" Nothing happened. Undaunted, Hermione shoved her hand back into her bag and pulled out what appeared to be a bright red eraser. \"It's a Revealer, I got it in Diagon Alley,\" she said. She rubbed hard on January first. Nothing happened. \"I'm telling you, there's nothing to find in there,\" said Ron. \"Riddle just got a diary for Christmas and couldn't be bothered filling it in.\" Harry couldn't explain, even to himself, why he didn't just throw Riddle's diary away. The fact was that even though he knew the diary was blank, he kept absentmindedly picking it up and turning the pages, as though it were a story he wanted to finish. And while Harry was sure he had never heard the name T. M. Riddle before, it still seemed to mean something to him, almost as though * 233 * Riddle was a friend he'd had when he was very small, and had halfforgotten. But this was absurd. He'd never had friends before Hogwarts, Dudley had made sure of that. Nevertheless, Harry was determined to find out more about Riddle, so next day at break, he headed for the trophy room to examine Riddle's special award, accompanied by an interested Hermione and a thoroughly unconvinced Ron, who told them he'd seen enough of the trophy room to last him a lifetime. 200 Riddle's burnished gold shield was tucked away in a corner cabinet. It didn't carry details of why it had been given to him (\"Good thing, too, or it'd be even bigger and Id still be polishing it,\" said Ron). However, they did find Riddle's name on an old Medal for Magical Merit, and on a list of old Head Boys. \"He sounds like Percy,\" said Ron, wrinkling his nose in disgust. \"Prefect, Head Boy ... probably top of every class -\" \"You say that like it's a bad thing,\" said Hermione in a slightly hurt voice. The sun had now begun to shine weakly on Hogwarts again. Inside the castle, the mood had grown more hopeful. There had been no more attacks since those on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick, and Madam Pomfrey was pleased to report that the Mandrakes were becoming moody and secretive, meaning that they were fast leaving childhood. \"The moment their acne clears up, they'll be ready for repotting again,\" Harry heard her telling Filch kindly one afternoon. \"And after that, it won't be long until we're cutting them up and stewing them. You'll have Mrs. Norris back in no time.\" * 243 * Perhaps the Heir of Slytherin had lost his or her nerve, thought Harry. It must be getting riskier and riskier to open the Chamber of Secrets, with the school so alert and suspicious. Perhaps the monster, whatever it was, was even now settling itself down to hibernate for another fifty years .... Ernie Macmillan of Hufflepuff didn't take this cheerful view. He was still convinced that Harry was the guilty one, that he had \"given himself away\" at the Dueling Club. Peeves wasn't helping matters; he kept popping up in the crowded corridors singing \"Oh, Potter, you rotter . . .\" now with a dance routine to match. Gilderoy Lockhart seemed to think he himself had made the attacks stop. Harry overheard him telling Professor McGonagall so while the Gryffindors were lining up for Transfiguration. 201 \"I don't think there'll be any more trouble, Minerva,\" he said, tapping his nose knowingly and winking. \"I think the Chamber has been locked for good this time. The culprit must have known it was only a matter of time before I caught him. Rather sensible to stop now, before I came down hard on him. \"You know, what the school needs now is a morale-booster. Wash away the memories of last term! I won't say any more just now, but I think I know just the thing . . . .\" He tapped his nose again and strode off. Lockhart's idea of a morale-booster became clear at breakfast time on February fourteenth. Harry hadn't had much sleep because of a laterunning Quidditch practice the night before, and he hurried down to the Great Hall, slightly late. He thought, for a moment, that he'd walked through the wrong doors. The walls were all covered with large, lurid pink flowers. Worse * 235* still, heart-shaped confetti was falling from the pale blue ceiling. Harry went over to the Gryffindor table, where Ron was sitting looking sickened, and Hermione seemed to have been overcome with giggles. \"What's going on?\" Harry asked them, sitting down and wiping confetti off his bacon. Ron pointed to the teachers' table, apparently too disgusted to speak. Lockhart, wearing lurid pink robes to match the decorations, was waving for silence. The teachers on either side of him were looking stony-faced. From where he sat, Harry could see a muscle going in Professor McGonagall's cheek. Snape looked as though someone had just fed him a large beaker of Skele-Gro. \"Happy Valentine's Day!\" Lockhart shouted. \"And may I thank the forty-six people who have so far sent me cards! Yes, I have taken the liberty of arranging this little surprise for you all - and it doesn't end here!\" 202 Lockhart clapped his hands and through the doors to the entrance hall marched a dozen surly-looking dwarfs. Not just any dwarfs, however. Lockhart had them all wearing golden wings and carrying harps. \"My friendly, card-carrying cupids!\" beamed Lockhart. \"They will be roving around the school today delivering your valentines! And the fun doesn't stop here! I'm sure my colleagues will want to enter into the spirit of the occasion! Why not ask Professor Snape to show you how to whip up a Love Potion! And while you're at it, Professor Flitwick knows more about Entrancing Enchantments than any wizard I've ever met, the sly old dog!\" Professor Flitwick buried his face in his hands. Snape was look * 236 ing as though the first person to ask him for a Love Potion would be force-fed poison. \"Please, Hermione, tell me you weren't one of the forty-six, 51 said Ron as they left the Great Hall for their first lesson. Hermione suddenly became very interested in searching her bag for her schedule and didn't answer. All day long, the dwarfs kept barging into their classes to deliver valentines, to the annoyance of the teachers, and late that afternoon as the Gryffindors were walking upstairs for Charms, one of the dwarfs caught up with Harry. \"Oy, you! 'Arty Potter!\" shouted a particularly grim-looking dwarf, elbowing people out of the way to get to Harry. Hot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a line of first years, which happened to include Ginny Weasley, Harry tried to escape. The dwarf, however, cut his way through the crowd by kicking people's shins, and reached him before he'd gone two paces. \"I've got a musical message to deliver to 'Arry Potter in person,\" he said, twanging his harp in a threatening sort of way. \"Not here,\" Harry hissed, trying to escape. 203 \"Stay still!\" grunted the dwarf, grabbing hold of Harry's bag and pulling him back. \"Let me go!\" Harry snarled, tugging. With a loud ripping noise, his bag split in two. His books, wand, parchment, and quill spilled onto the floor and his ink bottle smashed over everything. Harry scrambled around, trying to pick it all up before the dwarf started singing, causing something of a holdup in the corridor. *237* \"What's going on here?\" came the cold, drawling voice of Draco Malfoy. Harry started stuffing everything feverishly into his ripped bag, desperate to get away before Malfoy could hear his musical valentine. \"What's all this commotion?\" said another familiar voice as Percy Weasley arrived. Losing his head, Harry tried to make a run for it, but the dwarf seized him around the knees and brought him crashing to the floor. \"Right,\" he said, sitting on Harry's ankles. \"Here is your singing valentine: His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad, His hair is as dark as a blackboard. I wish he was mine, he's really divine, The hero who conquered the Dark Lord Harry would have given all the gold in Gringotts to evaporate on the spot. Trying valiantly to laugh along with everyone else, he got up, his feet numb from the weight of the dwarf, as Percy Weasley did his best to disperse the crowd, some of whom were crying with mirth. \"Off you go, off you go, the bell rang five minutes ago, off to class, now,\" he said, shooing some of the younger students away. \"And you, Malfoy-\" 204 Harry, glancing over, saw Malfoy stoop and snatch up something. Leering, he showed it to Crabbe and Goyle, and Harry realized that he'd got Riddle's diary. \"Give that back,\" said Harry quietly. \"Wonder what Potter's written in this?\" said Malfoy, who obvi * 238 ously hadn't noticed the year on the cover and thought he had Harry's own diary. A hush fell over the onlookers. Ginny was staring from the diary to Harry, looking terrified. \"Hand it over, Malfoy,\" said Percy sternly. \"When I've had a look,\" said Malfoy, waving the diary tauntingly at Harry. Percy said, \"As a school prefect -\" but Harry had lost his temper. He pulled out his wand and shouted, \"Expelliarmus!\" and just as Snape had disarmed Lockhart, so Malfoy found the diary shooting out of his hand into the air. Ron, grinning broadly, caught it. \"Harry!\" said Percy loudly. \"No magic in the corridors. I'll have to report this, you know!\" But Harry didn't care, he was one-up on Malfoy, and that was worth five points from Gryffindor any day. Malfoy was looking furious, and as Ginny passed him to enter her classroom, he yelled spitefully after her, \"I don't think Potter liked your valentine much!\" Ginny covered her face with her hands and ran into class. Snarling, Ron pulled out his wand, too, but Harry pulled him away. Ron didn't need to spend the whole of Charms belching slugs. It wasn't until they had reached Professor Flitwick's class that Harry noticed something rather odd about Riddle's diary. All his other books were drenched in scarlet ink. The diary, however, was as clean as it had been before the ink bottle had smashed all over it. He tried to point this out to Ron, but Ron was having trouble with his 205 wand again; large purple bubbles were blossoming out of the end, and he wasn't much interested in anything else. Harry went to bed before anyone else in his dormitory that night. This was partly because he didn't think he could stand Fred and George singing, \"His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad\" one more time, and partly because he wanted to examine Riddle's diary again, and knew that Ron thought he was wasting his time. Harry sat on his four-poster and flicked through the blank pages, not one of which had a trace of scarlet ink on it. Then he pulled a new bottle out of his bedside cabinet, dipped his quill into it, and dropped a blot onto the first page of the diary. The ink shone brightly on the paper for a second and then, as though it was being sucked into the page, vanished. Excited, Harry loaded up his quill a second time and wrote, \"My name is Harry Potter.\" The words shone momentarily on the page and they, too, sank without trace. Then, at last, something happened. Oozing back out of the page, in his very own ink, came words Harry had never written. \"Hello, Harry Potter. My name is Tom Riddle. How did you come by my diary?\" These words, too, faded away, but not before Harry had started to scribble back. \"Someone tried to flush it down a toilet.\" He waited eagerly for Riddle's reply. \"Lucky that I recorded my memories in some more lasting way than ink. But I always knew that there would be those who would not want this diary read. \" \"What do you mean?\" Harry scrawled, blotting the page in his excitement. *240* 206 `I mean that this diary holds memories of terrible things. Things that were covered up. Things that happened at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. \" \"That's where I am now,\" Harry wrote quickly. \"I'm at Hogwarts, and horrible stuff's been happening. Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?\" His heart was hammering. Riddle's reply came quickly, his writing becoming untidier, as though he was hurrying to tell all he knew. \"Of course I know about the Chamber of Secrets. In my day, they told us it was a legend, that it did not exist. But this was a lie. In my fifth year, the Chamber was opened and the monster attacked several students, finally killing one. I caught the person whod opened the Chamber and he was expelled. But the Headmaster, Professor Dippet, ashamed that such a thing had happened at Hogwarts, forbade me to tell the truth. A story was given out that thegirl had died in a freak accident. They gave me a nice, shiny, engraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut. But I knew it could happen again. The monster lived on, and the one who had the power to release it was not imprisoned. \" Harry nearly upset his ink bottle in his hurry to write back. \"It's happening again now. There have been three attacks and no one seems to know who's behind them. Who was it last time?\" \"I can show you, if you like, \"came Riddle's reply. \"You don't have to take my word for it. I can take you inside my memory of the night when I caught him. \" Harry hesitated, his quill suspended over the diary. What did Riddle mean? How could he be taken inside somebody else's memory? He glanced nervously at the door to the dormitory, which was *241* growing dark. When he looked back at the diary, he saw fresh words forming. 207 \"Let me show you. \" Harry paused for a fraction of a second and then wrote two letters. (40K.55 The pages of the diary began to blow as though caught in a high wind, stopping halfway through the month of June. Mouth hanging open, Harry saw that the little square for June thirteenth seemed to have turned into a miniscule television screen. His hands trembling slightly, he raised the book to press his eye against the little window, and before he knew what was happening, he was tilting forward; the window was widening, he felt his body leave his bed, and he was pitched headfirst through the opening in the page, into a whirl of color and shadow. He felt his feet hit solid ground, and stood, shaking, as the blurred shapes around him came suddenly into focus. He knew immediately where he was. This circular room with the sleeping portraits was Dumbledore's office - but it wasn't Dumbledore who was sitting behind the desk. A wizened, fraillooking wizard, bald except for a few wisps of white hair, was reading a letter by candlelight. Harry had never seen this man before. \"I'm sorry,\" he said shakily. \"I didn't mean to butt in -\" But the wizard didn't look up. He continued to read, frowning slightly. Harry drew nearer to his desk and stammered, \"Er - I'll just go, shall I?\" Still the wizard ignored him. He didn't seem even to have heard him. Thinking that the wizard might be deaf, Harry raised his voice. *242* \"Sorry I disturbed you. I'll go now,\" he half-shouted. The wizard folded up the letter with a sigh, stood up, walked past Harry without glancing at him, and went to draw the curtains at his window. 208 The sky outside the window was ruby-red; it seemed to be sunset. The wizard went back to the desk, sat down, and twiddled his thumbs, watching the door. Harry looked around the office. No Fawkes the phoenix - no whirring silver contraptions. This was Hogwarts as Riddle had known it, meaning that this unknown wizard was Headmaster, not Dumbledore, and he, Harry, was little more than a phantom, completely invisible to the people of fifty years ago. There was a knock on the office door. \"Enter,\" said the old wizard in a feeble voice. A boy of about sixteen entered, taking off his pointed hat. A silver prefect's badge was glinting on his chest. He was much taller than Harry, but he, too, had jet-black hair. \"Ah, Riddle,\" said the Headmaster. \"You wanted to see me, Professor Dippet?\" said Riddle. He looked nervous. \"Sit down,\" said Dippet. \"I've just been reading the letter you sent me. \"Oh,\" said Riddle. He sat down, gripping his hands together very tightly. \"My dear boy,\" said Dipper kindly, \"I cannot possibly let you stay at school over the summer. Surely you want to go home for the holidays?\" \"No,\" said Riddle at once. \"Id much rather stay at Hogwarts than go back to that - to that -\" * 243* \"You live in a Muggle orphanage during the holidays, I believe?\" said Dippet curiously. \"Yes, sir,\" said Riddle, reddening slightly. 209 \"You are Muggle-born?\" \"Half-blood, sir,\" said Riddle. \"Muggle father, witch mother.\" \"And are both your parents -?\" \"My mother died just after I was born, sir. They told me at the orphanage she lived just long enough to name me - Tom after my father, Marvolo after my grandfather.\" Dipper clucked his tongue sympathetically. \"The thing is, Tom,\" he sighed, \"Special arrangements might have been made for you, but in the current circumstances . . . .\" \"You mean all these attacks, sir?\" said Riddle, and Harry's heart leapt, and he moved closer, scared of missing anything. \"Precisely,\" said the headmaster. \"My dear boy, you must see how foolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle when term ends. Particularly in light of the recent tragedy ... the death of that poor little girl .... You will be safer by far at your orphanage. As a matter of fact, the Ministry of Magic is even now talking about closing the school. We are no nearer locating the er - source of all this unpleasantness . . . .\" Riddle's eyes had widened. \"Sir - if the person was caught - if it all stopped -\" \"What do you mean?\" said Dippet with a squeak in his voice, sitting up in his chair. \"Riddle, do you mean you know something about these attacks?\" \"No, sir,\" said Riddle quickly. But Harry was sure it was the same sort of \"no\" that he himself had given Dumbledore. *244* Dippet sank back, looking faintly disappointed. 210 \"You may go, Tom ...... Riddle slid off his chair and slouched out of the room. Harry followed him. Down the moving spiral staircase they went, emerging next to the gargoyle in the darkening corridor. Riddle stopped, and so did Harry, watching him. Harry could tell that Riddle was doing some serious thinking. He was biting his lip, his forehead furrowed. Then, as though he had suddenly reached a decision, he hurried off, Harry gliding noiselessly behind him. They didn't see another person until they reached the entrance hall, when a tall wizard with long, sweeping auburn hair and a beard called to Riddle from the marble staircase. \"What are you doing, wandering around this late, Tom?\" Harry gaped at the wizard. He was none other than a fifty-yearyounger Dumbledore. \"I had to see the headmaster, sir,\" said Riddle. \"Well, hurry off to bed,\" said Dumbledore, giving Riddle exactly the kind of penetrating stare Harry knew so well. \"Best not to roam the corridors these days. Not since . . .\" He sighed heavily, bade Riddle good night, and strode off. Riddle watched him walk out of sight and then, moving quickly, headed straight down the stone steps to the dungeons, with Harry in hot pursuit. But to Harry's disappointment, Riddle led him not into a hidden passageway or a secret tunnel but to the very dungeon in which Harry had Potions with Snape. The torches hadn't been lit, and when Riddle pushed the door almost closed, Harry could only just *2 45 * see him, standing stock-still by the door, watching the passage outside. 211 It felt to Harry that they were there for at least an hour. All he could see was the figure of Riddle at the door, staring through the crack, waiting like a statue. And just when Harry had stopped feeling expectant and tense and started wishing he could return to the present, he heard something move beyond the door. Someone was creeping along the passage. He heard whoever it was pass the dungeon where he and Riddle were hidden. Riddle, quiet as a shadow, edged through the door and followed, Harry tiptoeing behind him, forgetting that he couldn't be heard. For perhaps five minutes they followed the footsteps, until Riddle stopped suddenly, his head inclined in the direction of new noises. Harry heard a door creak open, and then someone speaking in a hoarse whisper. \"C'mon ... gotta get yeh outta here .... C'mon now ... in the box. . .\" There was something familiar about that voice .... Riddle suddenly jumped around the corner. Harry stepped out behind him. He could see the dark outline of a huge boy who was crouching in front of an open door, a very large box next to it. \"Evening, Rubeus,\" said Riddle sharply. The boy slammed the door shut and stood up. \"What yer doin' down here, Tom?\" Riddle stepped closer. \"It's all over,\" he said. \"I'm going to have to turn you in, Rubeus. They're talking about closing Hogwarts if the attacks don't stop.\" 4 6 \"N\" at d'yeh -\" \"I don't think you meant to kill anyone. But monsters don't make good pets. I suppose you just let it out for exercise and -\" 212 \"It never killed no one!\" said the large boy, backing against the closed door. From behind him, Harry could hear a funny rustling and clicking. \"Come on, Rubeus,\" said Riddle, moving yet closer. \"The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is make sure that the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered ...... \"It wasn't him!\" roared the boy, his voice echoing in the dark passage. \"He wouldn'! He never!\" \"Stand aside,\" said Riddle, drawing out his wand. His spell lit the corridor with a sudden flaming light. The door behind the large boy flew open with such force it knocked him into the wall opposite. And out of it came something that made Harry let out a long, piercing scream unheard by anyone A vast, low-slung, hairy body and a tangle of black legs; a gleam of many eyes and a pair of razor-sharp pincers - Riddle raised his wand again, but he was too late. The thing bowled him over as it scuttled away, tearing up the corridor and out of sight. Riddle scrambled to his feet, looking after it; he raised his wand, but the huge boy leapt on him, seized his wand, and threw him back down, yelling, \"NO000000!\" The scene whirled, the darkness became complete; Harry felt himself falling and, with a crash, he landed spread-eagled on his four-poster in the Gryffindor dormitory, Riddle's diary lying open on his stomach. *24 7* Before he had had time to regain his breath, the dormitory door opened and Ron came in. \"There you are,\" he said. Harry sat up. He was sweating and shaking. \"What's up?\" said Ron, looking at him with concern. \"It was Hagrid, Ron. Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty 213 years ago.\" Harry, Ron, and Hermione had always known that Hagrid had an unfortunate liking for large and monstrous creatures. During their first year at Hogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little wooden house, and it would be a long time before they forgot the giant, threeheaded dog he'd christened \"Fluffy.\" And if, as a boy, Hagrid had heard that a monster was hidden somewhere in the castle, Harry was sure he'd have gone to any lengths for a glimpse of it. He'd probably thought it was a shame that the monster had been cooped up so long, and thought it deserved the chance to stretch its many legs; Harry could just imagine the thirteen-year-old Hagrid trying to fit a leash and collar on it. But he was equally certain that Hagrid would never have meant to kill anybody. Harry half wished he hadn't found out how to work Riddle's diary. Again and again Ron and Hermione made him recount what he'd seen, until he was heartily sick of telling them and sick of the long, circular conversations that followed. \"Riddle might have got the wrong person,\" said Hermione. \"Maybe it was some other monster that was attacking people . . . .\" \"How many monsters d'you think this place can hold?\" Ron asked dully. \"We always knew Hagrid had been expelled,\" said Harry miserably. \"And the attacks must've stopped after Hagrid was kicked out. Otherwise, Riddle wouldn't have got his award.\" Ron tried a different tack. \"Riddle does sound like Percy - who asked him to squeal on Hagrid, anyway?\" \"But the monster had killed someone, Ron,\" said Hermione. \"And Riddle was going to go back to some Muggle orphanage if they closed Hogwarts,\" said Harry. \"I don't blame him for wanting to stay here ...... 214 \"You met Hagrid down Knockturn Alley, didn't you, Harry?\" \"He was buying a Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent,\" said Harry quickly. The three of them fell silent. After a long pause, Hermione voiced the knottiest question of all in a hesitant voice. \"Do you think we should go and ask Hagrid about it all?\" \"That'd be a cheerful visit,\" said Ron. \"'Hello, Hagrid. Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?\"' In the end, they decided that they would not say anything to Hagrid unless there was another attack, and as more and more days went by with no whisper from the disembodied voice, they became hopeful that they would never need to talk to him about why he had been expelled. It was now nearly four months since Justin and Nearly Headless Nick had been Petrified, and nearly everybody seemed to think that the attacker, whoever it was, had retired for good. Peeves had finally got bored of his \"Oh, Potter, you rotter\" song, Ernie Macmillan asked Harry quite politely to pass a bucket of leaping toadstools in Herbology one day, and in March several of the Mandrakes threw a loud and raucous party in greenhouse three. This made Professor Sprout very happy. \"The moment they start trying to move into each other's pots, we'll know they're fully mature,\" she told Harry. \"Then we'll be able to revive those poor people in the hospital wing.\" The second years were given something new to think about during their Easter holidays. The time had come to choose their subjects for the third year, a matter that Hermione, at least, took very seriously. \"it could affect our whole future,\" she told Harry and Ron as they pored over lists of new subjects, marking them with checks. \"I just want to give up Potions,\" said Harry. \"We can't,\" said Ron gloomily. \"We keep all our old subjects, or I'd've ditched Defense Against the Dark Arts.\" 215 \"But that's very important!\" said Hermione, shocked. \"Not the way Lockhart teaches it,\" said Ron. \"I haven't learned anything from him except not to set pixies loose.\" Neville Longbottom had been sent letters from all the witches and wizards in his family, all giving him different advice on what to choose. Confused and worried, he sat reading the subject lists with his tongue poking out, asking people whether they thought Arithmancy sounded more difficult than the study of Ancient Runes. Dean Thomas, who, like Harry, had grown up with Muggles, ended up closing his eyes and jabbing his wand at the list, then picking the subjects it landed on. Hermione took nobody's advice but signed up for everything. Harry smiled grimly to himself at the thought of what Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia would say if he tried to discuss his career in wizardry with them. Not that he didn't get any guidance: Percy Weasley was eager to share his experience. \"Depends where you want to go, Harry,\" he said. \"It's never too early to think about the future, so Id recommend Divination. People say Muggle Studies is a soft option, but I personally think wizards should have a thorough understanding of the non-magical community, particularly if they're thinking of working in close contact with them - look at my father, he has to deal with Muggle business all the time. My brother Charlie was always more of an outdoor type, so he went for Care of Magical Creatures. Play to your strengths, Harry.\" But the only thing Harry felt he was really good at was Quidditch. In the end, he chose the same new subjects as Ron, feeling that if he was lousy at them, at least he'd have someone friendly to help him. Gryffindor's next Quidditch match would be against Hufflepuff. Wood was insisting on team practices every night after dinner, so that Harry barely had time for anything but Quidditch and homework. However, the training sessions were getting better, or at least drier, and the evening before Saturday's match he went up to his dormitory to drop off his broomstick feeling Gryffindor's chances for the Quidditch cup had never been better. 216 But his cheerful mood didn't last long. At the top of the stairs to the dormitory, he met Neville Longbottom, who was looking frantic. \"Harry - I don't know who did it - I just found -\" Watching Harry fearfully, Neville pushed open the door. The contents of Harry's trunk had been thrown everywhere. His cloak lay ripped on the floor. The bedclothes had been pulled off his four-poster and the drawer had been pulled out of his bedside cabinet, the contents strewn over the mattress. Harry walked over to the bed, open-mouthed, treading on a few loose pages of Travels with Trolls. As he and Neville pulled the blankets back onto his bed, Ron, Dean, and Seamus came in. Dean swore loudly. \"What happened, Harry?\" \"No idea,\" said Harry. But Ron was examining Harry's robes. All the pockets were hanging out. \"Someone's been looking for something,\" said Ron. \"Is there anything missing?\" Harry started to pick up all his things and throw them into his trunk. It was only as he threw the last of the Lockhart books back into it that he realized what wasn't there. \"Riddle's diary's gone,\" he said in an undertone to Ron. \"What?\" Harry jerked his head toward the dormitory door and Ron followed him out. They hurried down to the Gryffindor common room, which was half-empty, and joined Hermione, who was sitting alone, reading a book called Ancient Runes Made Easy. Hermione looked aghast at the news. 217 \"But - only a Gryffindor could have stolen - nobody else knows our password -\" \"Exactly,\" said Harry. They woke the next day to brilliant sunshine and a light, refreshing breeze. \"Perfect Quidditch conditions!\" said Wood enthusiastically at the Gryffindor table, loading the team's plates with scrambled eggs. \"Harry, buck up there, you need a decent breakfast.\" Harry had been staring down the packed Gryffindor table, wondering if the new owner of Riddle's diary was right in front of his eyes. Hermione had been urging him to report the robbery, but Harry didn't like the idea. He'd have to tell a teacher all about the diary, and how many people knew why Hagrid had been expelled fifty years ago? He didn't want to be the one who brought it all up again. As he left the Great Hall with Ron and Hermione to go and collect his Quidditch things, another very serious worry was added to Harry's growing list. He had just set foot on the marble staircase when he heard it yet again \"Kill this time ... let me rip ... tear. . .\" He shouted aloud and Ron and Hermione both jumped away from him in alarm. \"The voice!\" said Harry, -looking over his shoulder. \"I just heard it again - didn't you?\" Ron shook his head, wide-eyed. Hermione, however, clapped a hand to her forehead. \"Harry - I think I've just understood something! I've got to go to the library!\" And she sprinted away, up the stairs. \"What does she understand?\" said Harry distractedly, still looking around, trying to tell where the voice had come from. 218 \"Loads more than I do,\" said Ron, shaking his head. \"But why's she got to go to the library?\" \"Because that's what Hermione does,\" said Ron, shrugging. \"When in doubt, go to the library.\" Harry stood, irresolute, trying to catch the voice again, but people were now emerging from the Great Hall behind him, talking loudly, exiting through the front doors on their way to the Quidditch pitch. \"You'd better get moving,\" said Ron. \"It's nearly eleven - the match - \" Harry raced up to Gryffindor Tower, collected his Nimbus Two Thousand, and joined the large crowd swarming across the grounds, but his mind was still in the castle along with the bodiless voice, and as he pulled on his scarlet robes in the locker. room, his only comfort was that everyone was now outside to watch the game. The teams walked onto the field to tumultuous applause. Oliver Wood took off for a warm-up flight around the goal posts; Madam Hooch released the balls. The Hufflepuffs, who played in canary yellow, were standing in a huddle, having a last-minute discussion of tactics. Harry was just mounting his broom when Professor McGonagall came half marching, half running across the pitch, carrying an enormous purple megaphone. Harry's heart dropped like a stone. \"This match has been cancelled,\" Professor McGonagall called through the megaphone, addressing the packed stadium. There were boos and shouts. Oliver Wood, looking devastated, landed and ran toward Professor McGonagall without getting off his broomstick. \"But, Professor!\" he shouted. \"We've got to play - the cup Gryffindor -\" 219 Professor McGonagall ignored him and continued to shout through her megaphone: \"All students are to make their way back to the House common rooms, where their Heads of Houses will give them further information. As quickly as you can, please!\" Then she lowered the megaphone and beckoned Harry over to her. \"Potter, I think you'd better come with me ...... Wondering how she could possibly suspect him this time, Harry saw Ron detach himself from the complaining crowd; he came running up to them as they set off toward the castle. To Harry's surprise, Professor McGonagall didn't object. \"Yes, perhaps you'd better come, too, Weasley ..... Some of the students swarming around them were grumbling about the match being canceled; others looked worried. Harry and Ron followed Professor McGonagall back into the school and up the marble staircase. But they weren't taken to anybody's office this time. \"This will be a bit of a shock,\" said Professor McGonagall in a surprisingly gentle voice as they approached the infirmary. \"There has been another attack ... another double attack.\" Harry's insides did a horrible somersault. Professor McGonagall pushed the door open and he and Ron entered. . Madam Pomfrey was bending over a fifth-year girl with long, curly hair. Harry recognized her as the Ravenclaw they'd accidentally asked for directions to the Slytherin common room. And on the bed next to her was \"Hermione!\" Ron groaned. Hermione lay utterly still, her eyes open and glassy. \"They were found near the library,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"I don't suppose either of you can explain this? It was on the floor next to them ...... 220 She was holding up a small, circular mirror. Harry and Ron shook their heads, both staring at Hermione. \"I will escort you back to Gryffindor Tower,\" said Professor McGonagall heavily. \"I need to address the students in any case. \"All students will return to their House common rooms by six o'clock in the evening. No student is to leave the dormitories after that time. You will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No student is to use the bathroom unaccompanied by a teacher. All further Quidditch training and matches are to be postponed. There will be no more evening activities.\" The Gryffindors packed inside the common room listened to Professor McGonagall in silence. She rolled up the parchment from which she had been reading and said in a somewhat choked voice, \"I need hardly add that I have rarely been so distressed. It is likely that the school will be closed unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught. I would urge anyone who thinks they might know anything about them to come forward.\" She climbed somewhat awkwardly out of the portrait hole, and the Gryffindors began talking immediately. \"That's two Gryffindors down, not counting a Gryffindor ghost, one Ravenclaw, and one Hufflepuff, \" said the Weasley twins' friend Lee Jordan, counting on his fingers. \"Haven't any of the teachers noticed that the Slytherins are all safe? Isn't it obvious all this stuff's coming from Slytherin? The Heir of Slytherin, the monster of Slytherin - why don't they just chuck all the Slytherins out?\" he roared, to nods and scattered applause. Percy Weasley was sitting in a chair behind Lee, but for once he didn't seem keen to make his views heard. He was looking pale and stunned. \"Percy's in shock,\" George told Harry quietly. \"That Ravenclaw girl - Penelope Clearwater - she's a prefect. I don't think he thought the monster would dare attack a prefect.\" 221 But Harry was only half-listening. He didn't seem to be able to get rid of the picture of Hermione, lying on the hospital bed as though carved out of stone. And if the culprit wasn't caught soon, he was looking at a lifetime back with the Dursleys. Tom Riddle had turned Hagrid in because he was faced with the prospect of a Muggle orphanage if the school closed. Harry now knew exactly how he had felt. \"What're we going to do?\" said Ron quietly in Harry's ear. \"D'you think they suspect Hagrid?\" \"We've got to go and talk to him,\" said Harry, making up his mind. \"I can't believe it's him this time, but if he set the monster loose last time he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets, and that's a start.\" \"But McGonagall said we've got to stay in our tower unless we're in class -\" \"I think,\" said Harry, more quietly still, \"it's time to get my dad's old cloak out again.\" Harry had inherited) ust one thing from his father: a long and sil very Invisibility Cloak. It was their only chance of sneaking out of the school to visit Hagrid without anyone knowing about it. They went to bed at the usual time, waited until Neville, Dean, and Sea mus had stopped discussing the Chamber of Secrets and finally fallen asleep, then got up, dressed again, and threw the cloak over themselves. The journey through the dark and deserted castle corridors wasn't enjoyable. Harry, who had wandered the castle at night sev eral times before, had never seen it so crowded after sunset. Teach ers, prefects, and ghosts were marching the corridors in pairs, staring around for any unusual activity. Their Invisibility Cloak didn't stop them making any noise, and there was a particularly tense moment when Ron stubbed his toe only yards from the spot where Snape stood standing guard. Thankfully, Snape sneezed at almost exactly the moment Ron swore. It was with relief that they reached the oak front doors and eased them open. It was a clear, starry night. They hurried toward the lit windows of Hagrid's house and pulled off the cloak only when they were right outside his front door. Seconds after they had knocked, Hagrid flung it open. They found themselves face-to-face with him aiming a crossbow at them. Fang 222 the boarhound barked loudly behind him. \"Oh,\" he said, lowering the weapon and staring at them. \"What're you two doin' here?\" \"What's that for?\" said Harry, pointing at the crossbow as they stepped inside. \"Nothin' - nothin' - \" Hagrid muttered. \"I've bin expectin' doesn' matter - Sit down - I'll make tea -\" He hardly seemed to know what he was doing. He nearly extinguished the fire, spilling water from the kettle on it, and then smashed the teapot with a nervous jerk of his massive hand. \"Are you okay, Hagrid?\" said Harry. \"Did you hear about Hermione?\" \"Oh, I heard, all righ',\" said Hagrid, a slight break in his voice. He kept glancing nervously at the windows. He poured them both large mugs of boiling water (he had forgotten to add tea bags) and was just putting a slab of fruitcake on a plate when there was a loud knock on the door. Hagrid dropped the fruitcake. Harry and Ron exchanged panicstricken looks, then threw the Invisibility Cloak back over themselves and retreated into a corner. Hagrid checked that they were hidden, seized his crossbow, and flung open his door once more. \"Good evening, Hagrid.\" It was Dumbledore. He entered, looking deadly serious, and was followed by a second, very odd-looking man. The stranger had rumpled gray hair and an anxious expression, and was wearing a strange mixture of clothes: a pinstriped suit, a scarlet tie, a long black cloak, and pointed purple boots. Under his arm he carried a lime-green bowler. 223 \"That's Dad's boss!\" Ron breathed. \"Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic!\" Harry elbowed Ron hard to make him shut up. Hagrid had gone pale and sweaty. He dropped into one of his chairs and looked from Dumbledore to Cornelius Fudge. \"Bad business, Hagrid,\" said Fudge in rather clipped tones. \"Very bad business. Had to come. Four attacks on Muggle-borns. Things've gone far enough. Ministry's got to act.\" \"I never,\" said Hagrid, looking imploringly at Dumbledore. \"You know I never, Professor Dumbledore, sir -\" \"I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence,\" said Dumbledore, frowning at Fudge. \"Look, Albus,\" said Fudge, uncomfortably. \"Hagrid's record's against him. Ministry's got to do something - the school governors have been in touch -\" \"Yet again, Cornelius, I tell you that taking Hagrid away will not help in the slightest,\" said Dumbledore. His blue eyes were full of a fire Harry had never seen before. \"Look at it from my point of view,\" said Fudge, fidgeting with his bowler. \"I'm under a lot of pressure. Got to be seen to be doing something. If it turns out it wasn't Hagrid, he'll be back and no more said. But I've got to take him. Got to. Wouldn't be doing my duty -\" \"Take me?\" said Hagrid, who was trembling. \"Take me where?\" \"For a short stretch only,\" said Fudge, not meeting Hagrid's eyes. \"Not a punishment, Hagrid, more a precaution. If someone else is caught, you'll be let out with a full apology -\" \"Not Azkaban?\" croaked Hagrid. Before Fudge could answer, there was another loud rap on the door. 224 Dumbledore answered it. It was Harry's turn for an elbow in the ribs; he'd let out an audible gasp. Mr. Lucius Malfoy strode into Hagrid's hut, swathed in a long black traveling cloak, smiling a cold and satisfied smile. Fang started to growl. \"Already here, Fudge,\" he said approvingly. \"Good, good. . .\" \"What're you doin' here?\" said Hagrid furiously. \"Get outta my house!\" \"My dear man, please believe me, I have no pleasure at all in being inside your - er - d'you call this a house?\" said Lucius Malfoy, sneering as he looked around the small cabin. \"I simply called at the school and was told that the headmaster was here.\" \"And what exactly did you want with me, Lucius?\" said Dumbledore. He spoke politely, but the fire was still blazing in his blue eyes. \"Dreadful thing, Dumbledore,\" said Malfoy lazily, taking out a long roll of parchment, \"but the governors feel it's time for you to step aside. This is an Order of Suspension - you'll find all twelve signatures on it. I'm afraid we feel you're losing your touch. How many attacks have there been now? Two more this afternoon, wasn't it? At this rate, there'll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts, and we all know what an awful loss that would be to the school.\" \"Oh, now, see here, Lucius,\" said Fudge, looking alarmed, \"Dumbledore suspended - no, no - last thing we want just now 262 \"The appointment - or suspension - of the headmaster is a matter for the governors, Fudge,\" said Mr. Malfoy smoothly. \"And as Dumbledore has failed to stop these attacks -\" \"See here, Malfoy, if Dumbledore can't stop them,\" said Fudge, whose upper lip was sweating now, \"I mean to say, who can?\" \"That remains to be seen,\" said Mr. Malfoy with a nasty smile. \"But as all twelve of us have voted -\" 225 Hagrid leapt to his feet, his shaggy black head grazing the ceiling. 'An' how many did yeh have ter threaten an' blackmail before they agreed, Malfoy, eh?\" he roared. \"Dear, dear, you know, that temper of yours will lead you into trouble one of these days, Hagrid,\" said Mr. Malfoy. \"I would advise you not to shout at the Azkaban guards like that. They won't like it at all.\" \"Yeh can' take Dumbledore!\" yelled Hagrid, making Fang the boarhound cower and whimper in his basket. \"Take him away, an' the Muggle-borns won' stand a chance! There'll be killin' next!\" \"Calm yourself, Hagrid,\" said Dumbledore sharply. He looked at Lucius Malfoy. \"If the governors want my removal, Lucius, I shall of course step aside -\" \"But -\" stuttered Fudge. \"No!\"growled Hagrid. Dumbledore had not taken his bright blue eyes off Lucius Malfoy's cold gray ones. \"However,\" said Dumbledore, speaking very slowly and clearly so that none of them could miss a word, \"you will find that I will * 26$* ummer was creeping over the grounds around the castle; sky and lake alike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst into bloom in the greenhouses. But with no Hagrid visible from the castle windows, striding the grounds with Fang at his heels, the scene didn't look right to Harry; no better, in fact, than the inside of the castle, where things were so horribly wrong. Harry and Ron had tried to visit Hermione, but visitors were now barred from the hospital wing. 226 \"We're taking no more chances,\" Madam Pomfrey told them severely through a crack in the infirmary door. \"No, I'm sorry, there's every chance the attacker might come back to finish these people off . . .\" With Dumbledore gone, fear had spread as never before, so that the sun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the mullioned windows. There was barely a face to be seen in the school * 265* that didn't look worried and tense, and any laughter that rang through the corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was quickly stifled. Harry constantly repeated Dumbledore's final words to himself \"I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me... Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.\" But what good were these words? Who exactly were they supposed to ask for help, when everyone was just as confused and scared as they were? Hagrid's hint about the spiders was far easier to understand the trouble was, there didn't seem to be a single spider left in the castle to follow. Harry looked everywhere he went, helped (rather reluctantly) by Ron. They were hampered, of course, by the fact that they weren't allowed to wander off on their own but had to move around the castle in a pack with the other Gryffindors. Most of their fellow students seemed glad that they were being shepherded from class to class by teachers, but Harry found it very irksome. One person, however, seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the atmosphere of terror and suspicion. Draco Malfoy was strutting around the school as though he had just been appointed Head Boy. Harry didn't realize what he was so pleased about until the Potions lesson about two weeks after Dumbledore and Hagrid had left, when, sitting right behind Malfoy, Harry overheard him gloating to Crabbe and Goyle. \"I always thought Father might be the one who got rid of Dumbledore,\" he said, not troubling to keep his voice down. \"I told you he thinks Dumbledore's the worst headmaster the school's ever 227 *266* had. Maybe we'll get a decent headmaster now. Someone who won't want the Chamber of Secrets closed. McGonagall won't last long, she's only filling in ...... Snape swept past Harry, making no comment about Hermione's empty seat and cauldron. \"Sir,\" said Malfoy loudly. \"Sir, why don't you apply for the headmaster's job?\" \"Now, now, Malfoy,\" said Snape, though he couldn't suppress a thinlipped smile. \"Professor Dumbledore has only been suspended by the governors. I daresay he'll be back with us soon enough.\" \"Yeah, right,\" said Malfoy, smirking. \"I expect you'd have Father's vote, sir, if you wanted to apply for the job - I'll tell Father you're the best teacher here, sir -\" Snape smirked as he swept off around the dungeon, fortunately not spotting Seamus Finnigan, who was pretending to vomit into his cauldron. \"I'm quite surprised the Mudbloods haven't all packed their bags by now,\" Malfoy went on. \"Bet you five Galleons the next one dies. Pity it wasn't Granger -\" The bell rang at that moment, which was lucky; at Malfoy's last words, Ron had leapt off his stool, and in the scramble to collect bags and books, his attempts to reach Malfoy went unnoticed. \"Let me at him,\" Ron growled as Harry and Dean hung onto his arms. \"I don't care, I don't need my wand, I'm going to kill him with my bare hands -\" \"Hurry up, I've got to take you all to Herbology,\" barked Snape over the class's heads, and off they marched, with Harry, Ron, and Dean bringing up the rear, Ron still trying to get loose. It was only * 261* 228 safe to let go of him when Snape had seen them out of the castle and they were making their way across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses. The Herbology class was very subdued; there were now two missing from their number, Justin and Hermione. Professor Sprout set them all to work pruning the Abyssinian Shrivelfigs. Harry went to tip an armful of withered stalks onto the compost heap and found himself face-to-face with Ernie Macmillan. Ernie took a deep breath and said, very formally, \"I just want to say, Harry, that I'm sorry I ever suspected you. I know you'd never attack Hermione Granger, and I apologize for all the stuff I said. We're all in the same boat now, and, well -\" He held out a pudgy hand, and Harry shook it. Ernie and his friend Hannah came to work at the same Shrivelfig as Harry and Ron. \"That Draco Malfoy character,\" said Ernie, breaking off dead twigs, \"he seems very pleased about all this, doesn't he? D'you know, I think he might be Slytherin's heir.\" \"That's clever of you,\" said Ron, who didn't seem to have forgiven Ernie as readily as Harry. \"Do you think it's Malfoy, Harry?\" Ernie asked. \"No,\" said Harry, so firmly that Ernie and Hannah stared. A second later, Harry spotted something. Several large spiders were scuttling over the ground on the other side of the glass, moving in an unnaturally straight line as though taking the shortest route to a prearranged meeting. Harry hit Ron over the hand with his pruning shears. \"Ouch! What're you -\" 268 229 Harry pointed out the spiders, following their progress with his eyes screwed up against the sun. \"Oh, yeah,\" said Ron, trying, and failing, to look pleased. \"But we can't follow them now -\" Ernie and Hannah were listening curiously. Harry's eyes narrowed as he focused on the spiders. If they pursued their fixed course, there could be no doubt about where they would end up. \"Looks like they're heading for the Forbidden Forest . . . .\" And Ron looked even unhappier about that. At the end of the lesson Professor Sprout escorted the class to their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson. Harry and Ron lagged behind the others so they could talk out of earshot. \"We'll have to use the Invisibility Cloak again,\" Harry told Ron. \"We can take Fang with us. He's used to going into the forest with Hagrid, he might be some help.\" \"Right,\" said Ron, who was twirling his wand nervously in his fingers. \"Er - aren't there - aren't there supposed to be werewolves in the forest?\" he added as they took their usual places at the back of Lockhart's classroom. Preferring not to answer that question, Harry said, \"There are good things in there, too. The centaurs are all right, and the unicorns ... Ron had never been into the Forbidden Forest before. Harry had entered it only once and had hoped never to do so again. Lockhart bounded into the room and the class stared at him. Every other teacher in the place was looking grimmer than usual, but Lockhart appeared nothing short of buoyant. 2 69 \"Come now,\" he cried, beaming around him. \"Why all these long 230 faces?\" People swapped exasperated looks, but nobody answered. \"Don't you people realize,\" said Lockhart, speaking slowly, as though they were all a bit dim, \"the danger has passed! The culprit has been taken away -\" \"Says who?\" said Dean Thomas loudly. \"My dear young man, the Minister of Magic wouldn't have taken Hagrid if he hadn't been one hundred percent sure that he was guilty,\" said Lockhart, in the tone of someone explaining that one and one made two. \"Oh, yes he would,\" said Ron, even more loudly than Dean. \"I flatter myself I know a touch more about Hagrid's arrest than you do, Mr. Weasley,\" said Lockhart in a self-satisfied tone. Ron started to say that he didn't think so, somehow, but stopped in midsentence when Harry kicked him hard under the desk. \"We weren't there, remember?\" Harry muttered. But Lockhart's disgusting cheeriness, his hints that he had always thought Hagrid was no good, his confidence that the whole business was now at an end, irritated Harry so much that he yearned to throw Gadding with Ghouls right in Lockhart's stupid face. Instead he contented himself with scrawling a note to Ron: Let's do it tonight. Ron read the message, swallowed hard, and looked sideways at the empty seat usually filled by Hermione. The sight seemed to stiffen his resolve, and he nodded. The Gryffindor common room was always very crowded these days, because from six o'clock onward the Gryffindors had no - *270* where else to go. They also had plenty to talk about, with the result that the common room often didn't empty until past midnight. 231 Harry went to get the Invisibility Cloak out of his trunk right after dinner, and spent the evening sitting on it, waiting for the room to clear. Fred and George challenged Harry and Ron to a few games of Exploding Snap, and Ginny sat watching them, very subdued in Hermione's usual chair. Harry and Ron kept losing on purpose, trying to finish the games quickly, but even so, it was well past midnight when Fred, George, and Ginny finally went to bed. Harry and Ron waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doors closing before seizing the cloak, throwing it over themselves, and climbing through the portrait hole. It was another difficult journey through the castle, dodging all the teachers. At last they reached the entrance hall, slid back the lock on the oak front doors, squeezed between them, trying to stop any creaking, and stepped out into the moonlit grounds. \"'Course,\" said Ron abruptly as they strode across the black grass, \"we might get to the forest and find there's nothing to follow. Those spiders might not've been going there at all. I know it looked like they were moving in that sort of general direction, but. . .\" His voice trailed away hopefully. They reached Hagrid's house, sad and sorry-looking with its blank windows. When Harry pushed the door open, Fang went mad with joy at the sight of them. Worried he might wake everyone at the castle with his deep, booming barks, they hastily fed him treacle fudge from a tin on the mantelpiece, which glued his teeth together. Harry left the Invisibility Cloak on Hagrid's table. There would be no need for it in the pitch-dark forest. * 21:L * \"C'mon, Fang, we're going for a walk,\" said Harry, patting his leg, and Fang bounded happily out of the house behind them, dashed to the edge of the forest, and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree. Harry took out his wand, murmured, \"Lumos!\" and a tiny light appeared at the end of it, just enough to let them watch the path for 232 signs of spiders. \"Good thinking,\" said Ron. \"Id light mine, too, but you know - it'd probably blow up or something ...... Harry tapped Ron on the shoulder, pointing at the grass. Two solitary spiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of the trees. \"Okay,\" Ron sighed as though resigned to the worst, \"I'm ready. Let's go.\" So, with Fang scampering around them, sniffing tree roots and leaves, they entered the forest. By the glow of Harry's wand, they followed the steady trickle of spiders moving along the path. They walked behind them for about twenty minutes, not speaking, listening hard for noises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves. Then, when the trees had become thicker than ever, so that the stars overhead were no longer visible, and Harry's wand shone alone in the sea of dark, they saw their spider guides leaving the path. Harry paused, trying to see where the spiders were going, but everything outside his little sphere of *light was pitch-black. He had never been this deep into the forest before. He could vividly remember Hagrid advising him not to leave the forest path last time he'd been in here. But Hagrid was miles away now, probably sitting in a cell in Azkaban, and he had also said to follow the spiders. * 2-V2 * Something wet touched Harry's hand and he jumped backward, crushing Rods foot, but it was only Fang's nose. \"What d'you reckon?\" Harry said to Ron, whose eyes he could just make out, reflecting the light from his wand. \"We've come this far,\" said Ron. So they followed the darting shadows of the spiders into the trees. They couldn't move very quickly now; there were tree roots and stumps in their way, barely visible in the near blackness. Harry could feel Fang's hot breath on his hand. More than once, they had to stop, 233 so that Harry could crouch down and find the spiders in the wandlight. They walked for what seemed like at least half an hour, their robes snagging on low-slung branches and brambles. After a while, they noticed that the ground seemed to be sloping downward, though the trees were as thick as ever. Then Fang suddenly let loose a great, echoing bark, making both Harry and Ron jump out of their skins. \"What?\" said Ron loudly, looking around into the pitch-dark, and gripping Harry's elbow very hard. \"There's something moving over there,\" Harry breathed. \"Listen ... sounds like something big ...... They listened. Some distance to their right, the something big was snapping branches as it carved a path through the trees. \"Oh, no,\" said Ron. \"Oh, no, oh, no, oh -\" \"Shut up,\" said Harry frantically. \"It'll hear you.\" \"Hear me?\" said Ron in an unnaturally high voice. \"It's already heard Fang!\" The darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as they * 273* stood, terrified, waiting. There was a strange rumbling noise and then silence. \"What d'you think it's doing?\" said Harry. \"Probably getting ready to pounce,\" said Ron. They waited, shivering, hardly daring to move. \"D'you think it's gone?\" Harry whispered. \"Dunno -\" 234 Then, to their right, came a sudden blaze of light, so bright in the darkness that both of them flung up their hands to shield their eyes. Fang yelped and tried to run, but got lodged in a tangle of thorns and yelped even louder. \"Harry!\" Ron shouted, his voice breaking with relief \"Harry, it's our car!\" \"What?\" \"Come on!\" Harry blundered after Ron toward the light, stumbling and tripping, and a moment later they had emerged into a clearing. Mr. Weasley's car was standing, empty, in the middle of a circle of thick trees under a roof of dense branches, its headlights ablaze. As Ron walked, open-mouthed, toward it, it moved slowly toward him, exactly like a large, turquoise dog greeting its owner. \"It's been here all the time!\" said Ron delightedly, walking around the car. \"Look at it. The forest's turned it wild . . . .\" The sides of the car were scratched and smeared with mud. Apparently it had taken to trundling around the forest on its own. Fang didn't seem at all keen on it; he kept close to Harry, who could feel him quivering. His breathing slowing down again, Harry stuffed his wand back into his robes. *214* \"And we thought it was going to attack us!\" said Ron, leaning against the car and patting it. \"I wondered where it had gone!\" Harry squinted around on the floodlit ground for signs of more spiders, but they had all scuttled away from the glare of the headlights. \"We've lost the trail,\" he said. \"C'mon, let's go and find them.\" Ron didn't speak. He didn't move. His eyes were fixed on a point some ten feet above the forest floor, right behind Harry. His face was 235 livid with terror. Harry didn't even have time to turn around. There was a loud clicking noise and suddenly he felt something long and hairy seize him around the middle and lift him off the ground, so that he was hanging facedown. Struggling, terrified, he heard more clicking, and saw Ron's legs leave the ground, too, heard Fang whimpering and howling - next moment, he was being swept away into the dark trees. Head hanging, Harry saw that what had hold of him was marching on six immensely long, hairy legs, the front two clutching him tightly below a pair of shining black pincers. Behind him, he could hear another of the creatures, no doubt carrying Ron. They were moving into the very heart of the forest. Harry could hear Fang fighting to free himself from a third monster, whining loudly, but Harry couldn't have yelled even if he had wanted to; he seemed to have left his voice back with the car in the clearing. He never knew how long he was in the creature's clutches; he only knew that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for him to see that the leaf-strewn ground was now swarming with spiders. Craning his neck sideways, he realized that they had reached the ridge of *21$* a vast hollow, a hollow that had been cleared of trees, so that the stars shone brightly onto the worst scene he had ever laid eyes on. Spiders. Not tiny spiders like those surging over the leaves below. Spiders the size of carthorses, eight-eyed, eight-legged, black, hairy, gigantic. The massive specimen that was carrying Harry made its way down the steep slope toward a misty, domed web in the very center of the hollow, while its fellows closed in all around it, clicking their pincers excitedly at the sight of its load. Harry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him. Ron and Fang thudded down next to him. Fang wasn't howling anymore, but cowering silently on the spot. Ron looked exactly like Harry felt. His mouth was stretched wide in a kind of silent scream and his eyes were popping. Harry suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped him was 236 saying something. It had been hard to tell, because he clicked his pincers with every word he spoke. \"Aragog!\" it called. \"Aragog!\" And from the middle of the misty, domed web, a spider the size of a small elephant emerged, very slowly. There was gray in the black of his body and legs, and each of the eyes on his ugly, pincered head was milky white. He was blind. \"What is it?\" he said, clicking his pincers rapidly. \"Men,\" clicked the spider who had caught Harry. \"Is it Hagrid?\" said Aragog, moving closer, his eight milky eyes wandering vaguely. \"Strangers,\" clicked the spider who had brought Ron. \"Kill them,\" clicked Aragog fretfully. \"I was sleeping ...... \"We're friends of Hagrid's,\" Harry shouted. His heart seemed to have left his chest to pound in his throat. *216* Click, click, click went the pincers of the spiders all around the hollow. Aragog paused. \"Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before,\" he said slowly. \"Hagrid's in trouble,\" said Harry, breathing very fast. \"That's why we've come.\" \"In trouble?\" said the aged spider, and Harry thought he heard concern beneath the clicking pincers. \"But why has he sent you?\" Harry thought of getting to his feet but decided against it; he didn't think his legs would support him. So he spoke from the ground, as calmly as he could. 237 \"They think,, up at the school, that Hagrid's been setting a a - something on students. They've taken him to Azkaban.\" Aragog clicked his pincers furiously, and all around the hollow the sound was echoed by the crowd of spiders; it was like applause, except applause didn't usually make Harry feel sick with fear. \"But that was years ago,\" said Aragog fretfully. \"Years and years ago. I remember it well. That's why they made him leave the school. They believed that I was the monster that dwells in what they call the Chamber of Secrets. They thought that Hagrid had opened the Chamber and set me free.\" \"And you ... you didn't come from the Chamber of Secrets?\" said Harry, who could feel cold sweat on his forehead. \"I!\" said Aragog, clicking angrily. \"I was not born in the castle. I come from a distant land. A traveler gave me to Hagrid when I was an egg. Hagrid was only a boy, but he cared for me, hidden in a cupboard in the castle, feeding me on scraps from the table. Hagrid 2Y is my good friend, and a good man. When I was discovered, and blamed for the death of a girl, he protected me. I have lived here in the forest ever since, where Hagrid still visits me. He even found me a wife, Mosag, and you see how our family has grown, all through Hagrid's goodness ...... Harry summoned what remained of his courage. \"So you never - never attacked anyone?\" \"Never,\" croaked the old spider. \"It would have been my instinct, but out of respect for Hagrid, I never harmed a human. The body of the girl who was killed was discovered in a bathroom. I never saw any part of the castle but the cupboard in which I grew up. Our kind like the dark and the quiet ...... \"But then ... Do you know what did kill that girl?\" said Harry. \"Because whatever it is, it's back and attacking people again -\" 238 His words were drowned by a loud outbreak of clicking and the rustling of many long legs shifting angrily; large black shapes shifted all around him. \"The thing that lives in the castle,\" said Aragog, \"is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others. Well do I remember how I pleaded with Hagrid to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about the school.\" \"What is it?\" said Harry urgently. More loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in. \"We do not speak of it!\" said Aragog fiercely. \"We do not name it! I never even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature, though he asked me, many times.\" Harry didn't want to press the subject, not with the spiders * 2-V8 * pressing closer on all sides. Aragog seemed to be tired of tamng. He was backing slowly into his domed web, but his fellow spiders continued to inch slowly toward Harry and Ron. \"We'll just go, then,\" Harry called desperately to Aragog, hearing leaves rustling behind him. \"Go?\" said Aragog slowly. \"I think not ...... \"But - but -\" \"My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command. But I cannot deny them fresh meat, when it wanders so willingly into our midst. Good-bye, friend of Hagrid.\" Harry spun around. Feet away, towering above him, was a solid wall of spiders, clicking, their many eyes gleaming in their ugly black heads. Even as he reached for his wand, Harry knew it was no good, there were too many of them, but as he tried to stand, ready to die fighting, a loud, long note sounded, and a blaze of light flamed through the 239 hollow. Mr. Weasley's car was thundering down the slope, headlights glaring, its horn screeching, knocking spiders aside; several were thrown onto their backs, their endless legs waving in the air. The car screeched to a halt in front of Harry and Ron and the doors flew open. \"Get Fang!\" Harry yelled, diving into the front seat; Ron seized the boarhound around the middle and threw him, yelping, into the back of the car - the doors slammed shut - Ron didn't touch the accelerator but the car didn't need him; the engine roared and they were off, hitting more spiders. They sped up the slope, out of the hollow, and they were soon crashing through the forest, branches whipping the windows as the car wound its way cleverly through the widest gaps, following a path it obviously knew. Harry looked sideways at Ron. His mouth was still open in the silent scream, but his eyes weren't popping anymore. \"Are you okay?\" Ron stared straight ahead, unable to speak. They smashed their way through the undergrowth, Fang howling loudly in the back seat, and Harry saw the side mirror snap off as they squeezed past a large oak. After ten noisy, rocky minutes, the trees thinned, and Harry could again see patches of sky. The car stopped so suddenly that they were nearly thrown into the windshield. They had reached the edge of the forest. Fang flung himself at the window in his anxiety to get out, and when Harry opened the door, he shot off through the trees to Hagrid's house, tail between his legs. Harry got out too, and after a minute or so, Ron seemed to regain the feeling in his limbs and followed, still stiff-necked and staring. Harry gave the car a grateful pat as it reversed back into the forest and disappeared from view. Harry went back into Hagrid's cabin to get the Invisibility Cloak. Fang was trembling under a blanket in his basket. When Harry got outside again, he found Ron being violently sick in the pumpkin patch. 240 \"Follow the spiders,\" said Ron weakly, wiping his mouth on his sleeve. \"I'll never forgive Hagrid. We're lucky to be alive.\" \"I bet he thought Aragog wouldn't hurt friends of his,\" said Harry. \"That's exactly Hagrid's problem!\" said Ron, thumping the wall of the cabin. \"He always thinks monsters aren't as bad as they're *280* made out, and look where it's got him! A cell in Azkaban!\" He was shivering uncontrollably now. \"What was the point of sending us in there? What have we found out, Id like to know?\" \"That Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets,\" said Harry, throwing the cloak over Ron and prodding him in the arm to make him walk. \"He was innocent.\" Ron gave a loud snort. Evidently, hatching Aragog in a cupboard wasn't his idea of being innocent. As the castle loomed nearer Harry twitched the cloak to make sure their feet were hidden, then pushed the creaking front doors ajar. They walked carefully back across the entrance hall and up the marble staircase, holding their breath as they passed corridors where watchful sentries were walking. At last they reached the safety of the Gryffindor common room, where the fire had burned itself into glowing ash. They took off the cloak and climbed the winding stair to their dormitory. Ron fell onto his bed without bothering to get undressed. Harry, however, didn't feel very sleepy. He sat on the edge of his fourposter, thinking hard about everything Aragog had said. The creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle, he thought, sounded like a sort of monster Voldemort - even other monsters didn't want to name it. But he and Ron were no closer to finding out what it was, or how it Petrified its victims. Even Hagrid had never known what was in the Chamber of Secrets. Harry swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned back against his pillows, watching the moon glinting at him through the tower window. 241 He couldn't see what else they could do. They had hit dead ends *281* everywhere. Riddle had caught the wrong person, the Heir of Slytherin had got off, and no one could tell whether it was the same person, or a different one, who had opened the Chamber this time. There was nobody else to ask. Harry lay down, still thinking about what Aragog had said. He was becoming drowsy when what seemed like their very last hope occurred to him, and he suddenly sat bolt upright. \"Ron,\" he hissed through the dark, \"Ron -\" Ron woke with a yelp like Fang's, stared wildly around, and saw Harry. \"Ron -that girl who died. Aragog said she was found in a bathroom,\" said Harry, ignoring Neville's snufing snores from the corner. \"What if she never left the bathroom? What if she's still there?\" Ron rubbed his eyes, frowning through the moonlight. And then he understood, too. \"You don't think - not Moaning Myrtle?\" A ll those times we were in that bathroom, and she was just three toilets away,\" said Ron bitterly at breakfast next day, \"and we could've asked her, and now. . .\" It had been hard enough trying to look for spiders. Escaping their teachers long enough to sneak into a girls' bathroom, the girls' bathroom, moreover, right next to the scene of the first attack, was going to be almost impossible. But something happened in their first lesson, Transfiguration, that drove the Chamber of Secrets out of their minds for the first time in weeks. Ten minutes into the class, Professor McGonagall told them that their exams would start on the first of June, one week from today. 242 `Exams?\" howled Seamus Finnigan. \"We're still getting exams?\" There was a loud bang behind Harry as Neville Longbottom's wand slipped, vanishing one of the legs on his desk. Professorr *28%* McGonagall restored it with a wave of her own wand, and turned, frowning, to Seamus. \"The whole point of keeping the school open at this time is for you to receive your education,\" she said sternly. \"The exams will therefore take place as usual, and I trust you are all studying hard.\" Studying hard! It had never occurred to Harry that there would be exams with the castle in this state. There was a great deal of mutinous muttering around the room, which made Professor McGonagall scowl even more darkly. \"Professor Dumbledore's instructions were to keep the school running as normally as possible, she said. \"And that, I need hardly point out, means finding out how much you have learned this year. Harry looked down at the pair of white rabbits he was supposed to be turning into slippers. What had he learned so far this year? He couldn't seem to think of anything that would be useful in an exam. Ron looked as though he'd just been told he had to go and live in the Forbidden Forest. \"Can you imagine me taking exams with this?\" he asked Harry, holding up his wand, which had just started whistling loudly. Three days before their first exam, Professor McGonagall made another announcement at breakfast. \"I have good news,\" she said, and the Great Hall, instead of falling silent, erupted. 243 \"Dumbledore's coming back!\" several people yelled joyfully. \"You've caught the Heir of Slytherin!\" squealed a girl at the Ravenclaw table. 284* \"Quidditch matches are back on!\" roared Wood excitedly. When the hubbub had subsided, Professor McGonagall said, \"Professor Sprout has informed me that the Mandrakes are ready for cutting at last. Tonight, we will be able to revive those people who have been Petrified. I need hardly remind you all that one of them may well be able to tell us who, or what, attacked them. I am hopeful that this dreadful year will end with our catching the culprit.\" There was an explosion of cheering. Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and wasn't at all surprised to see that Draco Malfoy hadn't joined in. Ron, however, was looking happier than he'd looked in days. \"It won't matter that we never asked Myrtle, then!\" he said to Harry. \"Hermione'll probably have all the answers when they wake her up! Mind you, she'll go crazy when she finds out we've got exams in three days' time. She hasn't studied. It might be kinder to leave her where she is till they're over.\" Just then, Ginny Weasley came over and sat down next to Ron. She looked tense and nervous, and Harry noticed that her hands were twisting in her lap. \"What's up?\" said Ron, helping himself to more porridge. Ginny didn't say anything, but glanced up and down the Gryffindor table with a scared look on her face that reminded Harry of someone, though he couldn't think who. \"Spit it out,\" said Ron, watching her. Harry suddenly realized who Ginny looked like. She was rocking backward and forward slightly in her chair, exactly like Dobby did when he was teetering on the edge of revealing forbidden information. 244 \"I've got to tell you something,\" Ginny mumbled, carefully not looking at Harry. \"What is it?\" said Harry. Ginny looked as though she couldn't find the right words. \"What?\"said Ron. Ginny opened her mouth, but no sound came out. Harry leaned forward and spoke quietly, so that only Ginny and Ron could hear him. \"Is it something about the Chamber of Secrets? Have you seen something? Someone acting oddly?\" Ginny drew a deep breath and, at that precise moment, Percy Weasley appeared, looking tired and wan. \"If you've finished eating, I'll take that seat, Ginny. I'm starving, I've only just come off patrol duty.\" Ginny jumped up as though her chair had just been electrified, gave Percy a fleeting, frightened look, and scampered away. Percy sat down and grabbed a mug from the center of the table. \"Percy!\" said Ron angrily. \"She was just about to tell us some-' thing important!\" Halfway through a gulp of tea, Percy choked. \"What sort of thing?\" he said, coughing. \"I just asked her if she'd seen anything odd, and she started to say \"Oh - that - that's nothing to do with the Chamber of Secrets,\" said Percy at once. \"How do you know?\" said Ron, his eyebrows raised. \"Well, er, if you must know, Ginny, er, walked in on me the other day when I was - well, never mind - the point is, she spot 245 ted me doing something and I, um, I asked her not to mention it to anybody. I must say, I did think she'd keep her word. It's nothing, really, Id just rather -\" Harry had never seen Percy look so uncomfortable. \"What were you doing, Percy?\" said Ron, grinning. \"Go on, tell us, we won't laugh.\" Percy didn't smile back. \"Pass me those rolls, Harry, I'm starving.\" Harry knew the whole mystery might be solved tomorrow without their help, but he wasn't about to pass up a chance to speak to Myrtle if it turned up - and to his delight it did, midmorning, when they were being led to History of Magic by Gilderoy Lockhart. Lockhart, who had so often assured them that all danger had passed, only to be proved wrong right away, was now wholeheartedly convinced that it was hardly worth the trouble to see them safely down the corridors. His hair wasn't as sleek as usual; it seemed he had been up most of the night, patrolling the fourth floor. \"Mark my words,\" he said, ushering them around a corner. \"The first words out of those poor Petrified people's mouths will be It was Hagrid.' Frankly, I'm astounded Professor McGonagall thinks all these security measures are necessary.\" (ti agree, sir,\" said Harry, making Ron drop his books in surprise. \"Thank you, Harry, said Lockhart graciously while they waited for a long line of Hufflepuffs to pass. \"I mean, we teachers have quite enough to be getting on with, without walking students to classes and standing guard all night ...... \"That's right,\" said Ron, catching on. \"Why don't you leave us here, sir, we've only got one more corridor to go -\" \"You know, Weasley, I think I will,\" said Lockhart. \"I really should go and prepare my next class -\" 246 And he hurried off. \"Prepare his class,\" Ron sneered after him. \"Gone to curl his hair, more like.\" They let the rest of the Gryffindors draw ahead of them, then darted down a side passage and hurried off toward Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. But just as they were congratulating each other on their brilliant scheme \"Potter! Weasley! What are you doing?\" It was Professor McGonagall, and her mouth was the thinnest of thin lines. \"We were -we were-\" Ron stammered. \"We were going to - to go and see -\" \"Hermione,\" said Harry. Ron and Professor McGonagall both looked at him. \"We haven't seen her for ages, Professor,\" Harry went on hurriedly, treading on Ron's foot, \"and we thought we'd sneak into the hospital wing, you know, and tell her the Mandrakes are nearly ready and, er, not to worry -\" Professor McGonagall was still staring at him, and for a moment, Harry thought she was going to explode, but when she spoke, it was in a strangely croaky voice. \"Of course,\" she said, and Harry, amazed, saw a tear glistening in her beady eye. \"Of course, I realize this has all been hardest on the friends of those who have been ... I quite understand. Yes, Potter, of course you may visit Miss Granger. I will inform Professor Binns where you've gone. Tell Madam Pomfrey I have given my permission.\" Harry and Ron walked away, hardly daring to believe that they'd avoided detention. As they turned the corner, they distinctly heard Professor McGonagall blow her nose. 247 \"That,\" said Ron fervently, \"was the best story you've ever come up with.\" They had no choice now but to go to the hospital wing and tell Madam Pomfrey that they had Professor McGonagall's permission to visit Hermione. Madam Pomfrey let them in, but reluctantly. \"There's just no point talking to a Petrified. person,\" she said, and they had to admit she had a point when they'd taken their seats next to Hermione. It was plain that Hermione didn't have the faintest inkling that she had visitors, and that they might just as well tell her bedside cabinet not to worry for all the good it would do. \"Wonder if she did see the attacker, though?\" said Ron, looking sadly at Hermione's rigid face. \"Because if he sneaked up on them all, no one'll ever know . ..... But Harry wasn't looking at Hermione's face. He was more interested in her right hand. It lay clenched on top of her blankets, and bending closer, he saw that a piece of paper was scrunched inside her fist. Making sure that Madam Pomfrey was nowhere near, he pointed this out to Ron. \"TG and get it out,\" Ron whispered, shifting his chair so that he blocked Harry from Madam Pomfrey's view. It was no easy task. Hermione's hand was clamped so tightly around the paper that Harry was sure he was going to tear it. While Ron kept watch he tugged and twisted, and at last, after several tense minutes, the paper came free. It was a page torn from a very old library book. Harry smoothed it out eagerly and Ron leaned close to read it, too. Of the many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam our land, there is none more curious or more deadly than the Basilisk, known also as the King of Serpents. This snake, which may reach gigantic size and live many hundreds of years, is born 248 from a chicken's egg, hatched beneath a toad. Its methods of killing are most wondrous, for aside from its deadly and venomous fangs, the Basilisk has a murderous stare, and all who are fixed with the beam of its eye shall suffer instant death. Spiders flee before the Basilisk, for it is their mortal enemy, and the Basilisk flees only from the crowing of the rooster, which is fatal to it. And beneath this, a single word had been written, in a hand Harry recognized as Hermione's. Pipes. It was as though somebody had just flicked a light on in his brain. \"Ron,\" he breathed. \"This is it. This is the answer. The monster in the Chamber's a basilisk - a giant serpent! That why I've been hearing that voice all over the place, and nobody else has heard it. It's because I understand Parseltongue . . . .\" Harry looked up at the beds around him. \"The basilisk kills people by looking at them. But no one's died - because no one looked it straight in the eye. Colin saw it through his camera. The basilisk burned up all the film inside it, but Colin just got Petrified. Justin . . . Justin must've seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick! Nick got the full blast of it, but he couldn't die again . . . and Hermione and that Ravenclaw prefect were found with a mirror next to them. Hermione had just realized the monster was a basilisk. I bet you anything she warned the first person she met to look around corners with a mirror first! And that girl pulled out her mirror - and -\" Rods jaw had dropped. \"And Mrs. Norris?\" he whispered eagerly. Harry thought hard, picturing the scene on the night of Halloween. \"The water. . .\" he said slowly. \"The flood from Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. I bet you Mrs. Norris only saw the reflection . . . .\" He scanned the page in his hand eagerly. The more he looked at it, the more it made sense. 249 `: . . The crowing of the rooster . . . is fatal to it\"! he read aloud. \"Hagrid's roosters were killed! The Heir of Slytherin didn't want one anywhere near the castle once the Chamber was opened! Spidersflee before it.! It all fits!\" \"But how's the basilisk been getting around the place?\" said Ron. \"A giant snake . . . Someone would've seen. . .\" Harry, however, pointed at the word Hermione had scribbled at the foot of the page. \"Pipes,\" he said. \"Pipes . . . Ron, it's been using the plumbing. I've been hearing that voice inside the walls . . . .\" 291* Ron suddenly grabbed Harry's arm. \"The entrance to the Chamber of Secrets!\" he said hoarsely. \"What if it's a bathroom? What if it's in -\" `= Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, \"said Harry. They sat there, excitement coursing through them, hardly able to believe it. \"This means,\" said Harry, \"I can't be the only Parselmouth in the school. The Heir of Slytherin's one, too. That's how he's been controlling the basilisk.\" \"What're we going to do?\" said Ron, whose eyes were flashing. \"Should we go straight to McGonagall?\" \"Let's go to the staff room,\" said Harry, jumping up. \"She'll be there in ten minutes. It's nearly break.\" They ran downstairs. Not wanting to be discovered hanging around in another corridor, they went straight into the deserted staff room. It was a large, paneled room full of dark, wooden chairs. Harry and Ron paced around it, too excited to sit down. But the bell to signal break never came. Instead, echoing through the corridors came Professor McGon agall's voice, magically magnified. `All students to return to their House dormitories at once. All teach ers return to the staff room. Immediately, please. \" Harry wheeled around to stare at Ron. \"Not another attack? Not now?\" 250 \"What'll we do?\" said Ron, aghast. \"Go back to the dormitory?\" \"No,\" said Harry, glancing around. There was an ugly sort of wardrobe to his left, full of the teachers' cloaks. \"In here. Let's hear what it's all about. Then we can tell them what we've found out.\" They hid themselves inside it, listening to the rumbling of hundreds of people moving overhead, and the staff room door banging open. From between the musty folds of the cloaks, they watched the teachers filtering into the room. Some of them were looking puzzled, others downright scared. Then Professor McGonagall arrived. \"It has happened,\" she told the silent staff room. \"A student has been taken by the monster. Right into the Chamber itself.\" Professor Flitwick let out a squeal. Professor Sprout clapped her hands over her mouth. Snape gripped the back of a chair very hard and said, \"How can you be sure?\" \"The Heir of Slytherin,\" said Professor McGonagall, who was very white, \"left another message. Right underneath the first one. `Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever. \"' Professor Flitwick burst into tears. \"Who is it?\" said Madam Hooch, who had sunk, weak-kneed, into a chair. \"Which student?\" \"Ginny Weasley,\" said Professor McGonagall. Harry felt Ron slide silently down onto the wardrobe floor beside him. \"We shall have to send all the students home tomorrow,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"This is the end of Hogwarts. Dumbledore always said. . .\" The staffroom door banged open again. For one wild moment, Harry was sure it would be Dumbledore. But it was Lockhart, and he was beaming. \"So sorry - dozed off - what have I missed?\" 251 He didn't seem to notice that the other teachers were looking at him with something remarkably like hatred. Snape stepped forward. \"Just the man,\" he said. \"The very man. A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Taken into the Chamber of Secrets itself. Your moment has come at last.\" Lockhart blanched. \"That's right, Gilderoy,\" chipped in Professor Sprout. \"Weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?\" \"I - well, I -\"sputtered Lockhart. \"Yes, didn't you tell me you were sure you knew what was inside it?\" piped up Professor Flitwick. \"D-did I? I don't recall -\" \"I certainly remember you saying you were sorry you hadn't had a crack at the monster before Hagrid was arrested,\" said Snape. \"Didn't you say that the whole affair had been bungled, and that you should have been given a free rein from the first?\" Lockhart stared around at his stony-faced colleagues. \"I - I really never - you may have misunderstood -\" \"We'll leave it to you, then, Gilderoy,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Tonight will be an excellent time to do it. We'll make sure everyone's out of your way. You'll be able to tackle the monster all by youself. A free rein at last.\" Lockhart gazed desperately around him, but nobody came to the rescue. He didn't look remotely handsome anymore. His lip was trembling, and in the absence of his usually toothy grin, he looked weak-chinned and feeble. \"V very well,\" he said. \"I'll - I'll be in my office, getting getting ready.\" And he left the room. 252 \"Right,\" said Professor McGonagall, whose nostrils were flared, \"that's got him out from under our feet. The Heads of Houses should go and inform their students what has happened. Tell them the Hogwarts Express will take them home first thing tomorrow. Will the rest of you please make sure no students have been left outside their dormitories.\" The teachers rose and left, one by one. It was probably the worst day of Harry's entire life. He, Ron, Fred, and George sat together in a corner of the Gryffindor common room, unable to say anything to each other. Percy wasn't there. He had gone to send an owl to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, then shut himself up in his dormitory. No afternoon ever lasted as long as that one, nor had Gryffindor Tower ever been so crowded, yet so quiet. Near sunset, Fred and George went up to bed, unable to sit there any longer. \"She knew something, Harry,\" said Ron, speaking for the first time since they had entered the wardrobe in the staff room. \"That's why she was taken. It wasn't some stupid thing about Percy at all., She'd found out something about the Chamber of Secrets. That must be why she was -\" Ron rubbed his eyes frantically. \"I mean, she was a pureblood. There can't be any other reason.\" Harry could see the sun sinking, blood-red, below the skyline. This was the worst he had ever felt. If only there was something they could do. Anything. \"Harry\" said Ron. \"D'you think there's any chance at all she's not - you know =\" Harry didn't know what to say. He couldn't see how Ginny could still be alive. \"D'you know what?\" said Ron. \"I think we should go and see *295* 253 Lockhart. Tell him what we know. He's going to try and get into the Chamber. We can tell him where we think it is, and tell him it's a basilisk in there.\" Because Harry couldn't think of anything else to do, and because he wanted to be doing something, he agreed. The Gryffindors around them were so miserable, and felt so sorry for the Weasleys, that nobody tried to stop them as they got up, crossed the room, and left through the portrait hole. Darkness was falling as they walked down to Lockhart's office. There seemed to be a lot of activity going on inside it. They could hear scraping, thumps, and hurried footsteps. Harry knocked and there was a sudden silence from inside. Then the door opened the tiniest crack and they saw one of Lockhart's eyes peering through it. \"Oh - Mr. Potter - Mr. Weasley -\" he said, opening the door a bit wider. \"I'm rather busy at the moment - if you would be quick -\" \"Professor, we've got some information for you,\" said Harry. \"We think it'll help you.\" \"Er - well - it's not terribly -\" The side of Lockhart's face that they could see looked very uncomfortable. \"I mean - well all right -\" He opened the door and they entered. His office had been almost completely stripped. Two large trunks stood open on the floor. Robes, jade-green, lilac, midnightblue, had been hastily folded into one of them; books were jumbled untidily into the other. The photographs that had covered the walls were now crammed into boxes on the desk. *296* \"Are you going somewhere?\" said Harry. \"Er, well, yes,\" said Lockhart, ripping a life-size poster of himself from the back of the door as he spoke and starting to roll it up. \"Urgent call - unavoidable - got to go -\" 254 \"What about my sister?\" said Ron jerkily. \"Well, as to that - most unfortunate -\" said Lockhart, avoiding their eyes as he wrenched open a drawer and started emptying the contents into a bag. \"No one regrets more than I -\" \"You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher!\" said Harry. \"You can't go now! Not with all the Dark stuff going on here!\" \"Well - I must say - when I took the job -\" Lockhart muttered, now piling socks on top of his robes. \"nothing in the job description - didn't expect -\" \"You mean you're running away?\" said Harry disbelievingly. \"After all that stuff you did in your books -\" \"Books can be misleading,\" said Lockhart delicately. \"You wrote them!\" Harry shouted. \"My dear boy,\" said Lockhart, straightening up and frowning at Harry. \"Do use your common sense. My books wouldn't have sold half as well if people didn't think Id done all those things. No one wants to read about some ugly old Armenian warlock, even if he did save a village from werewolves. He'd look dreadful on the front cover. No dress sense at all. And the witch who banished the Bandon Banshee had a harelip. I mean, come on -\" \"So you've just been taking credit for what a load of other people have done?\" said Harry incredulously. \"Harry, Harry,\" said Lockhart, shaking his head impatiently, \"it's not nearly as simple as that. There was work involved. I had *297* to track these people down. Ask them exactly how they managed to do what they did. Then I had to put a Memory Charm on them so they wouldn't remember doing it. If there's one thing I pride myself on, it's my Memory Charms. No, it's been a lot of work, Harry. It's not all book signings and publicity photos, you know. You want fame, you 255 have to be prepared for a long hard slog.\" He banged the lids of his trunks shut and locked them. \"Let's see,\" he said. \"I think that's everything. Yes. Only one thing left.\" He pulled out his wand and turned to them. \"Awfully sorry, boys, but I'll have to put a Memory Charm on you now. Can't have you blabbing my secrets all over the place. Id never sell another book -\" Harry reached his wand just in time. Lockhart had barely raised his, when Harry bellowed, \"Expelliarmus!\" Lockhart was blasted backward, falling over his trunk; his wand flew high into the air; Ron caught it, and flung it out of the open window. \"Shouldn't have let Professor Snape teach us that one,\" said Harry furiously, kicking Lockhart's trunk aside. Lockhart was looking up at him, feeble once more. Harry was still pointing his wand at him. \"What d'you want me to do?\" said Lockhart weakly. \"I don't know where the Chamber of Secrets is. There's nothing I can do.\" \"You're in luck,\" said Harry, forcing Lockhart to his feet at wandpoint. \"We think we know where it is. And what's inside it. Let's go.\" *298* They marched Lockhart out of his office and down the nearest stairs, along the dark corridor where the messages shone on the wall, to the door of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. They sent Lockhart in first. Harry was pleased to see that he was shaking. Moaning Myrtle was sitting on the tank of the end toilet. \"Oh, it's you,\" she said when she saw Harry. \"What do you want this time?\" 256 \"To ask you how you died,\" said Harry. Myrtle's whole aspect changed at once. She looked as though she had never been asked such a flattering question. \"Ooooh, it was dreadful,\" she said with relish. \"It happened right in here. I died in this very stall. I remember it so well. Id hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses. The door was locked, and I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in. They said something funny. A different language, I think it must have been. Anyway, what really got me was that it was a boy speaking. So I unlocked the door, to tell him to go and use his own toilet, and then -\" Myrtle swelled importantly, her face shining. \"I died.\" \"How?\" said Harry. \"No idea,\" said Myrtle in hushed tones. \"I just remember seeing a pair of great, big, yellow eyes. My whole body sort of seized up, and then I was floating away . . . .\" She looked dreamily at Harry. \"And then I came back again. I was determined to haunt Olive Hornby, you see. Oh, she was sorry she'd ever laughed at my glasses.\" \"Where exactly did you see the eyes?\" said Harry. *299* \"Somewhere there,\" said Myrtle, pointing vaguely toward the sink in front of her toilet. Harry and Ron hurried over to it. Lockhart was standing well back, a look of utter terror on his face. It looked like an ordinary sink. They examined every inch of it, inside and out, including the pipes below. And then Harry saw it: Scratched on the side of one of the copper taps was a tiny snake. \"That tap's never worked,\" said Myrtle brightly as he tried to turn it. \"Harry,\" said Ron. \"Say something. Something in Parseltongue.\" \"But -\" Harry thought hard. The only times he'd ever managed to 257 speak Parseltongue were when he'd been faced with a real snake. He stared hard at the tiny- engraving, trying to imagine it was real. \"Open up,\" he said. He looked at Ron, who shook his head. \"English,\" he said. Harry looked back at the snake, willing himself to believe it was alive. If he moved his head, the candlelight made it look as though it were moving. \"Open up,\" he said. Except that the words weren't what he heard; a strange hissing had escaped him, and at once the tap glowed with a brilliant white light and began to spin. Next second, the sink began to move; the sink, in fact, sank, right out of sight, leaving a large pipe exposed, a pipe wide enough for a man to slide into. Harry heard Ron gasp and looked up again. He had made up his mind what he was going to do. *300* \"I'm going down there,\" he said. . He couldn't not go, not now they had found the entrance to the Chamber, not if there was even the faintest, slimmest, wildest chance that Ginny might be alive. \"Me too,\" said Ron. There was a pause. \"Well, you hardly seem to need me,\" said Lockhart, with a shadow of his old smile. \"I'll just -\" He put his hand on the door knob, but Ron and Harry both pointed their wands at him. 258 \"You can go first,\" Ron snarled. White-faced and wandless, Lockhart approached the opening. \"Boys,\" he said, his voice feeble. \"Boys, what good will it do?\" Harry jabbed him in the back with his wand. Lockhart slid his legs into the pipe. \"I really don't think -\" he started to say, but Ron gave him a push, and he slid out of sight. Harry followed quickly. He lowered himself slowly into the pipe, then let go. It was like rushing down an endless, slimy, dark slide. He could see more pipes branching off in all directions, but none as large as theirs, which twisted and turned, sloping steeply downward, and he knew that he was falling deeper below the school than even the dungeons. Behind him he could hear Ron, thudding slightly at the curves. And then, just as he had begun to worry about what would happen when he hit the ground, the pipe leveled out, and he shot out of the end with a wet thud, landing on the damp floor of a dark stone tunnel large enough to stand in. Lockhart was getting to his *301 feet a little ways away, covered in slime and white as a ghost. Harry stood aside as Ron came whizzing out of the pipe, too. \"We must be miles under the school,\" said Harry, his voice echoing in the black tunnel. \"Under the lake, probably,\" said Ron, squinting around at the dark, slimy walls. All three of them turned to stare into the darkness ahead. \"Lumos!\" Harry muttered to his wand and it lit again. \"C'mon,\" he said to Ron and Lockhart, and off they went, their footsteps slapping loudly on the wet floor. The tunnel was so dark that they could only see a little distance ahead. 259 Their shadows on the wet walls looked monstrous in the wandlight. \"Remember,\" Harry said quietly as they walked cautiously forward, \"any sign of movement, close your eyes right away . ..... But the tunnel was quiet as the grave, and the first unexpected sound they heard was a loud crunch as Ron stepped on what turned out to be a rat's skull. Harry lowered his wand to look at the floor and saw that it was littered with small animal bones. Trying very hard not to imagine what Ginny might look like if they found her, Harry led the way forward, around a dark bend in the tunnel. \"Harry - there's something up there -\" said Ron hoarsely, grabbing Harry's shoulder. They froze, watching. Harry could just see the outline of something huge and curved, lying right across the tunnel. It wasn't moving. \"Maybe it's asleep,\" he breathed, glancing back at the other two. Lockhart's hands were pressed over his eyes. Harry turned back to look at the thing, his heart beating so fast it hurt. * 302 * Very slowly, his eyes as narrow as he could make them and still see, Harry edged forward, his wand held high. The light slid over a gigantic snake skin, of a vivid, poisonous green, lying curled and empty across the tunnel floor. The creature that had shed it must have been twenty feet long at least. \"Blimey,\" said Ron weakly. There was a sudden movement behind them. Gilderoy Lockhart's knees had given way. \"Get up,\" said Ron sharply, pointing his wand at Lockhart. Lockhart got to his feet - then he dived at Ron, knocking him to the ground. Harry jumped forward, but too late - Lockhart was straightening up, 260 panting, Ron's wand in his hand and a gleaming smile back on his face. \"The adventure ends here, boys!\" he said. \"I shall take a bit of this skin back up to the school, tell them I was too late to save the girl, and that you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body - say good-bye to your memories!\" He raised Ron's Spellotaped wand high over his head and yelled, \"Obliviate!\" The wand exploded with the force of a small bomb. Harry flung his arms over his head and ran, slipping over the coils of snake skin, out of the way of great chunks of tunnel ceiling that were thundering to the floor. Next moment, he was standing alone, gazing at a solid wall of broken rock. \"Ron!\" he shouted. \"Are you okay? Ron!\" \"I'm here!\" came Ron's muffled voice from behind the rockfall. \"I'm okay - this git's not, though - he got blasted by the wand =' *303* There was a dull thud and a loud \"ow!\" It sounded as though Ron had just kicked Lockhart in the shins. \"What now?\" Ron's voice said, sounding desperate. \"We can't get through - it'll take ages ...... Harry looked up at the tunnel ceiling. Huge cracks had appeared in it. He had never tried to break apart anything as large as these rocks by magic, and now didn't seem a good moment to try - what if the whole tunnel caved in? There was another thud and another \"ow!\" from behind the rocks. They were wasting time. Ginny had already been in the Chamber of Secrets for hours .... Harry knew there was only one thing to do. \"Wait there,\" he called to Ron. \"Wait with Lockhart. I'll go on.... If I'm not back in an hour. . . 261 There was a very pregnant pause, \"I'll try and shift some of this rock,\" said Ron, who seemed to be trying to keep his voice steady. \"So you can - can get back through. And, Harry -\" \"See you in a bit,\" said Harry, trying to inject some confidence into his shaking voice. And he set off alone past the giant snake skin. Soon the distant noise of Ron straining to shift the rocks was gone. The tunnel turned and turned again. Every nerve in Harry's body was tingling unpleasantly. He wanted the tunnel to end, yet dreaded what he'd find when it did. And then, at last, as he crept around yet another bend, he saw a solid wall ahead on which two entwined serpents were carved, their eyes set with great, glinting emeralds. *304* Harry approached, his throat very dry. There was no need to pretend these stone snakes were real; their eyes looked strangely alive. He could guess what he had to do. He cleared his throat, and the emerald eyes seemed to flicker. \"Open, \"said Harry, in a low, faint hiss. The serpents parted as the wall cracked open, the halves slid smoothly out of sight, and Harry, shaking from head to foot, walked inside. e was standing at the end of a very long, dimly lit chamber. Towering stone pillars entwined with more carved serpents rose to support a ceiling lost in darkness, casting long, black shadows through the odd, greenish gloom that filled the place. His heart beating very fast, Harry stood listening to the chill silence. Could the basilisk be lurking in a shadowy corner, behind a pillar? And where was Ginny? He pulled out his wand and moved forward between the serpentine columns. Every careful footstep echoed loudly off the shadowy walls. 262 He kept his eyes narrowed, ready to clamp them shut at the smallest sign of movement. The hollow eye sockets of the stone snakes seemed to be following him. More than once, with a jolt of the stomach, he thought he saw one stir. Then, as he drew level with the last pair of pillars, a statue high as the Chamber itself loomed into view, standing against the back wall. *306* Harry had to crane his neck to look up into the giant face above: It was ancient and monkeyish, with a long, thin beard that fell almost to the bottom of the wizard's sweeping stone robes, where two enormous gray feet stood on the smooth Chamber floor. And between the feet, facedown, lay a small, black-robed figure with flaming-red hair. \"tinny!\" Harry muttered, sprinting to her and dropping to his knees. \"tinny - don't be dead - please don't be dead -\" He flung his wand aside, grabbed Ginny's shoulders, and turned her over. Her face was white as marble, and as cold, yet her eyes were closed, so she wasn't Petrified. But then she must be \"Ginny, please wake up,\" Harry muttered desperately, shaking her. Ginny's head lolled hopelessly from side to side. \"She won't wake,\" said a soft voice. Harry jumped and spun around on his knees. A tall, black-haired boy was leaning against the nearest pillar, watching. He was strangely blurred around the edges, as though Harry were looking at him through a misted window. But there was no mistaking him \"Tom - Tom Riddle?\" Riddle nodded, not taking his eyes off Harry's face. \"What d'you mean, she won't wake?\" Harry said desperately. \"She's 263 not - she's not -?\" \"She's still alive,\" said Riddle. \"But only just.\" Harry stared at him. Tom Riddle had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago, yet here he stood, a weird, misty light shining about him, not a day older than sixteen. \"Are you a ghost?\" Harry said uncertainly. * 30 7* \"A memory,\" said Riddle quietly. \"Preserved in a diary for fifty years. He pointed toward the floor near the statue's giant toes. Lying open there was the little black diary Harry had found in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. For a second, Harry wondered how it had got there - but there were more pressing matters to deal with. \"You've got to help me, Tom,\" Harry said, raising Ginny's head again. \"We've got to get her out of here. There's a basilisk ... I don't know where it is, but it could be along any moment .... Please, help me -1) Riddle didn't move. Harry, sweating, managed to hoist Ginny half off the floor, and bent to pick up his wand again. But his wand had gone. \"Did you see -?\" He looked up. Riddle was still watching him - twirling Harry's wand between his long fingers. \"Thanks,\" said Harry, stretching out his hand for it. A smile curled the corners of Riddle's mouth. He continued to stare at Harry, twirling the wand idly. \"Listen,\" said Harry urgently, his knees sagging with Ginny's dead weight. \"We've got to go! If the basilisk comes -\" \"It won't come until it is called,\" said Riddle calmly. 264 Harry lowered Ginny back onto the floor, unable to hold her up any longer. \"What d'you mean?\" he said. \"Look, give me my wand, I might need it -\" Riddle's smile broadened. \"You won't be needing it,\" he said. *%08* Harry stared at him. \"What d'you mean, I won't be -?\" \"I've waited a long time for this, Harry Potter,\" said Riddle. \"For the chance to see you. To speak to you.\" \"Look,\" said Harry, losing patience, \"I don't think you get it. We're in the Chamber of Secrets. We can talk later -\" \"We're going to talk now,\" said Riddle, still smiling broadly, and he pocketed Harry's wand. Harry stared at him. There was something very funny going on here .... \"How did Ginny get like this?\" he asked slowly. \"Well, that's an interesting question,\" said Riddle pleasantly. \"And quite a long story. I suppose the real reason Ginny Weasley's like this is because she opened her heart and spilled all her secrets to an invisible stranger.\" \"What are you talking about?\" said Harry. \"The diary,\" said Riddle. `My diary. Little Ginny's been writing in it for months and months, telling me all her pitiful worries and woes - how her brothers tease her, how she had to come to school with secondhand robes and books, how\" -Riddle's eyes glinted \"how she 265 didn't think famous, good, great Harry Potter would ever like her . . . .\" All the time he spoke, Riddle's eyes never left Harry's face. There was an almost hungry look in them. \"It's very boring, having to listen to the silly little troubles of an elevenyear- old girl,\" he went on. \"But I was patient. I wrote back. I was sympathetic, I was kind. Ginny simply loved me. No one's ever understood me like you, Tom .... I'm so glad I've got this diary to *309* confide in .... It's like having a friend I can carry around in my pocket . . . . Riddle laughed, a high, cold laugh that didn't suit him. It made the hairs stand up on the back of Harry's neck. \"If I say it myself, Harry, I've always been able to charm the people I needed. So Ginny poured out her soul to me, and her soul happened to be exactly what I wanted .... I grew stronger and stronger on a diet of her deepest fears, her darkest secrets. I grew powerful, far more powerful than little Miss Weasley. Powerful enough to start feeding Miss Weasley a few of my secrets, to start pouring a little of my soul back into her. . .\" \"What d'you mean?\" said Harry, whose mouth had gone very dry. \" Haven't you guessed yet, Harry Potter?\" said Riddle softly. \"Ginny Weasley opened the Chamber of Secrets. She strangled the school roosters and daubed threatening messages on the walls. She set the Serpent of Slytherin on four Mudbloods, and the Squib's cat. \"No,\" Harry whispered. \"Yes,\" said Riddle, calmly. \"Of course, she didn't know what she was doing at first. It was very amusing. I wish you could have seen her new diary entries ... far more interesting, they became .... Dear Tom,\" he recited, watching Harry's horrified face, `I think I'm losing my memory. There are rooster feathers all over my robes and 1 don't know how they got there. Dear Tom, l can't remember what 1 did on the night of Halloween, but a cat was attacked and I've got paint all down my front. Dear Tom, Percy keeps telling me I'm pale and I'm not myself. I think he 266 suspects me... There was another attack today *310 and I don't know where I was. Tom, what am I going to do? I think I'm going mad... I think I'm the one attacking everyone, Tom!\" Harry's fists were clenched, the nails digging deep into his Palms. \"it took a very long time for stupid little Ginny to stop trusting her diary,\" said Riddle. \"But she finally became suspicious and tried to dispose of it. And that's where you came in, Harry. You found it, and I couldn't have been more delighted. Of all the people who could have picked it up, it was you, the very person I was most anxious to meet . . . .\" \"And why did you want to meet me?\" said Harry. Anger was coursing through him, and it was an effort to keep his voice steady. \"Well, you see, Ginny told me all about you, Harry,\" said Riddle. \"Your whole fascinating history. \" His eyes roved over the lightning scar on Harry's forehead, and their expression grew hungrier. \"I knew I must find out more about you, talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my famous capture of that great oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust -\" \"Hagrid's my friend,\" said Harry, his voice now shaking. \"And you framed him, didn't you? I thought you made a mistake, but -\" Riddle laughed his high laugh again. \"It was my word against Hagrid's, Harry. Well, you can imagine how it looked to old Armando Dippet. On the one hand, Tom Riddle, poor but brilliant, parentless but so brave, school prefect, model student ... on the other hand, big, blundering Hagrid, in trouble every other week, trying to raise werewolf cubs under his bed, sneaking off to the Forbidden Forest to wrestle trolls ... but I * 31:L * admit, even I was surprised how well the plan worked. I thought someone must realize that Hagrid couldn't possibly be the Heir of 267 Slytherin. It had taken me five whole years to find out everything I could about the Chamber of Secrets and discover the secret entrance ... as though Hagrid had the brains, or the power! \"Only the Transfiguration teacher, Dumbledore, seemed to think Hagrid was innocent. He persuaded Dipper to keep Hagrid and train him as gamekeeper. Yes, I think Dumbledore might have guessed .... Dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did ...... \"I bet Dumbledore saw right through you,\" said Harry, his teeth gritted. \"Well, he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after Hagrid was expelled,\" said Riddle carelessly. \"I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school. But I wasn't going to waste those long years Id spent searching for it. I decided to leave behind a diary, preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day, with luck, I would be able to lead another in my footsteps, and finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work.\" \"Well, you haven't finished it,\" said Harry triumphantly. \"No one's died this time, not even the cat. In a few hours the Mandrake Draught will be ready and everyone who was Petrified will be all right again -\" \"Haven't I already told you,\" said Riddle quietly, \"that killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore? For many months now, my new target has been -you.\" Harry stared at him. \"Imagine how angry I was when the next time my diary was *312* opened, it was Ginny who was writing to me, not you. She saw you with the diary, you see, and panicked. \"What if you found out how to work it, and I repeated all her secrets to you? What if, even worse, I told you who'd been strangling roosters? So the foolish little brat waited until your dormitory was deserted and stole it back. But I knew what I must do. It was clear to me that you were on the trail of Slytherin's heir. From everything Ginny had told me about you, I knew you would go to any lengths to solve the mystery -- 268 particularly if one of your best friends was attacked. And Ginny had told me the whole school was buzzing because you could speak Parseltongue .... \"So I made Ginny write her own farewell on the wall and come down here to wait. She struggled and cried and became very boring. But there isn't much life left in her .... She put too much into the diary, into me. Enough to let me leave its pages at last .... I have been waiting for you to appear since we arrived here. I knew you'd come. I have many questions for you, Harry Potter.\" \"Like what?\" Harry spat, fists still clenched. \"Well,\" said Riddle, smiling pleasantly, \"how is it that you a skinny boy with no extraordinary magical talent - managed to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed?\" There was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now. \"Why do you care how I escaped?\" said Harry slowly. \"Voldemort was after your time ...... \"Voldemort,\" said Riddle softly, \"is my past, present, and future, Harry Potter . . . .\" He pulled Harry's wand from his pocket and began to trace it through the air, writing three shimmering words: TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE Then he waved the wand once, and the letters of his name rearranged themselves: I AM LORD VOLDEMORT \"You see?\" he whispered. \"It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts, to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my filthy Muggle father's name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother's side? I, keep the name of a foul, common Muggle, who 269 abandoned me even before I was born, just because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry - I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!\" Harry's brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle, at the orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry's own parents, and so many others .... At last he forced himself to -,peak. \"You're not,\" he said, his quiet voice full of hatred. \"Not what?\" snapped Riddle. \"Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,\" said Harry, breathing fast. \"Sorry to disappoint you and all that, but the greatest wizard in the world is Albus Dumbledore. Everyone says so. Even when you were strong, you didn't dare try and take over at Hogwarts. Dumbledore saw through you when you were at school and he still frightens you now, wherever you're hiding these days -\" The smile had gone from Riddle's face, to be replaced by a very ugly look. *31-4* \"Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me!\" he hissed. \"He's not as gone as you might think!\" Harry retorted. He was speaking at random, wanting to scare Riddle, wishing rather than believing it to be true Riddle opened his mouth, but froze. Music was coming from somewhere. Riddle whirled around to stare down the empty Chamber. The music was growing louder. It was eerie, spine-tingling, unearthly; it lifted the hair on Harry's scalp and made his heart feel as though it was swelling to twice its normal size. Then, as the music reached such a pitch that Harry felt it vibrating inside his own ribs, flames erupted at the top of the nearest pillar. A crimson bird the size of a swan had appeared, piping its weird music 270 to the vaulted ceiling. It had a glittering golden tail as long as a peacock's and gleaming golden talons, which were gripping a ragged bundle. A second later, the bird was flying straight at Harry. It dropped the ragged thing it was carrying at his feet, then landed heavily on his shoulder. As it folded its great wings, Harry looked up and saw it had a long, sharp golden beak and a beady black eye. The bird stopped singing. It sat still and warm next to Harry's cheek, gazing steadily at Riddle. \"That's a phoenix said Riddle, staring shrewdly back at it. \"Fawkes?\" Harry breathed, and he felt the bird's golden claws squeeze his shoulder gently \"And that -\" said Riddle, now eyeing the ragged thing that Fawkes had dropped, \"that's the old school Sorting Hat -\" So it was. Patched, frayed, and dirty, the hat lay motionless at Harry's feet. Riddle began to laugh again. He laughed so hard that the dark chamber rang with it, as though ten Riddles were laughing at once \"This is what Dumbledore sends his defender! A songbird and an old hat! Do you feel brave, Harry Potter? Do you feel safe now?\" Harry didn't answer. He might not see what use Fawkes or the Sorting Hat were, but he was no longer alone, and he waited for Riddle to stop laughing with his courage mounting. \"To business, Harry,\" said Riddle, still smiling broadly. \"Twice - in your past, in my future - we have met. And twice I failed to kill you. How did you survive? Tell me everything. The longer you talk,\" he added softly, \"the longer you stay alive.\" Harry was thinking fast, weighing his chances. Riddle had the wand. He, Harry, had Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, neither of which would be much good in a duel. It looked bad, all right ... but the longer Riddle stood there, the more life was dwindling out of Ginny ... and in the 271 meantime, Harry noticed suddenly, Riddle's outline was becoming clearer, more solid .... If it had to be a fight between him and Riddle, better sooner than later. \"No one knows why you lost your powers when you attacked me,\" said Harry abruptly. \"I don't know myself But I know why you couldn't kill me. Because my mother died to save me. My common Muggle-born mother,\" he added, shaking with suppressed rage. \"She stopped you killing me. And I've seen the real you, I saw you last year. You're a wreck. You're barely alive. That's where all your power got you. You're in hiding. You're ugly, you're foul -\" *%16* Riddle's face contorted. Then he forced it into an awful smile. \"So. Your mother died to save you. Yes, that's a powerful countercharm. I can see now ... there is nothing special about you, after all. I wondered, you see. There are strange likenesses between us, after all. Even you must have noticed. Both half-bloods, orphans, raised by Muggles. Probably the only two Parselmouths to come to Hogwarts since the great Slytherin himself We even look something alike ... but after all, it was merely a lucky chance that saved you from me. That's all I wanted to know.\" Harry stood, tense, waiting for Riddle to raise his wand. But Riddle's twisted smile was widening again. \"Now, Harry, I'm going to teach you a little lesson. Let's match the powers of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against famous Harry Potter, and the best weapons Dumbledore can give him . . . .\" He cast an amused eye over Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, then walked away. Harry, fear spreading up his numb legs, watched Ridthe stop between the high pillars and look up into the stone face of Slytherin, high above him in the half-darkness. Riddle opened his mouth wide and hissed - but Harry understood what he was saying .... \"Speak to me, Slytherin, greatest of the Hogwarts Four. \" Harry wheeled around to look up at the statue, Fawkes swaying on his shoulder. 272 Slytherin's gigantic stone face was moving. Horrorstruck, Harry saw his mouth opening, wider and wider, to make a huge black hole. And something was stirring inside the statue's mouth. Something was slithering up from its depths. 3 1 Harry backed away until he hit the dark Chamber wall, and as he shut his eyes tight he felt Fawkes' wing sweep his cheek as he took flight. Harry wanted to shout, \"Don't leave me!\" but what chance did a phoenix have against the king of serpents? Something huge hit the stone floor of the Chamber. Harry felt it shudder - he knew what was happening, he could sense it, could almost see the giant serpent uncoiling itself from Slytherin's mouth. Then he heard Riddle's hissing voice: \"Kill him. \" The basilisk was moving toward Harry; he could hear its heavy body slithering heavily across the dusty floor. Eyes still tightly shut, Harry began to run blindly sideways, his hands outstretched, feeling his way - Voldemort was laughing Harry tripped. He fell hard onto the stone and tasted blood the serpent was barely feet from him, he could hear it coming There was a loud, explosive spitting sound right above him, and then something heavy hit Harry so hard that he was smashed into the wall. Waiting for fangs to sink through his body he heard more mad hissing, something thrashing wildly off the pillars He couldn't help it - he opened his eyes wide enough to squint at what was going on. The enormous serpent, bright, poisonous green, thick as an oak trunk, had raised itself high in the air and its great blunt head was weaving drunkenly between the pillars. As Harry trembled, ready to close his eyes if it turned, he saw what had distracted the snake. Fawkes was soaring around its head, and the basilisk was snapping furiously at him with fangs long and thin as sabers 273 Fawkes dived. His long golden beak sank out of sight and a *318* sudden shower of dark blood spattered the floor. The snake's tail thrashed, narrowly missing Harry, and before Harry could shut his eyes, it turned - Harry looked straight into its face and saw that its eyes, both its great, bulbous yellow eyes, had been punctured by the phoenix; blood was streaming to the floor, and the snake was spitting in agony. \"NO!\" Harry heard Riddle screaming. \"LEAVE THE BIRD! LEAVE THE BIRD! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU. YOU CAN STILL SMELL HIM. KILL HIMI\" The blinded serpent swayed, confused, still deadly. Fawkes was circling its head, piping his eerie song, jabbing here and there at its scaly nose as the blood poured from its ruined eyes. \"Help me, help me,\" Harry muttered wildly, \"someone - anyone The snake's tail whipped across the floor again. Harry ducked. Something soft hit his face. The basilisk had swept the Sorting Hat into Harry's arms. Harry seized it. It was all he had left, his only chance - he rammed it onto his head and threw himself flat onto the floor as the basilisk's tail swung over him again. Help me - help me - Harry thought, his eyes screwed tight under the hat. Please help me There was no answering voice. Instead, the hat contracted, as though an invisible hand was squeezing it very tightly. Something very hard and heavy thudded onto the top of Harry's head, almost knocking him out. Stars winking in front of his eyes, he grabbed the top of the hat to pull it off and felt something long and hard beneath it. 3 19 274 A gleaming silver sword had appeared inside the hat, its handle glittering with rubies the size of eggs. \"KILL THE BOY! LEAVE THE BIRD! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU. SNIFF -- SMELL HIM.\" Harry was on his feet, ready. The basilisk's head was falling, its body coiling around, hitting pillars as it twisted to face him. He could see the vast, bloody eye sockets, see the mouth stretching wide, wide enough to swallow him whole, lined with fangs long as his sword, thin, glittering, venomous - It lunged blindly -- Harry dodged and it hit the Chamber wall. It lunged again, and its forked tongue lashed Harry's side. He raised the sword in both his hands - The basilisk lunged again, and this time its aim was true -- Harry threw his whole weight behind the sword and drove it to the hilt into the roof of the serpent's mouth - But as warm blood drenched Harry's arms, he felt a searing pain just above his elbow. One long, poisonous fang was sinking deeper and deeper into his arm and it splintered as the basilisk keeled over sideways and fell, twitching, to the floor. Harry slid down the wall. He gripped the fang that was spreading poison through his body and wrenched it out of his arm. But he knew it was too late. White-hot pain was spreading slowly and steadily from the wound. Even as he dropped the fang and watched his own blood soaking his robes, his vision went foggy. The Chamber was dissolving in a whirl of dull color. A patch of scarlet swam past, and Harry heard a soft clatter of claws beside him. \"Fawkes,\" said Harry thickly. \"You were fantastic, Fawkes . . . .\" 1,520 He felt the bird lay its beautiful head on the spot where the serpent's fang had pierced him. 275 He could hear echoing footsteps and then a dark shadow moved in front of him. \"You're dead, Harry Potter,\" said Riddle's voice above him. \"Dead. Even Dumbledore's bird knows it. Do you see what he's doing, Potter? He's crying.\" Harry blinked. Fawke's head slid in and out of focus. Thick, pearly tears were trickling down the glossy feathers. \"I'm going to sit here and watch you die, Harry Potter. Take your time. I'm in no hurry.\" Harry felt drowsy. Everything around him seemed to be spinning. \"So ends the famous Harry Potter,\" said Riddle's distant voice. \"Alone in the Chamber of Secrets, forsaken by his friends, defeated at last by the Dark Lord he so unwisely challenged. You'll be back with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry... She bought you twelve years of borrowed time ... but Lord Voldemort got you in the end, as you knew he must . . . .\" If this is dying, thought Harry, it's not so bad. Even the pain was leaving him .... But was this dying? Instead of going black, the Chamber seemed to be coming back into focus. Harry gave his head a little shake and there was Fawkes, still resting his head on Harry's arm. A pearly patch of tears was shining all around the wound -- except that there was no wound \"Get away, bird,\" said Riddle's voice suddenly. \"Get away from him - I said, get away --\" Harry raised his head. Riddle was pointing Harry's wand at Fawkes; there was a bang like a gun, and Fawkes took flight again in a whirl of gold and scarlet. \"Phoenix tears. - .\" said Riddle quietly, staring at Harry's arm. \"Of course ... healing powers ... I forgot. . .\" 276 He looked into Harry's face. \"But it makes no difference. In fact, I prefer it this way. Just you and me, Harry Potter ... you and me.... He raised the wand Then, in a rush of wings, Fawkes had soared back overhead and something fell into Harry's lap -- the diary. For a split second, both Harry and Riddle, wand still raised, stared at it. Then, without thinking, without considering, as though he had meant to do it all along, Harry seized the basilisk fang on the floor next to him and plunged it straight into the heart of the book. There was a long, dreadful, piercing scream. Ink spurted out of the diary in torrents, streaming over Harry's hands, flooding the floor. Riddle was writhing and twisting, screaming and flailing and then He had gone. Harry's wand fell to the floor with a clatter and there was silence. Silence except for the steady drip drip of ink still oozing from the diary. The basilisk venom had burned a sizzling hole right through it. Shaking all over, Harry pulled himself up. His head was spinning as though he'd just traveled miles by Floo powder. Slowly, he gathered together his wand and the Sorting Hat, and, with a huge tug, retrieved the glittering sword from the roof of the basilisk's mouth. Then came a faint moan from the end of the Chamber. Ginny was stirring. As Harry hurried toward her, she sat up. Her bemused 1,522 eyes traveled from the huge form of the dead basilisk, over Harry, in his blood-soaked robes, then to the diary in his hand. She drew a great, shuddering gasp and tears began to pour down her face. \"Harry -- oh, Harry -- I tried to tell you at b-breakfast, but I c-couldn't say it in front of Percy -- it was me, Harry -- but I -- I s-swear I ddiddt mean to -- R-Riddle made me, he t-took me over -- and - how did you kill that -- that thing? W-where's Riddle? The last thing I rremember is him coming out of the diary --\" 277 \" It's all right,\" said Harry, holding up the diary, and showing Ginny the fang hole, \"Riddle's finished. Look! Him and the basilisk. C'mon, Ginny, let's get out of here --\" \"I'm going to be expelled!\" Ginny wept as Harry helped her awkwardly to her feet. \"I've looked forward to coming to Hogwarts ever since B-Bill came and n-now I'll have to leave and -- w-what'll Mum and Dad say?\" Fawkes was waiting for them, hovering in the Chamber entrance. Harry urged Ginny forward; they stepped over the motionless coils of the dead basilisk, through the echoing gloom, and back into the tunnel. Harry heard the stone doors close behind them with a soft hiss. After a few minutes' progress up the dark tunnel, a distant sound of slowly shifting rock reached Harry's ears. \"Ron!\" Harry yelled, speeding up. \"Ginny's okay! I've got her!\" He heard Ron give a strangled cheer, and they turned the next bend to see his eager face staring through the sizable gap he had managed to make in the rock fall. \"Ginny!\" Ron thrust an arm through the gap in the rock to pull 321,3 her through first. \"You're alive! I don't believe it! What happened?\" How - what -- where did that bird come from?\" Fawkes had swooped through the gap after Ginny. \"He's Dumbledore's,\" said Harry, squeezing through himself \"How come you've got a sword?\" said Ron, gaping at the glittering weapon in Harry's hand. \"I'll explain when we get out of here,\" said Harry with a sideways glance at Ginny, who was crying harder than ever. \"But --\" 278 \"Later,\" Harry said shortly. He didn't think it was a good idea to tell Ron yet who'd been opening the Chamber, not in front of Ginny, anyway. \"Where's Lockhart?\" \"Back there,\" said Ron, still looking puzzled but jerking his head up the tunnel toward the pipe. \"He's in a bad way. Come and see.\" Led by Fawkes, whose wide scarlet wings emitted a soft golden glow in the darkness, they walked all the way back to the mouth of the pipe. Gilderoy Lockhart was sitting there, humming placidly to himself. \"His memory's gone,\" said Ron. \"The Memory Charm backfired. Hit him instead of us. Hasn't got a clue who he is, or where he is, or who we are. I told him to come and wait here. He's a danger to himself\" Lockhart peered good-naturedly up at them all. \"Hello,\" he said. \"Odd sort of place, this, isn't it? Do you live here?\" \"No,\" said Ron, raising his eyebrows at Harry. Harry bent down and looked up the long, dark pipe. \"Have you thought how we're going to get back up this?\" he said to Ron. *324* Ron shook his head, but Fawkes the phoenix had swooped past Harry and was now fluttering in front of him, his beady eyes bright in the dark. He was waving his long golden tail feathers. Harry looked uncertainly at him. \"He looks like he wants you to grab hold. . .\" said Ron, looking perplexed. \"But you're much too heavy for a bird to pull up there -\" \"Fawkes,\" said Harry, \"isn't an ordinary bird.\" He turned quickly to the others. \"We've got to hold on to each other. Ginny, grab Ron's hand. Professor Lockhart --\" \"He means you,\" said Ron sharply to Lockhart. 279 \"You hold Ginny's other hand --\" Harry tucked the sword and the Sorting Hat into his belt, Ron took hold of the back of Harry's robes, and Harry reached out and took hold of Fawkes's strangely hot tail feathers. An extraordinary lightness seemed to spread through his whole body and the next second, in a rush of wings, they were flying upward through the pipe. Harry could hear Lockhart dangling below him, saying, \"Amazing! Amazing! This is just like magic!\" The chill air was whipping through Harry's hair, and before he'd stopped enjoying the ride, it was over -- all four of them were hitting the wet floor of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, and as Lockhart straightened his hat, the sink that hid the pipe was sliding back into place. Myrtle goggled at them. \"You're alive,\" she said blankly to Harry. \"There's no need to sound so disappointed,\" he said grimly, wiping flecks of blood and slime off his glasses. * 325* \"Oh, well ... Id just been thinking ... if you had died, you'd have been welcome to share my toilet,\" said Myrtle, blushing silver. \"Urgh!\" said Ron as they left the bathroom for the dark, deserted corridor outside. \"Harry! I think Myrtle's grown fond of you! You've got competition, Ginny!\" But tears were still flooding silently down Ginny's face. \"Where now?\" said Ron, with an anxious look at Ginny. Harry pointed. Fawkes was leading the way, glowing gold along the corridor. They strode after him, and moments later, found themselves outside Professor McGonagall's office. Harry knocked and pushed the door open. G F-I A P T E IR 280 k' I G 14 T V V N DO Y'$ REWARD or a moment there was silence as Harry, Ron, Ginny, and Lockhart stood in the doorway, covered in muck and slime and (in Harry's case) blood. Then there was a scream. \"Ginny!\" It was Mrs. Weasley, who had been sitting crying in front of the fire. She leapt to her feet, closely followed by Mr. Weasley, and both of them flung themselves on their daughter. Harry, however, was looking past them. Professor Dumbledore was standing by the mantelpiece, beaming, next to Professor McGonagall, who was taking great, steadying gasps, clutching her chest. Fawkes went whooshing past Harry's ear and settled on Dumbledore's shoulder, just as Harry found himself and Ron being swept into Mrs. Weasleys tight embrace. \"You saved her! You saved her! How did you do it?\" \"I think we'd all like to know that,\" said Professor McGonagall weakly. Mrs. Weasley let go of Harry, who hesitated for a moment, then walked over to the desk and laid upon it the Sorting Hat, the rubyencrusted sword, and what remained of Riddle's diary. Then he started telling them everything. For nearly a quarter of an hour he spoke into the rapt silence: He told them about hearing the disembodied voice, how Hermione had finally realized that he was hearing a basilisk in the pipes; how he and Ron had followed the spiders into the forest, that Aragog had told them where the last victim of the basilisk had died; how he had guessed that Moaning 281 Myrtle had been the victim, and that the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets might be in her bathroom .... \"Very well,\" Professor McGonagall prompted him as he paused, \"so you found out where the entrance was -- breaking a hundred school rules into pieces along the way, I might add - but how on earth did you all get out of there alive, Potter?\" So Harry, his voice now growing hoarse from all this talking, told them about Fawkes's timely arrival and about the Sorting Hat giving him the sword. But then he faltered. He had so far avoided mentioning Riddle's diary -- or Ginny. She was standing with her head against Mrs. Weasley's shoulder, and tears were still coursing silently down her cheeks. What if they expelled her? Harry thought in panic. Riddle's diary didn't work anymore .... How could they prove it had been he who'd made her do it all? Instinctively, Harry looked at Dumbledore, who smiled faintly, the firelight glancing off his half-moon spectacles. \"\\What interests me most,\" said Dumbledore gently, \"is how Lord Voldemort managed to enchant Ginny, when my sources tell me he is currently in hiding in the forests of Albania.\" *328* Relief -- warm, sweeping, glorious relief -- swept over Harry. \"Wwhat's that?\" said Mr. Weasley in a stunned voice. \"YouKnow-Who? En-enchant Ginny? But Ginny's not ... Ginny hasn't been ... has she?\" \"It was this diary,\" said Harry quickly, picking it up and showing it to Dumbledore. \"Riddle wrote it when he was sixteen . . . .\" Dumbledore took the diary from Harry and peered keenly down his long, crooked nose at its burnt and soggy pages. \"Brilliant,\" he said softly. \"Of course, he was probably the most brilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen.\" He turned around to the Weasleys, who were looking utterly bewildered. \"Very few people know that Lord Voldemort was once called Tom Riddle. I taught him myself, fifty years ago, at Hogwarts. He 282 disappeared after leaving the school ... traveled far and wide ... sank so deeply into the Dark Arts, consorted with the very worst of our kind, underwent so many dangerous, magical transformations, that when he resurfaced as Lord Voldemort, he was barely recognizable. Hardly anyone connected Lord Voldemort with the clever, handsome boy who was once Head Boy here.\" \"But, Ginny,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"What's our Ginny got to do with - with -- him?\" \"His d-diaryl\" Ginny sobbed. \"I've b-been writing in it, and he's been w-writing back all year --\" \"tinny!\" said Mr. Weasley, flabbergasted. \"Haven't I taught you anything. What have I always told you? Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can't see where it keeps its brain? Why didn't you show the diary to me, or your mother? A suspicious object like that, it was clearly full of Dark Magic =' *329* \"I d-didn't know,\" sobbed Ginny. \"I found it inside one of the books Mum got me. I th-thought someone had just left it in there and forgotten about it --\" \"Miss Weasley should go up to the hospital wing right away,\" Dumbledore interrupted in a firm voice. \"This has been a terrible ordeal for her. There will be no punishment. Older and wiser wizards than she have been hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort.\" He strode over to the door and opened it. \"Bed rest and perhaps a large, steaming mug of hot chocolate. I always find that cheers me up,\" he added, twinkling kindly down at her. \"You will find that Madam Pomfrey is still awake. She's just giving out Mandrake juice -- I daresay the basilisk's victims will be waking up any moment.\" \"So Hermione's okay!\" said Ron brightly. \"There has been no lasting harm done, Ginny,\" said Dumbledore. Mrs. Weasley led Ginny out, and Mr. Weasley followed, still looking deeply shaken. 283 \"You know, Minerva,\" Professor Dumbledore said thoughtfully to Professor McGonagall, \"I think all this merits a good feast. Might I ask you to go and alert the kitchens?\" \"Right,\" said Professor McGonagall crisply, also moving to the door. \"I'll leave you to deal with Potter and Weasley, shall I?\" \"Certainly,\" said Dumbledore. She left, and Harry and Ron gazed uncertainly at Dumbledore. What exactly had Professor McGonagall meant, deal with them? Surely - surely - they weren't about to be punished? \"I seem to remember telling you both that I would have to expel you if you broke any more school rules, said Dumbledore. *%30* Ron opened his mouth in horror. \"Which goes to show that the best of us must sometimes eat our words,\" Dumbledore went on, smiling. \"You will both receive Special Awards for Services to the School and -- let me see - yes, I think two hundred points apiece for Gryffindor.\" Ron went as briglitly pink as Lockhart's valentine flowers and closed his mouth again. \"But one of us seems to be keeping mightily quiet about his part in this dangerous adventure,\" Dumbledore added. \"Why so modest, Gilderoy?\" Harry gave a start. He had completely forgotten about Lockhart. He turned and saw that Lockhart was standing in a corner of the room, still wearing his vague smile. When Dumbledore addressed him, Lockhart looked over his shoulder to see who he was talking to. \"Professor Dumbledore,\" Ron said quickly, \"there was an accident down in the Chamber of Secrets. Professor Lockhart --\" \"Am I a professor?\" said Lockhart in mild surprise. \"Goodness. I expect I was hopeless, was I?\" 284 \"He tried to do a Memory Charm and the wand backfired,\" Ron explained quietly to Dumbledore. \"Dear me,\" said Dumbledore, shaking his head, his long silver mustache quivering. \"Impaled upon your own sword, Gilderoy!\" \"Sword?\" said Lockhart dimly. \"Haven't got a sword. That boy has, though.\" He pointed at Harry. \"He'll lend you one.\" \"Would you mind taking Professor Lockhart up to the infirmary, too?\" Dumbledore said to Ron. \"Id like a few more words with Harry ..... Lockhart ambled out. Ron cast a curious look back at Dumbledore and Harry as he closed the door. Dumbledore crossed to one of the chairs by the fire. \"Sit down, Harry,\" he said, and Harry sat, feeling unaccountably nervous. \"First of all, Harry, I want to thank you,\" said Dumbledore, eyes twinkling again. \"You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you.\" He stroked the phoenix, which had fluttered down onto his knee. Harry grinned awkwardly as Dumbledore watched him. \"And so you met Tom Riddle,\" said Dumbledore thoughtfully. \"I imagine he was most interested in you . . . . \" Suddenly, something that was nagging at Harry came tumbling out of his mouth. \"Professor Dumbledore ... Riddle said I'm like him. Strange likenesses, he said ...... \"Did he, now?\" said Dumbledore, looking thoughtfully at Harry from under his thick silver eyebrows. \"And what do you think, Harry?\" \"I don't think I'm like him!\" said Harry, more loudly than he'd intended. \"I mean, I'm -- I'm in Gryffindor, I'm . . .\" 285 But he fell silent, a lurking doubt resurfacing in his mind. \"Professor,\" he started again after a moment. \"The Sorting Hat told me Id -- Id have done well in Slytherin. Everyone thought I was Slytherin's heir for a while ... because I can speak Parseltongue .... \"You can speak Parseltongue, Harry,\" said Dumbledore calmly, \"because Lord Voldemort -- who is the last remaining ancestor *$32* of Salazar Slytherin -- can speak Parseltongue. Unless I'm much mistaken, he transferred some of his own powers to you the night he gave you that scar. Not something he intended to do, I'm sure .... \"Voldemort put a bit of himself in me?\" Harry said, thunderstruck. \"It certainly seems so.\" \"So I should be in Slytherin,\" Harry said, looking desperately into Dumbledore's face. \"The Sorting Hat could see Slytherin's power in me, and it --\" \"Put you in Gryffindor,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"Listen to me, Harry. You happen to have many qualities Salazar Slytherin prized in his handpicked students. His own very rare gift, Parseltongue - resourcefulness - determination -- a certain disregard for rules,\" he added, his mustache quivering again. \"Yet the Sorting Hat placed you in Gryffindor. You know why that was. Think.\" \"It only put me in Gryffindor,\" said Harry in a defeated voice, \"because I asked not to go in Slytherin . . . .\" `Exactly, \"said Dumbledore, beaming once more. \"Which makes you very different from Tom Riddle. It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.\" Harry sat motionless in his chair, stunned. \"If you want proof, Harry, that you belong in Gryffindor, I suggest you look more closely at this.\" Dumbledore reached across to Professor McGonagall's desk, picked up the blood-stained silver sword, and handed it to Harry. Dully, Harry 286 turned it over, the rubies blazing in the firelight. And then he saw the name engraved just below the hilt. Godric Gryffindor *333* \"Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat, Harry,\" said Dumbledore simply. For a minute, neither of them spoke. Then Dumbledore pulled open one of the drawers in Professor McGonagall's desk and took out a quill and a bottle of ink. What you need, Harry, is some food and sleep. I suggest you go down to the feast, while I write to Azkaban -- we need our gamekeeper back. And I must draft an advertisement for the Daily Prophet, too,\" he added thoughtfully. \"We'll be needing a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher... Dear me, we do seem to run through them, don't we?\" Harry got up and crossed to the door. He had just reached for the handle, however, when the door burst open so violently that it bounced back off the wall. Lucius Malfoy stood there, fury in his face. And cowering behind his legs, heavily wrapped in bandages, was Dobby. \"Good evening, Lucius,\" said Dumbledore pleasantly. Mr. Malfoy almost knocked Harry over as he swept into the room. Dobby went scurrying in after him, crouching at the hem of his cloak, a look of abject terror on his face. The elf was carrying a stained rag with which he was attempting to finish cleaning Mr. Malfoys shoes. Apparently Mr. Malfoy had set out in a great hurry, for not only were his shoes half-polished, but his usually sleek hair was disheveled. Ignoring the elf bobbing apologetically around his ankles, he fixed his cold eyes upon Dumbledore. \"So!\" he said \"You've come back. The governors suspended you, but 287 you still saw fit to return to Hogwarts.\" *%$4* \"Well, you see, Lucius,\" said Dumbledore, smiling serenely, \"the other eleven governors contacted me today. It was something like being caught in a hailstorm of owls, to tell the truth. They'd heard that Arthur Weasleys daughter had been killed and wanted me back here at once. They seemed to think I was the best man for the job after all. Very strange tales they told me, too .... Several of them seemed to think that you had threatened to curse their families if they didn't agree to suspend me in the first place.\" Mr. Malfoy went even paler than usual, but his eyes were still slits of fury. \"So -- have you stopped the attacks yet?\" he sneered. \"Have you caught the culprit?\" \"We have,\" said Dumbledore, with a smile. \"Well?\"said Mr. Malfoy sharply. \"Who is it?\" \"The same person as last time, Lucius,\" said Dumbledore. \"But this time, Lord Voldemort was acting through somebody else. By means of this diary.\" He held up the small black book with the large hole through the center, watching Mr. Malfoy closely. Harry, however, was watching Dobby. The elf was doing something very odd. His great eyes fixed meaningfully on Harry, he kept pointing at the diary, then at Mr. Malfoy, and then hitting himself hard on the head with his fist. \"I see. . . \" said Mr. Malfoy slowly to Dumbledore. \"A clever plan,\" said Dumbledore in a level voice, still staring Mr. Malfoy straight in the eye. \"Because if Harry here\" --Mr. Malfoy shot Harry a swift, sharp look -- \"and his friend Ron hadn't discovered this book, why -- Ginny Weasley might have taken all 288 *335* the blame. No one would ever have been able to prove she hadn't acted of her own free will ...... Mr. Malfoy said nothing. His face was suddenly masklike. \"And imagine,\" Dumbledore went on, \"what might have happened then .... The Weasleys are one of our most prominent pure-blood families. Imagine the effect on Arthur Weasley and his Muggle Protection Act, if his own daughter was discovered attacking and - killing Muggle-borns .... Very fortunate the diary was discovered, and Riddle's memories wiped from it. \"Who knows what the consequences might have been otherwise ...... Mr. Malfoy forced himself to speak. \"Very fortunate,\" he said stiffly. And still, behind his back, Dobby was pointing, first to the diary, then to Lucius Malfoy, then punching himself in the head. And Harry suddenly understood. He nodded at Dobby, and Dobby backed into a corner, now twisting his ears in punishment. \"Don't you want to know how Ginny got hold of that diary, Mr. Malfoy?\" said Harry. Lucius Malfoy rounded on him. \"How should I know how the stupid little girl got hold of it?\" he said. \"Because you gave it to her,\" said Harry. \"In Flourish and Blotts. You picked up her old Transfiguration book and slipped the diary inside it, didn't you?\" He saw Mr. Malfoy's white hands clench and unclench. \"Prove it,\" he hissed. \"Oh, no one will be able to do that,\" said Dumbledore, smiling at Harry. \"Not now that Riddle has vanished from the book. On 289 *336* the other hand, I would advise you, Lucius, not to go giving out any more of Lord Voldemort's old school things. If any more of them find their way into innocent hands, I think Arthur Weasley, for one, will make sure they are traced back to you ...... Lucius Malfoy stood for a moment, and Harry distinctly saw his right hand twitch as though he was longing to reach for his wand. Instead, he turned to his house-elf \"We're going, Dobby!\" He wrenched open the door and as the elf came hurrying up to him, he kicked him right through it. They could hear Dobby squealing with pain all the way along the corridor. Harry stood for a moment, thinking hard. Then it came to him - \"Professor Dumbledore,\" he said hurriedly. \"Can I give that diary back to Mr. Malfoy, please?\" \"Certainly, Harry,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"But hurry. The feast, remember ...... Harry grabbed the diary and dashed out of the office. He could hear Dobby's squeals of pain receding around the corner. Quickly, wondering if this plan could possibly work, Harry took off one of his shoes, pulled off his slimy, filthy sock, and stuffed the diary into it. Then he ran down the dark corridor. He caught up with them at the top of the stairs. \"Mr. Malfoy,\" he gasped, skidding to a halt, \"I've got something for you --\" And he forced the smelly sock into Lucius Malfoy's hand. \")What the --?\" Mr. Malfoy ripped the sock off the diary, threw it aside, then looked furiously from the ruined book to Harry. 290 *',531* You'll meet the same sticky end as your parents one of these days, Harry Potter,\" he said softly. \"They were meddlesome fools, too. He turned to go. \"Come, Dobby. I said, come.\" But Dobby didn't move. He was holding up Harry's disgusting, slimy sock, and looking at it as though it were a priceless treasure. \"Master has given a sock,\" said the elf in wonderment. \"Master gave it to Dobby.\" \"What's that?\" spat Mr. Malfoy. \"What did you say?\" \"Got a sock,\" said Dobby in disbelief. \"Master threw it, and Dobby caught it, and Dobby -- Dobby is free. \" Lucius Malfoy stood frozen, staring at the elf Then he lunged at Harry. \"You've lost me my servant, boy!\" But Dobby shouted, \"You shall not harm Harry Potter!\" There was a loud bang, and Mr. Malfoy was thrown backward. He crashed down the stairs, three at a time, landing in a crumpled heap on the landing below. He got up, his face livid, and pulled out his wand, but Dobby raised a long, threatening finger. \"You shall go now,\" he said fiercely, pointing down at Mr. Malfoy. \"You shall not touch Harry Potter. You shall go now.\" Lucius Malfoy had no choice. With a last, incensed stare at the pair of them, he swung his cloak around him and hurried out of sight. \"Harry Potter freed Dobby!\" said the elf shrilly, gazing up at Harry, moonlight from the nearest window reflected in his orb-like eyes. \"Harry Potter set Dobby free!\" 291 \"Least I could do, Dobby,\" said Harry, grinning. \"Just promise never to try and save my life again.\" The elf's ugly brown face split suddenly into a wide, toothy smile. \"I've just got one question, Dobby,\" said Harry as Dobby pulled on Harry's sock with shaking hands. \"You told me all this had nothing to do with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, remember? Well --\" \"It was a clue, sir,\" said Dobby, his eyes widening, as though this was obvious. \"Was giving you a clue. The Dark Lord, before he changed his name, could be freely named, you see?\" \"Right,\" said Harry weakly. \"Well, Id better go. There's a feast, and my friend Hermione should be awake by now ..... Dobby threw his arms around Harry's middle and hugged him. \"Harry Potter is greater by far than Dobby knew!\" he sobbed. \"Farewell, Harry Potter!\" And with a final loud crack, Dobby disappeared. Harry had been to several Hogwarts feasts, but never one quite like this. Everybody was in their pajamas, and the celebration lasted all night. Harry didn't know whether the best bit was Hermione running toward him, screaming \"You solved it! You solved it!\" or Justin hurrying over from the Hufflepuff table to wring. his hand and apologize endlessly for suspecting him, or Hagrid turning up at half past three, cuffing Harry and Ron so hard on the shoulders that they were knocked into their plates of trifle, or his and Ron's four hundred points for Gryffindor securing the House Cup for the second year running, or Professor McGonagall standing up to *339* tell them all that the exams had been canceled as a school treat (\"Oh, no!\" said Hermione), or Dumbledore announcing that, unfortunately, Professor Lockhart would be unable to return next year, owing to the fact that he needed to go away and get his memory back. Quite a few of the teachers joined in the cheering that greeted this news. 292 \"Shame,\" said Ron, helping himself to a jam doughnut. \"He was starting to grow on me.\" The rest of the final term passed in a haze of blazing sunshine. Hogwarts was back to normal with only a few, small differences - Defense Against the Dark Arts classes were canceled (\"but we've had plenty of practice at that anyway,\" Ron told a disgruntled Hermione) and Lucius Malfoy had been sacked as a school governor. Draco was no longer strutting around the school as though he owned the place. On the contrary, he looked resentful and sulky. On the other hand, Ginny Weasley was perfectly happy again. Too soon, it was time for the journey home on the Hogwarts Express. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny got a compartment to themselves. They made the most of the last few hours in which they were allowed to do magic before the holidays. They played Exploding Snap, set off the very last of Fred and George's Filibuster fireworks, and practiced disarming each other by magic. Harry was getting very good at it. They were almost at King's Cross when Harry remembered something. \"Ginny - what did you see Percy doing, that he didn't want you to tell anyone?\" *340* \"Oh, that,\" said Ginny, giggling. \"Well - Percy's got a girlfriend.\" Fred dropped a stack of books on George's head. \"What?\" \"It's that Ravenclaw prefect, Penelope Clearwater,\" said Ginny. \"That's who he was writing to all last summer. He's been meeting her all over the school in secret. I walked in on them kissing in an empty classroom one day. He was so upset when she was -- you know - attacked. You won't tease him, will you?\" she added anxiously. \"Wouldn't dream of it,\" said Fred, who was looking like his birthday had come early. 293 \"Definitely not,\" said George, sniggering. The Hogwarts Express slowed and finally stopped. Harry pulled out his quill and a bit of parchment and turned to Ron and Hermione. \"This is called a telephone number,\" he told Ron, scribbling it twice, tearing the parchment in two, and handing it to them. \"I told your dad how to use a telephone last summer - he'll know. Call me at the Dursleys', okay? I can't stand another two months with only Dudley to talk to ...... \"Your aunt and uncle will be proud, though, won't they?\" said Hermione as they got off the train and joined the crowd thronging toward the enchanted barrier. \"When they hear what you did this year?\" \"Proud?\" said Harry. \"Are you crazy? All those times I could've died, and I didn't manage it? They'll be furious ...... And together they walked back through the gateway to the Muggle world.

            ": The Unbreakable Vow Snow was swirling against the icy windows once more; Christmas was approaching fast. Hagrid had already singlehandedly delivered the usual twelve C hristmas trees to the Great Hall; garlands of holly and tinsel had been twisted around the banisters of the stairs; everlasting candles glowed from inside the helmets of suits of armor and great bunches of mistletoe had been hung at intervals along the corridors. Large groups of girls tended to converge underneath the mistletoe bunches every time Harry went past, which caused blockages in the corridors; fortunat e ly, however, Harry's frequent nighttime wanderings had given him an unusually good knowledge of the castle's secret passageways, so that he was often, without too much difficulty, to naviga t e mistletoe-free routes between classes. Ron, who might once have found the necessity of these detours excuse for jealousy rather than hilarity, simply roared with laughter about it all. Although Harry much preferred this new laughing, joking Ron to the moody, aggressive model he had been enduring for the last few weeks, the improved Ron came at a heavy price. Firstly, Harry had to put up with the frequent presence of Lavender Brown, who seemed to regard any moment that she was not kissing Ron as a moment wasted; and secondly, Harry found himself once more the best friend of two people who seemed unlikely ever to speak to each other again. Ron, whose hands and forearms still bore scratches and cuts from Hermione's bird attack, was taking a defensive and resentful tone. \"She can't complain,\" he told Harry. \"She snogged Krum. So she's found out someone wants to snog me too. Well, it's a free country. I haven't done anything wrong.\" Harry did not answer, but pretended to be absorbed in the book they were supposed to have read before Charms next morning (Quintessence: A Q uest). Determined as he was to remain friends with both Ron and Hermione, he was spending a lot of time with his mouth shut tight. \"I never promised Hermione anything , \" Ron mumbled. \"I mean, all right, I was going to go to Slughorn's Christmas party with her, but she never said... just as friends... I'm a free agent...\" Harry turned a page of Quintessence, aware that Ron was watching him. Ron's voice trailed away in mutters, barely audible over the loud crackling of the fire, though Harry thought he caught the words \"Krum\" and \"Can't complain\" again. Hermione's schedule was so full that Harry could only talk to her properly in the evenings, when Ron was, in any case, so tightly wrapped around Lavender that he did not notice what Harry was doing. Hermione refused to sit in the common room while Ron was there, So Harry generally joined her in the library, which meant that their conversations were held in whispers. \"He's at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes,\" said Hermione, while the librarian , Madam Pince, prowled the shelves behind them. \"I really couldn't care less.\" She raised her quill and dotted an 'i' so ferociously that she punctured a hole in her parchment. Harry said nothing. He thought his voice might soon vanish from the lack of use. He bent a little lower over Advanced Potion-Making and continued to make notes on Everlasting Elixirs, occasionally pausing to decipher the p rince's useful additions to Libatius B orage's text. \"And incidentally,\" said Hermione, after a few moments, \"you need to be careful.\" \"For the last time,\" said Harry, speaking in a slightly hoarse tone after three-quarters of an ho u r of silence, \"I am not giving back this book . I've learned more from the Half-blood p rince than Snape or Slughorn have taught me in--\" \"I'm not talking about your stupid so-called prince,\" said Hermione , giving his book a nasty look as though it had been rude to her. \"I'm talki ng about earlier. I went into the girl's bathroom just before I came in here and there were about a dozen girls in there, including that Romilda Vane , trying to decide how to slip you a love potion. They're all hoping they're going to get you to take them to Slughorn's party, and thay all seem to have bought Fred and George's love potions, which I'm afraid to say probably work --\" \"Why didn't you confiscate them then?\" demanded Harry, it seemed extraordinary that Hermione's m ania for upholding the rules could have abandoned her at this crucial juncture. \"They didn't have the potions with them in the bathroom,\" said Hermione scornfully, \"They were just discussing tactics. As I doubt the Half-blood prince\" she gave the book another scornful look \"could dream up an antidote for a dozen different love potions at once, I'd just invite someone to go with you, that'll stop all the others thinking they've still got a chance. It's tomor r ow night, they're getting desperate.\" \"There isn't anyone I want to invite,\" mumbled Harry, who was still not trying to think about Ginny any more than he could help, despite the fact the fact that she kept cropping up in his dreams in ways that made him devoutly thankful that Ron could not perform Legilimency. \"Well, just be careful what you drink, because Romilda Va ne looked like she meant business.\" said Hermione grimly. She hitched up the long roll of parchment on which she was writing her Arithma n cy essay and continued to scratch away with her quill. Harry wa t che d her with his mind a long way away. \"Hang on a moment,\" he said slowly. \"I thought Filch had banned anything bought at Weasley's Wizard Wheezes?\" \"And when has anyone ever paid attention to what Filch has banned?\" asked Hermione, still concentrating on her essay. \"But I thought all the owls were being searched. So how come these grils are able to bring love potions into the school?\" \"Fred and George send them disguised as perfumes and cough potions,\" said Hermione. \"It's part of their Owl order service.\" \"You know a lot about it.\" Hermione gave him the kind of nasty look she had just given his copy of Advanced Potion-Making. \"It was all on the back of the bottles they showed Ginny and me in the summer,\" she said coldly, \"I don't go around putting potions in people's drinks... or pretending too eit h er, which is just as bad...\" \"Yeah, well, never mind that,\" said Harry quickly. \"The point is, Filch is being fooled isn't he? These girls are getting stuff into the school disguised as something else! So why couldn't Malfoy have brought the necklace into the school --?\" \"Oh, Harry... not that again...\" \"Come on, why not?\" demanded Harry. \"Look , \" sighed Hermione, \"Secrecy Sensors detect jinxes, curses, and concealment charms, don't they? They're used to find d ark magic and d ark obje c ts. They'd have picked up a powerful curse , like the one in the necklace, withi n seconds. But something that's just been put in the wrong bottle wouldn ' t register -- anyway Love potions aren't d ark or dangerous -\" \"Easy for you to say,\" muttered Harry, thinking of Romilda Vane. \"-- so it would be down to Filch to realise it wasn't a cough potion, and he's not a very good wizard, I doubt he can tell one potion from --\" Hermione stopped dead; Harry had heard it too. Somebody had moved close behind them among the dark bookshelves. They waited, and a moment later the vulturelike countenance of Madam Pince appeared around the corner, her sunken cheeks, her skin like parchment, and her long hooked nose illuminated unflatteringly by the lamp she was carrying. \"The library is now closed,\" she said, \"Mind you return anything you have borrowed to the correct -- what have you been doing to that book, you depraved boy?\" \"It isn't the library's, it's mine!\" said Harry hastily, snatching his copy of Advanced Potion-Making off the table as she lunged at it with a clawlike hand. \" Spoiled!\" she hissed . \"Desecrated, befouled !\" \"It's just a book that's been written on!\" said Harry, tugging it out of her grip. She looked as though she might have a seizure; Hermione, who had hastily packed her things, grabbed Harry by the arm and frogmarched him away. \"She'll ban you from the library if you're not careful. Why did you have to bring that stupid book?\" \"It's not my fault she's barking mad, Hermione. Or d'you think she overheard you being rude about Filch? I've always thought there might be something between them...\" \"Oh, ha ha..\" Enjoying the fact that they could speak normally again, they made their way along the deserted lamp-lit corridors back to the common room, arguing w hether or not Filch and Madam Pince were secretly in love with each other. \"Baubles\" said Harry to the Fat Lady, this being the new, festive password. \"Same to you,\" said the fat lady with a roguish grin, and she swung forward to admit them. \"Hi, Harry!\" said Romilda Vane, the moment he had climbed through the portrait hole. \"Fancy a gillywater?\" Hermione gave him a \"what-did-I-tell-you?\" look over her shoulder. \"No thanks,\" said Harry quickly. \"I don't like it much.\" \"Well, take these anyway,\" said Romilda, thrusting a box into his hands. \"Chocolate Cauldrons, they've got firewhiskey in them. My gran sent them to me, but I don't like them.\" \"Oh-- right -- thanks a lot.\" said Harry, who could not think what else to say. \" Er-- I ' m just going over here with ...\" He hurried off behind Hermione, his voice tailing away feebly. \"Told you,\" said Hermione succinctly, \" Sooner you ask someone, sooner they'll all leave you alone and you can --\" But her face suddnly turned blank; she had just spotted Ron and Lavender, who were i ntertwined in the same armchair. \"Well, good night, Harry\" said Hermione, though it was only seven o'clock in the evening, and she left for the girl s' dormitory without another word. Harry went to bed comforting himself that there was only one more day of lessons to struggle through, plus Slughorn's party, after which he and Ron would depart together for the B urrow. It now seemed impossible that Ron and Hermione would make up with each other before the holidays began, but perhaps, somehow, the break would give them time to calm down, think better of their behavior... But his hopes were not high, and they sank still lower after enduring a Transfiguration lesson with them both next day. They had just embarked upon the immensely difficult topic of human transfiguration; working in front of mirrors , they were suposed to be changing the color of their own eyebrows. Hermione laughed unkindly at Ron's disastrous first attempt, during which he somehow managed to give himself a spectacular handlebar mustache; Ron retaliated by doing a cruel but accurate impression of Hermione jumping up and down in her seat every time Profe s sor McGonagall asked a question, which Lavender and Parvati found deeply amusing and which reduced Hermione to the verge of tears again. She raced out of the classroom on the bell, leaving half her things behind; Harry, deciding that her need was greater than Ron's just now, scooped up her remaining po ssessions and followed her. He finally tracked her down as she emerged from a girl's bathroom on the floor below. She was accompanied by Luna Lovegood, who was patting her vaguely on the back. \"Oh, hello, Harry , \" said Luna . \" D id you know one of your eyebrows is bright yellow?\" \"Hi, Luna. Hermione , you left your stuff...\" He held out her books. \"Oh, yes,\" said Hermione in a choked voice, taking her things and turning away quickly to hide the fact she was wiping her eyes with her pencil case. \"Thank you , Harry. Well, I'd better get going...\" And she hurried off, without ever giving Harry any time to offer words of comfort, though admittedly he could not think of any. \"She's a bit upset , \" said Luna. \"I thought at first it was Moaning Myrtle in there, but it turned out to be Hermione. She said something about Ron Weasley...\" \"Yeah, they've had a row,\" said Harry. \"He says funny things sometimes, doesn't he?\" said Luna as they set off down the corridor together. \"But he can be a bit unkind. I noticed that last year.\" \" I s'pose , \" said Harry. Luna was demonstrating her usual knack of speaking uncomfortable truths; he had never met anyone quite like her. \"So have you had a good term?\" \"Oh, it's been al l right,\" said Luna. \" A bit lonely without the D.A. Ginny's been nice, though. She stopped two boys in our Transfiguration class calling me 'Loony' the other day --\" \"How would you like to come to S lughorn's party with me tonight?\" The words were out of Harry's mouth before he could stop them; he heard himself say them as though it were a stranger speaking. Luna turned her protuberant eyes to him in surprise. \"Slughorn's party? With you?\" \"Yeah,\" said Harry, \"We're supposed to bring guests, so I thought you might like.. I mean...\" He was keen to make his intentions perfectly clear. \" I mean, just as friends, you know. But if you don't want to...\" He was already half hoping that she didn't want to. \"O h no, I'd love to go with you as friends!\" said Luna, beaming as he had never seen her beam before. \"Nobody's ever asked me to a party before, as a friend! Is that why you dyed your eyebrow, for the party? Should I dye mine too?\" \"No\" said Harry firmly, \"That was a mistake. I'll get Hermione to put it right for me. So I'll meet you in the entrance hall at eight o'clock then . \" \"AHA!\" screamed a voice from overhead and both of them jumped; unnoticed by either of them, they had just passed underneath Peeves, who was hanging upside down from a chandelier and grinning maliciously at them. \"Potty asked Loony to go to the part y ! Potty lurves Loony! Potty luuuuuurves Looooony!\" And he zoomed away cackling and shrieking, \"Potty loves Loony!\" \"Nice to keep these things private,\" said Harry. And sure enough, in no time at all the whole school seemed to know that Harry Potter was taking Luna Lovegood to Slughorn's party. \"You could've taken anyone!\" said Ron in disbelief over dinner. \"Anyone! And you chose Loony Lovegood?\" \"Don't call her that, Ron!\" snapped Ginny, pausing behind Harry on her way to join friends. \"I'm really glad you're taking her Harry, she's so excited.\" And she moved on down the table to sit with Dean. Harry tried to feel pleased that Ginny was glad he was taking Luna to the party but could not quite manage it. A long way along the table Hermione was sitting alone, playing with her stew. Harry noticed Ron looking at her furtively. \"You could say sorry , \" suggested Harry bluntly. \"What , and get attacked by another flock of canaries?\" muttered Ron. \"What did you have to imitate her for?\" \"She laughed at my mustache!\" \"So did I, it was the stupidest thing I've ever seen.\" But Ron did not seem to have he a rd; Lavender had just arrived with Parvati. Squeezing herself in between Harry and Ron, Lavender flung her arms around Ron's neck. \"Hi, Harry,\" said Parvati who, like Harry, looked faintly embarrassed and bored by the behavior of their two friends. \"Hi,\" said Harry, \"How're you? You're staying at Hogwarts, then? I heard your parents wanted you to leave.\" \"I managed to talk them out o f it for the time being,\" said Parvati. \"That Katie thing really freaked them out, but as there hasn't been anything since... Oh, hi, Hermione!\" Parvati positively beamed. Harry could tell that she was feeling guilty for having laughed at Hermione in Transfiguration. He looked around and saw that Hermione was beaming back, if possible even more brightly. Girls were very strange sometimes. \"Hi, Parvati!\" said Hermione, ignoring Ron and Lavender completely. \"Are you going to Slughorn's party tonight?\" \"No invite,\" said Parvati gloomily. \"I'd love to go, though, it sounds like it's going to be really good... You're going, aren't you?\" \"Yes, I'm meeting Cormac at eight, and we're -\" There was a noise like a plunger being withdrawn from a blocked sink , and Ron surfaced. Hermione acted as though she had not seen or heard anything. \"- we're going up to the party together.\" \"Cormac?\" said Parvati. \"Cormac McLaggen, you mean?\" \"That's right,\" said Hermione sweetly. \"The one who *almost*\" - she put a great deal of emphasis on the word - \"bec a me Gryffindor Keeper.\" \"Are you going out with him, then?\" asked Parvati, wide-eyed. \"Oh - yes - didn't you know?\" said Harmione, with a most un-Hermione-ish giggle. \"No!\" said Parvati, looking positively agog at thi s piece of gossip. \"Wow , you like your Quidditch players, don't you? First Krum, then McLaggen.\" \"I like *really good* Quidditch players,\" Hermione corrected her, still smiling. \"Well, see you... Got to go and get ready for the party...\" She left. At once Lavender and Parvati put their heads together to discuss this new development, with everything they had ever heard about McLaggen, and all they had ever guessed about Hermione. Ron looked strangely blank and said nothing. Harry was left to ponder in silence the depths to which girls would sink to get revenge. When he arrived in the entrance hall at eight o'clock that night, he found an unusually large number of girls lurking there, all of whom seemed to be staring at him resentfully as he approached Luna. She was wearing a set of spangled silver robes that were attracting a certain amount of giggles from the onlookers, but otherwise she looked quite nice. Harry was glad, in any case, that she had left off her radish earrings, her butterbeer cork necklace, and her Spectrespecs. \"Hi,\" he said. \"Shall we get going then?\" \"Oh yes,\" she said happily. \"Where is the party?\" \"Slughorn's office,\" said Harry, leading her up the marble staircase away from all the staring and muttering. \"Did you hear, there's supposed to be a vampire coming?\" \"Rufus Scrimgeour?\" asked Luna. \"I - what?\" said Harry, disconcerted. \"You mean the Minister of Magic?\" \"Yes, he's a vampire,\" said Luna matter-of-factly. \"Father wrote a very long article about it when Scrimgeour first took over from Cornelius Fudge, but he was forced not to publish by somebody from the Ministry. Obviously, they didn't want the truth to get out!\" Harry, who thought it most unlikely that Rufus Scrimgeour was a vampire, but who was used to Luna repeating her father's bizarre views as though they were fact, did not reply; they were already approaching Slughorn's office and the sounds of laughter, music, and loud conversation were growing louder with every step they took. Whether it had been built that way, or because he had used magical trickery to make it so, Slughorn's office was much larger than the usual teacher's study. The ceiling and walls had been draped with emerald, crimson , and gold hangings, so that it looked as though they were all inside a vast tent. The room was crowded and stuffy and bathed in the red light cast by an ornate golden lamp dangling from the center of the ceiling in which real fairies were fluttering, each a brilliant speck of light. Loud singing accompanied by what sounded like mandolins issued from a distant corner; a haze of pipe smoke hung over several elderly warlocks deep in conversation, and a number of house-elves were negotiating their way squeakily through the forest of knees, obscured by the heavy silver platters of food they were bearing, so that they looked like little roving tables. \"Harry, m'boy!\" boomed Slughorn, almost as soon as Harry and Luna had squeezed in through the door. \"Come in, come in, so many people I'd like you to meet!\" Slughorn was wearing a tasseled velvet hat to match his smoking jacket. Gripping Harry's arm so tightly he might have been hoping to Disapparate with him, Slughorn led him purposefully into the party; Harry seized Luna's hand and dragged her along with him. \"Harry, I'd like you to meet Eldred Worple, an old student of mine, author of ' Blood Brothers: My L ife Amongst the Vampires' - and, of course, his friend Sanguini.\" Worple, who was a small, stout, bespectacled man, grabbed Harry's hand and shook it enthusiastically; the vampire Sanguini, who was tall and emaciated with dark shadows under his eyes, merely nodded. He looked rather bored. A gaggle of girls was standing close to him, looking curious and excited. \"Harry Potter, I am simply delighted!\" said Worple, peering shortsightedly up into Harry's face. \"I was saying to Professor Slughorn only the other day, 'Where is the biography of Harry Potter for which we have all been waiting?'\" \"Er,\" said Harry, \"were you?\" \"Just as modest as Horace described!\" said Worple. \"But seri-ously\" -- his manner changed; it became suddenly businesslike -- \"I would be delighted to write it myself-- people are craving to know more about you, dear boy, craving! If you were prepared to grant me a few interviews, say in four- or five-hour sessions, why, we could have the book finished within months. And all with very little effort on your part, I assure you -- ask Sanguini here if it isn't quite -- Sanguini, stay here!\" added Worple, suddenly stern, for the vampire had been edging toward the nearby group of girls, a rather hungry look in his eye. \"Here, have a pasty,\" said Worple, seizing one from a passing elf and stuffing it into Sanguini's hand before turning his attention back to Harry. \"My dear boy, the gold you could make, you have no idea --\" \"I'm definitely not interested,\" said Harry firmly, \"and I've just seen a friend of mine, sorry.\" He pulled Luna after him into the crowd; he had indeed just seen a long mane of brown hair disappear between what looked like two members of the Weird Sisters. \"Hermione! Hermione !\" \"Harry! There you are, thank goodness! Hi, Luna !\" \"What's happened to you?\" asked Harry, for Hermione looked distinctly disheveled, rather as though she had just fought her way out of a thicket of Devil's Snare. \"Oh, I've just escaped -- I mean, I've just left Cormac,\" she said. \"Under the mistletoe,\" she added in explanation, as Harry continued to look questioningly at her. \"Serves you right for coming with him,\" he told her severely. \"I thought he'd annoy Ron most,\" said Hermione dispassion-ately. \"I debated for a while about Zacharias Smith, but I thought, on the whole --\" \"You considered Smith?\" said Harry, revoked. \"Yes, I did, and I'm starting to wish I'd chosen him, McLaggen makes Grawp look a gentleman. Let's go this way, we'll be able to see him coming, he's so tall. . . .\" The three of them made their way over to the other side of the room, scooping up goblets of mead on the way, realizing too late that Professor Trelawney was standing there alone. \"Hello,\" said Luna politely to Professor Trelawney. \"Good evening, my dear,\" said Professor Trelawney, focusing upon Luna with some difficulty. Harry could smell cooking sherry again. \"I haven't seen you in my classes lately. ..\" \"No, I've got Firenze this year,\" said Luna. \"Oh, of course,\" said Professor Trelawney with an angry, drunken titter. \"Or Dobbin, as I prefer to think of him. You would have thought, would you not, that now I am returned to the school Professor Dumbledore might have got rid of the horse? But no ... we share classes. . . . It's an insult, frankly, an insult. Do you know. . .\" Professor Trelawney seemed too tipsy to have recognized Harry. Under cover of her furious criticisms of Firenze, Harry drew closer to Hermione and said, \"Let ' s get something straight. Are you planning to tell Ron that you interfered at Keeper tryouts?\" Hermione raised her eyebrows. \"Do you really think I'd stoop that low?\" Harry looked at her shrewdly. \"Hermione, if you can ask 0111 McLaggen --\" \"There's a difference,\" said Hermione with dignity. \"I've got no plans to tell Ron anything about what might, or might not, have happened at Keeper tryouts.\" \"Good,\" said Harry fervently. \"Because he'll just fall apart again, and we'll lose the next match --\" \"Quidditch!\" said Hermione angrily. \"Is that all boys care about? Cormac hasn't asked me one single question about myself, no, I've just been treated to 'A Hundred Great Saves Made by Cormac McLaggen' nonstop ever since -- oh no, here he comes!\" She moved so fast it was as though she had Disapparated; one moment she was there, the next, she had squeezed between two guffawing witches and vanished. \"Seen Hermione?\" asked McLaggen, forcing his way through the throng a minute later. \"No, sorry,\" said Harry, and he turned quickly to join in Luna's conversation, forgetting for a split second to whom she was talking. \"Harry Potter!\" said Professor Trelawney in deep, vibrant tones, noticing him for the first time. \"Oh, hello,\" said Harry unenthusiastically. \"My dear boy!\" she said in a very carrying whisper. \"The rumors! The stories! 'The Chosen One'! Of course, I have known for a very long time. . . . The omens were never good, Harry. . . But why have you not returned to Divination? For you, of all people, the subject is of the utmost importance!\" \"Ah, Sybi l l, we all think our subject's most important!\" said a loud voice, and Slughorn appeared at Professor Trelawney s other side, his face very red, his velvet hat a little askew, a glass of mead in one hand and an enormous mince pie in the other. \"But I don't t hink I've ever known such a natural at Potions!\" said Slughorn, re-garding Harry with a fond, if bloodshot, eye. \"Instinctive, you know -- like his mother! I've only ever taught a few with this kind of ability, I can tell you that, Sybi l l -- why even Severus --\" And to Harry's horror, Slughorn threw out an arm and seemed to scoop Snape out of thin air toward them. \"Stop skulking and come and join us, Severus!\" hiccuped Slughorn happily. \"I was just talking about Harry's exceptional po-tion-making! Some credit must go to you, of course, you taught him for five years!\" Trapped, with Slughorns arm around his shoulders, Snape looked down his hooked nose at Harry, his black eyes narrowed. \"Funny, I never had the impression that I managed to teach Potter anything at all.\" \"Well, then, it's natural ability!\" shouted Slughorn. \"You should have seen what he gave me, first lesson, Draught of Living Death -- never had a student produce finer on a first attempt, I don't think even you, Severus --\" \"Really?\" said Snape quietly, his eyes still boring into Harry, who felt a certain disquiet. The last thing he wanted was for Snape to start investigating the source of his newfound brilliance at Potions. \"Remind me what other subjects you're taking, Harry?\" asked Slughorn . \"Defense Against the D ark Arts, Charms, Transfiguration , Herbology...\" \"All the subjects required, in short, for an Auror ,\" said Snap e with the faintest sneer. \"Yeah, well, that's what I'd like to do,\" said Harry defiantly. \"And a great one you'll make too!\" boomed Slughorn. \"I don't think you should be an Auror, Harry,\" said Luna unex pectedly. Everybody looked at her. \"The Aurors are part of the Rotfang Conspiracy, I thought everyone knew that. They're planning to bring down the Ministry of Magic from within using a c om bination of Dark Magic and gum disease.\" Harry inhaled half his mead up his nose as he started to lau gh. Really, it had been worth bringing Luna just for this. Emerging, from his goblet, coughing, sopping wet but still grinning, he saw something calculated to raise his spirits even higher: Draco Malf o y being dragged by the ear toward them by Argus Filch. \"Professor Slughorn,\" wheezed Filch, his jowls aquiver and the maniacal light of mischief-detection in his bulging eyes, \"I discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor. He claims to have been invited to your party and to have been delayed in setting out. Did you issue him with an invitation?\" Malfoy pulled himself free of Filchs grip, looking furious. \"All right, I wasn't invited!\" he said angrily. \"I was trying to gate crash, happy?\" \"No, I'm not!\" said Filch, a statement at complete odds with the glee on his face. \"You're in trouble, you are! Didn't the headma ster say that nighttime prowling ' s out, unless you've got permission, didn't he, eh?\" \"That's all right, Argus, that's all right,\" said Slughorn, waving it 1.1 nd. \"It's Christmas, and it's not a crime to want to come to a party . Just this once, we'll forget any punishment; you may stay , Draco. Fil ich's expression of outraged disappointment was perfectly pre di c t able; but why, Harry wondered, watching him, did Malfoy look almost equally unhappy? And why was Snape looking at Mal-foy as though both angry and . . . was it p ossible? ... a lit tl afraid? But almost before Harry had registered what he had seen, Filch had turned and shuffled away, muttering under his breath; Malfoy h ad composed his face into a smile and was thanking Slughorn for his generosity, and Snape's face was smoothly inscrutable again. \"It's nothing, nothing,\" said Slughorn, waving away Malfoy's t hanks. \"I did know your grandfather, after all....\" \"He always spoke very highly of you, sir,\" said Malfoy quickly. \"Said you were the best potion-maker he'd ever known. ...\" Harry stared at Malfoy. It was not the sucking-up that intrigued him; he had watched Malfoy do that to Snape for a long time. It was the fact that Malfoy did, after all, look a little ill. This was the first time he had seen Malfoy close up for ages; he now saw that Malfoy had dark shadows under his eyes and a distinctly grayish tinge to his skin. \"I'd like a word with you, Draco,\" said Snape suddenly. \"Now , Severus,\" said Slughorn, hiccuping again, \"it's Christ mas, do n't be too hard --\" \"I am his Head of House, and I shall decide how hard, or other-wise, to be,\" said Snape curtly. \"Follow me, Draco.\" They left, Snape leading the way, Malfoy looking resentful. Harry stood there for a moment, irresolute, then said, \"I'll be back in a bit, Luna -- er -- bathroom.\" \"All right,\" she said cheerfully, and he thought he heard her, as he hurried off into the crowd, resume the subject of the Rotfang Conspiracy with Professor Trelawney, who seemed sincerely in terested. It was easy, once out of the party, to pull his Invisibility Cloak out of his pocket and throw it over himself, for the corridor was quite deserted. What was more difficult was finding Snape and Malfoy. Harry ran down the corridor, the noise of his feet masked by the music and loud talk still issuing from Slughorn's office behind him. Perhaps Snape had taken Malfoy to his office in the dungeons ... or perhaps he was escorting him back to the Slyt herin common room. . . . Harry pressed his ear against door after door as he dashed down the corridor until, with a great jolt of excitement, he crouched down to the keyhole of the last classroom in the corridor and heard voices. \" . . . cannot afford mistakes, Draco, because if you are expelled --\" \"I didn't have anything to do with it, all right?\" \"I hope you are telling the truth, because it was both clumsy a nd foolish. Already you are suspected of having a hand in it.\" \"Who suspects me?\" said Malfoy angrily. \"For the last time, I didn't do it, okay? That Bell girl must ' ve had an enemy no on e knows about -- don't look at me like that! I know what you're do-ing, I'm not stupid, but it won't work -- I can stop you!\" There was a pause and then Snape said quietly, \"Ah . . . Aunt Bellatrix has been teaching you Occlumency, I see. What thoughts are you trying to conceal from your master, Draco?\" \"I'm not trying to conceal anything from him, I just don't want you butting in !\" Harry pressed his ear still more closely against the keyhole. . . . What had happened to make Malfoy speak to Snape like this -- Snape, toward whom he had always shown respect, even liking? \"So that is why you have been avoiding me this term? You have feared my interference? You realize that, had anybody else failed to come to my office when I had told them repeatedly to be there, Draco --\" \"So put me in detention! Report me to Dumbledore!\" jeered Malfoy. There was another pause. Then Snape said, \"You know perfectly well that I do not wish to do either of those things .\" \"You'd better stop telling me to come to your office then!\" \"Listen to me,\" said Snape, his voice so low now that Harry had to push his ear very hard against the keyhole to hear. \"I am trying to help you. I swore to your mother I would protect you. I made the Unbreakable Vow, Draco --\" \"Looks like you'll have to break it, then, because I don't need your protection! It's my job, he gave it to me and I'm doing it, I've got a plan and it's going to work, it's just taking a bit longer than I thought it would!\" \"What is your plan ?\" \"It's none of your business !\" \" If you tell me what you are trying to do, I can assist you ...\" \"I have all the assistance I need, thanks, I'm not alone!\" \"You were certainly alone tonight, which was foolish in the ex-treme, wandering the corridors without lookouts or backup, these are elementary mistakes --\" \"I would've had Crabbe and Goyle with me if you hadn't put them in detention!\" \"Keep your voice down!\" spat Snape, for Malfoy ' s voice had risen excitedly. \"If your friends Crabbe and Goyle intend to pass their Defense Against the Dark Arts OWL this time around, they will need to work a little harder than they are doing at pres --\" \"What does it matter?\" said Malfoy. \"Defense Against the Dark Arts -- its all just a joke, isn't it, an act? Like any of us need pro-tecting against the Dark Arts --\" \"It is an act that is crucial to success, Draco!\" said Snape. \"Where do you think I would have been all these years, if I had not known how to act? Now listen to me! You are being incautious, wandering around at night, getting yourself caught, and if you are placing your reliance in assistants like Crabbe and Goyle --\" \"They're not the only ones, I've got other people on my side, better people!\" \"Then why not confide in me, and I can --\" \"I know what you're up to! You want to steal my glory!\" There was another pause, then Snape said coldly, \"You are speaking like a child. I quite understand that your fathers capture and imprisonment has upset you, but --\" Harry had barely a second ' s warning; he heard Malfoy's footsteps on the other side of the door and flung himself out of the way just as it burst open . Malfoy was striding away down the corridor, past the open door of Slughorns office, around the distant corner, and out of sight. Hardly daring to breathe, Harry remained crouched down as Snape emerged slowly from the classroom. His expression unfath-omable, he returned to the party. Harry remained on the floor, hid-den beneath the cloak, his mind racing. \n",

            "-Three The Prince’s Tale Harry remained kneeling at Snape’s side, simply staring down at him, until quite suddenly a high, cold voice spoke so close to them that Harry jumped on his feet, the flask gripped tightly in his hands, thinking that Voldemort had reentered the room. Voldemort’s voice reverberated from the walls and floor, and Harry realized that he was talking to Hogwarts and to all the surrounding area, that the residents of Hogsmeade and all those still fighting in the castle would hear him as clearly as if he stood beside them, his breath on the back of their necks, a deathblow away. \"You have fought,\" said the high, cold voice, \"valiantly. Lord Voldemort knows how to value bravery. \"Yet you have sustained heavy losses. If you continue to resist me, you will all die, one by one. I do not wish this to happen. Every drop of magical blood spilled is a loss and a waste. \"Lord Voldemort is merciful. I command my forces to retreat immediately. \"You have one hour. Dispose of your dead with dignity. Treat your injured. \"I speak now, Harry Potter, directly to you. You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest. If, at the end of that hour, you have not come to me, have not given yourself up, then battle recommences. This time, I shall enter the fray myself, Harry Potter, and I shall find you, and I shall punish every last man, woman, and child who has tried to conceal you from me. One hour.\" Both Ron and Hermione shook their heads frantically, looking at Harry. \"Don’t listen to him,\" said Ron. \"It’ll be all right,\" said Hermione wildly. \"Let’s - let’s get back to the castle, if he’s gone to the forest we’ll need to think of a new plan - \" She glanced at Snape’s body, then hurried back to the tunnel entrance. Ron followed her. Harry gathered up the Invisibility Cloak, then looked down at Snape. He did not know what to feel, except shock at the way Snape had been killed, and the reason for which it had been done... They crawled back through the tunnel, none of them talking, and Harry wondered whether Ron and Hermione could still hear Voldemort ringing in their heads as he could. You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest...One hour... Small bundles seemed to litter the lawn at the front of the castle (?). It could only be an hour or so from dawn, yet it was pitch-black. The three of them hurried toward the stone steps. A lone dog, the size of a small boat, lay abandoned in front of them. There was no other sign of Grawp or of his attacker. The castle was unnaturally silent. There were no flashes of light now, no bangs or screams or shouts. The flagstones of the deserted entrance hall were stained with blood. Emeralds were still scattered all over the floor, along with pieces of marble and splintered wood. Part of the banisters had been blown away. \"Where is everyone?\" whispered Hermione. Ron led the way to the Great Hall. Harry stopped in the doorway. The House tables were gone and the room was crowded. The survivors stood in groups, their arms around each other’s necks. The injured were being treated upon the raised platform by Madam Pomfrey and a group of helpers. Firenze was amongst the injured; his flank poured blood and he shook where he lay, unable to stand. The dead lay in a row in the middle of the Hall. Harry could not see Fred’s body, because his family surrounded him. George was kneeling at his head; Mrs. Weasley was lying across Fred’s chest, her body shaking. Mr. Weasley stroking her hair while tears cascaded down his cheeks. Without a word to Harry, Ron and Hermione walked away. Harry saw Hermione approach Ginny, whose face was swollen and blotchy, and hug her. Ron joined Bill, Fleur, and Percy, who flung an arm around Ron’s shoulders. As Ginny and Hermione moved closer to the rest of the family, Harry had a clear view of the bodies lying next to Fred. Remus and Tonks, pale and still and peaceful-looking, apparently asleep beneath the dark, enchanted ceiling. The Great Hall seemed to fly away, become smaller, shrink, as Harry reeled backward from the doorway. He could not draw breath. He could not bear to look at any of the other bodies, to see who else had died for him. He could not bear to join the Weasleys, could not look into their eyes, when if he had given himself up in the first place, Fred might never have died... He turned away and ran up the marble staircase. Lupin, Tonks... He yearned not to feel... He wished he could rip out his heart, his innards, everything that was screaming inside him... The castle was completely empty; even the ghosts seemed to have joined the mass mourning in the Great Hall. Harry ran without stopping, clutching the crystal flask of Snape’s last thoughts, and he did not slow down until he reached the stone gargoyle guarding the headmaster’s office. \"Password?\" \"Dumbledore!\" said Harry without thinking, because it was he whom he yearned to see, and to his surprise the gargoyle slid aside revealing the spiral staircase behind. But when Harry burst into the circular office he found a change. The portraits that hung all around the walls were empty. Not a single headmaster or headmistress remained to see him; all, it seemed, had flitted away, charging through the paintings that lined the castle so that they could have a clear view of what was going on. Harry glanced hopelessly at Dumbledore’s deserted frame, which hung directly behind the headmaster’s chair, then turned his back on it. The stone Pensieve lay in the cabinet where it had always been. Harry heaved it onto the desk and poured Snape’s memories into the wide basin with its runic markings around the edge. To escape into someone else’s head would be a blessed relief... Nothing that even Snape had left him could be worse than his own thoughts. The memories swirled, silver white and strange, and without hesitating, with a feeling of reckless abandonment, as though this would assuage his torturing grief, Harry dived. He fell headlong into sunlight, and his feet found warm ground. When he straightened up, he saw that he was in a nearly deserted playground. A single huge chimney dominated the distant skyline. Two girls were swinging backward and forward, and a skinny boy was watching them from behind a clump of bushes. His black hair was overlong and his clothes were so mismatched that it looked deliberate: too short jeans, a shabby, overlarge coat that might have belonged to a grown man, an odd smocklike shirt. Harry moved closer to the boy. Snape looked no more than nine or ten years old, sallow, small, stringy. There was undisguised greed in his thin face as he watched the younger of the two girls swinging higher and higher than her sister. \"Lily, don’t do it!\" shrieked the elder of the two. But the girl had let go of the swing at the very height of its arc and flown into the air, quite literally flown, launched herself skyward with a great shout of laughter, and instead of crumpling on the playground asphalt, she soared like a trapeze artist through the air, staying up far too long, landing far too lightly. \"Mummy told you not to!\" Petunia stopped her swing by dragging the heels of her sandals on the ground, making a crunching, grinding sound, then leapt up, hands on hips. \"Mummy said you weren’t allowed, Lily!\" \"But I’m fine,\" said Lily, still giggling. \"Tuney, look at this. Watch what I can do.\" Petunia glanced around. The playground was deserted apart from themselves and, though the girls did not know it, Snape. Lily had picked up a fallen flower from the bush behind which Snape lurked. Petunia advanced, evidently torn between curiosity and disapproval. Lily waited until Petunia was near enough to have a clear view, then held out her palm. The flower sat there, opening and closing its petals, like some bizarre, many-lipped oyster. \"Stop it!\" shrieked Petunia. \"It’s not hurting you,\" said Lily, but she closed her hand on the blossom and threw it back to the ground. \"It’s not right,\" said Petunia, but her eyes had followed the flower’s flight to the ground and lingered upon it. \"How do you do it?\" she added, and there was definite longing in her voice. \"It’s obvious, isn’t it?\" Snape could no longer contain himself, but had jumped out from behind the bushes. Petunia shrieked and ran backward toward the swings, but Lily, though clearly startled, remained where she was. Snape seemed to regret his appearance. A dull flush of color mounted the sallow cheeks as he looked at Lily. \"What’s obvious?\" asked Lily. Snape had an air of nervous excitement. With a glance at the distant Petunia, now hovering beside the swings, he lowered his voice and said, \"I know what you are.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"You’re...you’re a witch,\" whispered Snape. She looked affronted. \"That’s not a very nice thing to say to somebody!\" She turned, nose in the air, and marched off toward her sister. \"No!\" said Snape. He was highly colored now, and Harry wondered why he did not take off the ridiculously large coat, unless it was because he did not want to reveal the smock beneath it. He flapped after the girls, looking ludicrously batlike, like his older self. The sisters considered him, united in disapproval, both holding on to one of the swing poles, as though it was the safe place in tag. \"You are,\" said Snape to Lily. \"You are a witch. I’ve been watching you for a while. But there’s nothing wrong with that. My mum’s one, and I’m a wizard.\" Petunia’s laugh was like cold water. \"Wizard!\" she shrieked, her courage returned now that she had recovered from the shock of his unexpected appearance. \"I know who you are. You’re that Snape boy! They live down Spinner’s End by the river,\" she told Lily, and it was evident from her tone that she considered the address a poor recommendation. \"Why have you been spying on us?\" \"Haven’t been spying,\" said Snape, hot and uncomfortable and dirty-haired in the bright sunlight. \"Wouldn’t spy on you, anyway,\" he added spitefully, \"you’re a Muggle.\" Though Petunia evidently did not understand the word, she could hardly mistake the tone. \"Lily, come on, we’re leaving!\" she said shrilly. Lily obeyed her sister at once, glaring at Snape as she left. He stood watching them as they marched through the playground gate, and Harry, the only one left to observe him, recognized Snape’s bitter disappointment, and understood that Snape had been planning this moment for a while, and that it had all gone wrong... The scene dissolved, and before Harry knew it, re-formed around him. He was now in a small thicket of trees. He could see a sunlit river glittering through their trunks. The shadows cast by the trees made a basin of cool green shade. Two children sat facing each other, cross-legged on the ground. Snape had removed his coat now; his odd smock looked less pecular in the half light. \"...and the Ministry can punish you if you do magic outside school, you get letters.\" \"But I have done magic outside school!\" \"We’re all right. We haven’t got wands yet. They let you off when you’re a kid and you can’t help it. But once you’re eleven,\" he nodded importantly, \"and they start training you, then you’ve got to go careful.\" There was a little silence. Lily had picked up a fallen twig and twirled it in the air, and Harry knew that she was imagining sparks trailing from it. Then she dropped the twig, leaned in toward the boy, and said, \"It is real, isn’t it? It’s not a joke? Petunia says you’re lying to me. Petunia says there isn’t a Hogwarts. It is real, isn’t it?\" \"It’s real for us,\" said Snape. \"Not for her. But we’ll get the letter, you and me.\" \"Really?\" whispered Lily. \"Definitely,\" said Snape, and even with his poorly cut hair and his odd clothes, he struck an oddly impressive figure sprawled in front of her, brimful of confidence in his destiny. \"And will it really come by owl?\" Lily whispered. \"Normally,\" said Snape. \"But you’re Muggle-born, so someone from the school will have to come and explain to your parents.\" \"Does it make a difference, being Muggle-born?\" Snape hesitated. His black eyes, eager in the greenish gloom, moved over the pale face, the dark red hair. \"No,\" he said. \"It doesn’t make any difference.\" \"Good,\" said Lily, relaxing. It was clear that she had been worrying. \"You’ve got loads of magic,\" said Snape. \"I saw that. All the time I was watching you...\" His voice trailed away; she was not listening, but had stretched out on the leafy ground and was looking up at the canopy of leaves overhead. He watched her as greedily as he had watched her in the playground. \"How are things at your house?\" Lily asked. A little crease appeared between his eyes. \"Fine,\" he said. \"They’re not arguing anymore?\" \"Oh yes, they’re arguing,\" said Snape. He picked up a fistful of leaves and began tearing them apart, apparently unaware of what he was doing. \"But it won’t be that long and I’ll be gone.\" \"Doesn’t your dad like magic?\" \"He doesn’t like anything, much,\" said Snape. \"Severus?\" A little smile twisted Snape’s mouth when she said his name. \"Yeah?\" \"Tell me about the dementors again.\" \"What d’you want to know about them for?\" \"If I use magic outside school - \" \"They wouldn’t give you to the dementors for that! Dementors are for people who do really bad stuff. They guard the wizard prison, Azkaban. You’re not going to end up in Azkaban, you’re too - \" He turned red again and shredded more leaves. Then a small rustling noise behind Harry made him turn: Petunia, hiding behind a tree, had lost her footing. \"Tuney!\" said Lily, surprise and welcome in her voice, but Snape had jumped to his feet. \"Who’s spying now?\" he shouted. \"What d’you want?\" Petunia was breathless, alarmed at being caught. Harry could see her struggling for something hurtful to say. \"What is that you’re wearing, anyway?\" she said, pointing at Snape’s chest. \"Your mum’s blouse?\" There was a crack. A branch over Petunia’s head had fallen. Lily screamed. The branch caught Petunia on the shoulder, and she staggered backward and burst into tears. \"Tuney!\" But Petunia was running away. Lily rounded on Snape. \"Did you make that happen?\" \"No.\" He looked both defiant and scared. \"You did!\" She was backing away from him. \"You did! You hurt her!\" \"No - no, I didn’t!\" But the lie did not convince Lily. After one last burning look, she ran from the little thicket, off after her sister, and Snape looked miserable and confused... And the scene re-formed. Harry looked around. He was on platform nine and three quarters, and Snape stood beside him, slightly hunched, next to a thin, sallow-faced, sour-looking woman who greatly resembled him. Snape was staring at a family of four a short distance away. The two girls stood a little apart from their parents. Lily seemed to be pleading with her sister. Harry moved closer to listen. \"...I’m sorry, Tuney, I’m sorry! Listen - \" She caught her sister’s hand and held tight to it, even though Petunia tried to pull it away. \"Maybe once I’m there - no, listen, Tuney! Maybe once I’m there, I’ll be able to go to Professor Dumbledore and persuade him to change his mind!\" \"I don’t - want - to - go!\" said Petunia, and she dragged her hand back out of her sister’s grasp. \"You think I want to go to some stupid castle and learn to be a - a...\" Her pale eyes roved over the platform, over the cats mewling in their owners’ arms, over the owls, fluttering and hooting at each other in cages, over the students, some already in their long black robes, loading trunks onto the scarlet steam engine or else greeting one another with glad cries after a summer apart. \" - you think I want to be a - a freak?\" Lily’s eyes filled with tears as Petunia succeeded in tugging her hand away. \"I’m not a freak,\" said Lily. \"That’s a horrible thing to say.\" \"That’s where you’re going,\" said Petunia with relish. \"A special school for freaks. You and that Snape boy...weirdos, that’s what you two are. It’s good you’re being separated from normal people. It’s for our safety.\" Lily glanced toward her parents, who were looking around the platform with an air of wholehearted enjoyment, drinking in the scene. Then she looked back at her sister, and her voice was low and fierce. \"You didn’t think it was such a freak’s school when you wrote to the headmaster and begged him to take you.\" Petunia turned scarlet. \"Beg? I didn’t beg!\" \"I saw his reply. It was very kind.\" \"You shouldn’t have read - \" whispered Petunia, \"that was my private - how could you - ?\" Lily gave herself away by half-glancing toward where Snape stood nearby. Petunia gasped. \"That boy found it! You and that boy have been sneaking in my room!\" \"No - not sneaking - \" Now Lily was on the defensive. \"Severus saw the envelope, and he couldn’t believe a Muggle could have contacted Hogwarts, that’s all! He says there must be wizards working undercover in the postal service who take care of - \" \"Apparently wizards poke their noses in everywhere!\" said Petunia, now as pale as she had been flushed. \"Freak!\" she spat at her sister, and she flounced off to where her parents stood... The scene dissolved again. Snape was hurrying along the corridor of the Hogwarts Express as it clattered through the countryside. He had already changed into his school robes, had perhaps taken the first opportunity to take off his dreadful Muggle clothes. At last he stopped, outside a compartment in which a group of rowdy boys were talking. Hunched in a corner seat beside the window was Lily, her face pressed against the windowpane. Snape slid open the compartment door and sat down opposite Lily. She glanced at him and then looked back out of the window. She had been crying. \"I don’t want to talk to you,\" she said in a constricted voice. \"Why not?\" \"Tuney h-hates me. Because we saw that letter from Dumbledore.\" \"So what?\" She threw him a look of deep dislike. \"So she’s my sister!\" \"She’s only a - \" He caught himself quickly; Lily, too busy trying to wipe her eyes without being noticed, did not hear him. \"But we’re going!\" he said, unable to suppress the exhilaration in his voice. \"This is it! We’re off to Hogwarts!\" She nodded, mopping her eyes, but in spite of herself, she half smiled. \"You’d better be in Slytherin,\" said Snape, encouraged that she had brightened a little. \"Slytherin?\" One of the boys sharing the compartment, who had shown no interest at all in Lily or Snape until that point, looked around at the word, and Harry, whose attention had been focused entirely on the two beside the window, saw his father: slight, black-haired like Snape, but with that indefinable air of having been well-cared-for, even adored, that Snape so conspicuously lacked. \"Who wants to be in Slytherin? I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you?\" James asked the boy lounging on the seats opposite him, and with a jolt, Harry realized that it was Sirius. Sirius did not smile. \"My whole family have been in Slytherin,\" he said. \"Blimey,\" said James, \"and I thought you seemed all right!\" Sirius grinned. \"Maybe I’ll break the tradition. Where are you heading, if you’ve got the choice?\" James lifted an invisible sword. \"‘Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart!’ Like my dad.\" Snape made a small, disparaging noise. James turned on him. \"Got a problem with that?\" \"No,\" said Snape, though his slight sneer said otherwise. \"If you’d rather be brawny than brainy - \" \"Where’re you hoping to go, seeing as you’re neither?\" interjected Sirius. James roared with laughter. Lily sat up, rather flushed, and looked from James to Sirius in dislike. \"Come on, Severus, let’s find another compartment.\" \"Oooooo...\" James and Sirius imitated her lofty voice; James tried to trip Snape as he passed. \"See ya, Snivellus!\" a voice called, as the compartment door slammed... And the scene dissolved once more... Harry was standing right behind Snape as they faced the candlelit House tables, lined with rapt faces. Then Professor McGonagall said, \"Evans, Lily!\" He watched his mother walk forward on trembling legs and sit down upon the rickety stool. Professor McGonagall dropped the Sorting Hat onto her head, and barely a second after it had touched the dark red hair, the hat cried, \"Gryffindor!\" Harry heard Snape let out a tiny groan. Lily took off the hat, handed it back to Professor McGonagall, then hurried toward the cheering Gryffindors, but as she went she glanced back at Snape, and there was a sad little smile on her face. Harry saw Sirius move up the bench to make room for her. She took one look at him, seemed to recognize him from the train, folded her arms, and firmly turned her back on him. The roll call continued. Harry watched Lupin, Pettigrew, and his father join Lily and Sirius at the Gryffindor table. At last, when only a dozen students remained to be sorted, Professor McGonagall called Snape. Harry walked with him to the stool, watched him place the hat upon his head. \"Slytherin!\" cried the Sorting Hat. And Severus Snape moved off to the other side of the Hall, away from Lily, to where the Slytherins were cheering him, to where Lucius Malfoy, a prefect badge gleaming upon his chest, patted Snape on the back as he sat down beside him... And the scene changed... Lily and Snape were walking across the castle courtyard, evidently arguing. Harry hurried to catch up with them, to listen in. As he reached them, he realized how much taller they both were. A few years seemed to have passed since their Sorting. \"...thought we were supposed to be friends?\" Snape was saying, \"Best friends?\" \"We are, Sev, but I don’t like some of the people you’re hanging round with! I’m sorry, but I detest Avery and Mulciber! Mulciber! What do you see in him, Sev, he’s creepy! D’you know what he tried to do to Mary Macdonald the other day?\" Lily had reached a pillar and leaned against it, looking up into the thin, sallow face. \"That was nothing,\" said Snape. \"It was a laugh, that’s all - \" \"It was Dark Magic, and if you think that’s funny - \" \"What about the stuff Potter and his mates get up to?\" demanded Snape. His color rose again as he said it, unable, it seemed, to hold in his resentment. \"What’s Potter got to do with anything?\" said Lily. \"They sneak out at night. There’s something weird about that Lupin. Where does he keep going?\" \"He’s ill,\" said Lily. \"They say he’s ill - \" \"Every month at the full moon?\" said Snape. \"I know your theory,\" said Lily, and she sounded cold. \"Why are you so obsessed with them anyway? Why do you care what they’re doing at night?\" \"I’m just trying to show you they’re not as wonderful as everyone seems to think they are.\" The intensity of his gaze made her blush. \"They don’t use Dark Magic, though.\" She dropped her voice. \"And you’re being really ungrateful. I heard what happened the other night. You went sneaking down that tunnel by the Whomping Willow, and James Potter saved you from whatever’s down there - \" Snape’s whole face contorted and he spluttered, \"Saved? Saved? You think he was playing the hero? He was saving his neck and his friends’ too! You’re not going to - I won’t let you - \" \"Let me? Let me?\" Lily’s bright green eyes were slits. Snape backtracked at once. \"I didn’t m ean - I just don’t want to see you made a fool of - He fancies you, James Potter fancies you!\" The words seemed wrenched from him against his will. \"And he’s not...everyone thinks...big Quidditch hero - \" Snape’s bitterness and dislike were rendering him incoherent, and Lily’s eyebrows were traveling farther and farther up her forehead. \"I know James Potter’s an arrogant toerag,\" she said, cutting across Snape. \"I don’t need you to tell me that. But Mulciber’s and Avery’s idea of humor is just evil. Evil, Sev. I don’t understand how you can be friends with them.\" Harry doubted that Snape had even heard her strictures on Mulciber and Avery. The moment she had insulted James Potter, his whole body had relaxed, and as they walked away there was a new spring in Snape’s step... And the scene dissolved... Harry watched again as Snape left the Great Hall after sitting his O.W.L. in Defense Against the Dark Arts, watched as he wandered away from the castle and strayed inadvertently close to the place beneath the beech tree where James, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew sat together. But Harry kept his distance this time, because he knew what happened after James had hoisted Severus into the air and taunted him; he knew what had been done and said, and it gave him no pleasure to hear it again... He watched as Lily joined the group and went to Snape’s defense. Distantly he heard Snape shout at her in his humiliation and his fury, the unforgivable word: \"Mudblood.\" The scene changed... \"I’m sorry.\" \"I’m not interested.\" \"I’m sorry!\" \"Save your breath\" It was nighttime. Lily, who was wearing a dressing gown, stood with her arms folded in front of the portrait of the Fat Lady, at the entrance to Gryffindor Tower. \"I only came out because Mary told me you were threatening to sleep here.\" \"I was. I would have done. I never meant to call you Mudblood, it just - \" \"Slipped out?\" There was no pity in Lily’s voice. \"It’s too late. I’ve made excuses for you for years. None of my friends can understand why I even talk to you. You and your precious little Death Eater friends - you see, you don’t even deny it! You don’t even deny that’s what you’re all aiming to be! You can’t wait to join You-Know-Who, can you?\" He opened his mouth, but closed it without speaking. \"I can’t pretend anymore. You’ve chosen your way, I’ve chosen mine.\" \"No - listen, I didn’t mean - \" \" - to call me Mudblood? But you call everyone of my birth Mudblood, Severus. Why should I be any different?\" He struggled on the verge of speech, but with a contemptuous look she turned and climbed back through the portrait hole... The corridor dissolved, and the scene took a little longer to reform: Harry seemed to fly through shifting shapes and colors until his surroundings solidified again and he stood on a hilltop, forlorn and cold in the darkness, the wind whistling through the branches of a few leafless trees. The adult Snape was panting, turning on the spot, his wand gripped tightly in his hand, waiting for something or for someone... His fear infected Harry too, even though he knew that he could not be harmed, and he looked over his shoulder, wondering what it was that Snape was waiting for - Then a blinding, jagged jet of white light flew through the air. Harry thought of lightning, but Snape had dropped to his knees and his wand had flown out of his hand. \"Don’t kill me!\" \"That was not my intention.\" Any sound of Dumbledore Apparating had been drowned by the sound of the wind in the branches. He stood before Snape with his robes whipping around him, and his face was illuminated from below in the light cast by his wand. \"Well, Severus? What message does Lord Voldemort have for me?\" \"No - no message - I’m here on my own account!\" Snape was wringing his hands. He looked a little mad, with his straggling black hair flying around him. \"I - I come with a warning - no, a request - please - \" Dumbledore flicked his wand. Though leaves and branches still flew through the night air around them, silence fell on the spot where he and Snape faced each other. \"What request could a Death Eater make of me?\" \"The - the prophecy...the prediction...Trelawney...\" \"Ah, yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"How much did you relay to Lord Voldemort?\" \"Everything - everything I heard!\" said Snape. \"That is why - it is for that reason - he thinks it means Lily Evans!\" \"The prophecy did not refer to a woman,\" said Dumbledore. \"It spoke of a boy born at the end of July - \" \"You know what I mean! He thinks it means her son, he is going to hunt her down - kill them all - \" \"If she means so much to you,\" said Dumbledore, \"surely Lord Voldemort will spare her? Could you not ask for mercy for the mother, in exchange for the son?\" \"I have - I have asked him - \" \"You disgust me,\" said Dumbledore, and Harry had never heard so much contempt in his voice. Snape seemed to shrink a little, \"You do not care, then, about the deaths of her husband and child? They can die, as long as you have what you want?\" Snape said nothing, but merely looked up at Dumbledore. \"Hide them all, then,\" he croaked. \"Keep her - them - safe. Please.\" \"And what will you give me in return, Severus?\" \"In - in return?\" Snape gaped at Dumbledore, and Harry expected him to protest, but after a long moment he said, \"Anything.\" The hilltop faded, and Harry stood in Dumbledore’s office, and something was making a terrible sound, like a wounded animal. Snape was slumped forward in a chair and Dumbledore was standing over him, looking grim. After a moment or two, Snape raised his face, and he looked like a man who had lived a hundred years of misery since leaving the wild hilltop. \"I thought...you were going...to keep her...safe...\" \"She and James put their faith in the wrong person,\" said Dumbledore. \"Rather like you, Severus. Weren’t you hoping that Lord Voldemort would spare her?\" Snape’s breathing was shallow. \"Her boy survives,\" said Dumbledore. With a tiny jerk of the head, Snape seemed to flick off an irksome fly. \"Her son lives. He has her eyes, precisely her eyes. You remember the shape and color of Lily Evans’s eyes, I am sure?\" \"DON’T!\" bellowed Snape. \"Gone...dead...\" \"Is this remorse, Severus?\" \"I wish...I wish I were dead...\" \"And what use would that be to anyone?\" said Dumbledore coldly. \"If you loved Lily Evans, if you truly loved her, then your way forward is clear.\" Snape seemed to peer through a haze of pain, and Dumbledore’s words appeared to take a long time to reach him. \"What - what do you mean?\" \"You know how and why she died. Make sure it was not in vain. Help me protect Lily’s son.\" \"He does not need protection. The Dark Lord has gone - \" \"The Dark Lord will return, and Harry Potter will be in terrible danger when he does.\" There was a long pause, and slowly Snape regained control of himself, mastered his own breathing. At last he said, \"Very well. Very well. But never - never tell, Dumbledore! This must be between us! Swear it! I cannot bear...especially Potter’s son...I want your word!\" \"My word, Severus, that I shall never reveal the best of you?\" Dumbledore sighed, looking down into Snape’s ferocious, anguished face. \"If you insist...\" The office dissolved but re-formed instantly. Snape was pacing up and down in front of Dumbledore. \" - mediocre, arrogant as his father, a determined rule-breaker, delighted to find himself famous, attention-seeking and impertinent - \" \"You see what you expect to see, Severus,\" said Dumbledore, without raising his eyes from a copy of Transfiguration Today. \"Other teachers report that the boy is modest, likable, and reasonably talented. Personally, I find him an engaging child.\" Dumbledore turned a page, and said, without looking up, \"Keep an eye on Quirrell, won’t you?\" A whirl of color, and now everything darkened, and Snape and Dumbledore stood a little apart in the entrance hall, while the last stragglers from the Yule Ball passed them on their way to bed. \"Well?\" murmured Dumbledore. \"Karkaroff’s Mark is becoming darker too. He is panicking, he fears retribution; you know how much help he gave the Ministry after the Dark Lord fell.\" Snape looked sideways at Dumbledore’s crooked-nosed profile. \"Karkaroff intends to flee if the Mark burns.\" \"Does he?\" said Dumbledore softly, as Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies came giggling in from the grounds. \"And are you tempted to join him?\" \"No,\" said Snape, his black eyes on Fleur’s and Roger’s retreating figures. \"I am not such a coward.\" \"No,\" agreed Dumbledore. \"You are a braver man by far than Igor Karkaroff. You know, I sometimes think we Sort too soon...\" He walked away, leaving Snape looking stricken... And now Harry stood in the headmaster’s office yet again. It was nighttime, and Dumbledore sagged sideways in the thronelike chair behind the desk, apparently semiconscious. His right hand dangled over the side, blackened and burned. Snape was muttering incantations, pointing his wand at the wrist of the hand, while with his left hand he tipped a goblet full of thick golden potion down Dumbledore’s throat. After a moment or two, Dumbledore’s eyelids fluttered and opened. \"Why,\" said Snape, without preamble, \"why did you put on that ring? It carries a curse, surely you realized that. Why even touch it?\" Marvolo Gaunt’s ring lay on the desk before Dumbledore. It was cracked; the sword of Gryffindor lay beside it. Dumbledore grimaced. \"I...was a fool. Sorely tempted...\" \"Tempted by what?\" Dumbledore did not answer. \"It is a miracle you managed to return here!\" Snape sounded furious. \"That ring carried a curse of extraordinary power, to contain it is all we can hope for; I have trapped the curse in one hand for the time being - \" Dumbledore raised his blackened, useless hand, and examined it with the expression of one being shown an interesting curio. \"You have done very well, Severus. How long do you think I have?\" Dumbledore’s tone was conversational; he might have been asking for a weather forecast. Snape hesitated, and then said, \"I cannot tell. Maybe a year. There is no halting such a spell forever. It will spread eventually, it is the sort of curse that strengthens over time.\" Dumbledore smiled. The news that he had less than a year to live seemed a matter of little or no concern to him. \"I am fortunate, extremely fortunate, that I have you, Severus.\" \"If you had only summoned me a little earlier, I might have been able to do more, buy you more time!\" said Snape furiously. He looked down at the broken ring and the sword. \"Did you think that breaking the ring would break the curse?\" \"Something like that...I was delirious, no doubt...\" said Dumbledore. With an effort he straightened himself in his chair. \"Well, really, this makes matters much more straightforward.\" Snape looked utterly perplexed. Dumbledore smiled. \"I refer to the plan Lord Voldemort is revolving around me. His plan to have the poor Malfoy boy murder me.\" Snape sat down in the chair Harry had so often occupied, across the desk from Dumbledore. Harry could tell that he wanted to say more on the subject of Dumbledore’s cursed hand, but the other held it up in polite refusal to discuss the matter further. Scowling, Snape said, \"The Dark Lord does not expect Draco to succeed. This is merely punishment for Lucius’s recent failures. Slow torture for Draco’s parents, while they watch him fail and pay the price.\" \"In short, the boy has had a death sentence pronounced upon him as surely as I have,\" said Dumbledore. \"Now, I should have thought the natural successor to the job, once Draco fails, is yourself?\" There was a short pause. \"That, I think, is the Dark Lord’s plan.\" \"Lord Voldemort foresees a moment in the near future when he will not need a spy at Hogwarts?\" \"He believes the school will soon be in his grasp, yes.\" \"And if it does fall into his grasp,\" said Dumbledore, almost, it seemed, as an aside, \"I have your word that you will do all in your power to protect the students at Hogwarts?\" Snape gave a stiff nod. \"Good. Now then. Your first priority will be to discover what Draco is up to. A frightened teenage boy is a danger to others as well as to himself. Offer him help and guidance, he ought to accept, he likes you - \" \" - much less since his father has lost favor. Draco blames me, he thinks I have usurped Lucius’s position.\" \"All the same, try. I am concerned less for myself than for accidental victims of whatever schemes might occur to the boy. Ultimately, of course, there is only one thing to be done if we are to save him from Lord Voldemort’s wrath.\" Snape raised his eyebrows and his tone was sardonic as he asked, \"Are you intending to let him kill you?\" \"Certainly not. You must kill me.\" There was a long silence, broken only by an odd clicking noise. Fawkes the phoenix was gnawing a bit of cuttlebone. \"Would you like me to do it now?\" asked Snape, his voice heavy with irony. \"Or would you like a few moments to compose an epitaph?\" \"Oh, not quite yet,\" said Dumbledore, smiling. \"I daresay the moment will present itself in due course. Given what has happened tonight,\" he indicated his withered hand, \"we can be sure that it will happen within a year.\" \"If you don’t mind dying,\" said Snape roughly, \"why not let Draco do it?\" \"That boy’s soul is not yet so damaged,\" said Dumbledore. \"I would not have it ripped apart on my account.\" \"And my soul, Dumbledore? Mine?\" \"You alone know whether it will harm your soul to help an old man avoid pain and humiliation,\" said Dumbledore. \"I ask this one great favor of you, Severus, because death is coming for me as surely as the Chudley Cannons will finish bottom of this year’s league. I confess I should prefer a quick, painless exit to the protracted and messy affair it will be if, for instance, Greyback is involved - I hear Voldemort has recruited him? Or dear Bellatrix, who likes to play with her food before she eats it.\" His tone was light, but his blue eyes pierced Snape as they had frequently pierced Harry, as though the soul they discussed was visible to him. At last Snape gave another curt nod. Dumbledore seemed satisfied. \"Thank you, Severus...\" The office disappeared, and now Snape and Dumbledore were strolling together in the deserted castle grounds by twilight. \"What are you doing with Potter, all these evenings you are closeted together?\" Snape asked abruptly. Dumbledore looked weary. \"Why? You aren’t trying to give him more detentions, Severus? The boy will soon have spent more time in detention than out.\" \"He is his father over again - \" \"In looks, perhaps, but his deepest nature is much more like his mother’s. I spend time with Harry because I have things to discuss with him, information I must give him before it is too late.\" \"Information,\" repeated Snape. \"You trust him...you do not trust me.\" \"It is not a question of trust. I have, as we both know, limited time. It is essential that I give the boy enough information for him to do what he needs to do.\" \"And why may I not have the same information?\" \"I prefer not to put all of my secrets in one basket, particularly not a basket that spends so much time dangling on the arm of Lord Voldemort.\" \"Which I do on your orders!\" \"And you do it extremely well. Do not think that I underestimate the constant danger in which you place yourself, Severus. To give Voldemort what appears to be valuable information while withholding the essentials is a job I would entrust to nobody but you.\" \"Yet you confide much more in a boy who is incapable of Occlumency, whose magic is mediocre, and who has a direct connection into the Dark Lord’s mind!\" \"Voldemort fears that connection,\" said Dumbledore. \"Not so long ago he had one small taste of what truly sharing Harry’s mind means to him. It was pain such as he has never experienced. He will not try to possess Harry again, I am sure of it. Not in that way.\" \"I don’t understand.\" \"Lord Voldemort’s soul, maimed as it is, cannot bear close contact with a soul like Harry’s. Like a tongue on frozen steel, like flesh in flame - \" \"Souls? We were talking of minds!\" \"In the case of Harry and Lord Voldemort, to speak of one is to speak of the other.\" Dumbledore glanced around to make sure that they were alone. They were close by the Forbidden Forest now, but there was no sign of anyone near them. \"After you have killed me, Severus - \" \"You refuse to tell me everything, yet you expect that small service of me!\" snarled Snape, and real anger flared in the thin face now. \"You take a great deal for granted, Dumbledore! Perhaps I have changed my mind!\" \"You gave me your word, Severus. And while we are talking about services you owe me, I thought you agreed to keep a close eye on our young Slytherin friend?\" Snape looked angry, mutinous. Dumbledore sighed. \"Come to my office tonight, Severus, at eleven, and you shall not complain that I have no confidence in you...\" They were back in Dumbledore’s office, the windows dark, and Fawkes sat silent as Snape sat quite still, as Dumbledore walked around him, talking. \"Harry must not know, not until the last moment, not until it is necessary, otherwise how could he have the strength to do what must be done?\" \"But what must he do?\" \"That is between Harry and me. Now listen closely, Severus. There will come a time - after my death - do not argue, do not interrupt! There will come a time when Lord Voldemort will seem to fear for the life of his snake.\" \"For Nagini?\" Snape looked astonished. \"Precisely. If there comes a time when Lord Voldemort stops sending that snake forth to do his bidding, but keeps it safe beside him under magical protection, then, I think, it will be safe to tell Harry.\" \"Tell him what?\" Dumbledore took a deep breath and closed his eyes. \"Tell him that on the night Lord Voldemort tried to kill him, when Lily cast her own life between them as a shield, the Killing Curse rebounded upon Lord Voldemort, and a fragment of Voldemort’s soul was blasted apart from the whole, and latched itself onto the only living soul left in that collapsed building. Part of Lord Voldemort lives inside Harry, and it is that which gives him the power of speech with snakes, and a connection with Lord Voldemort’s mind that he has never understood. And while that fragment of soul, unmissed by Voldemort, remains attached to and protected by Harry, Lord Voldemort cannot die.\" Harry seemed to be watching the two men from one end of a long tunnel, they were so far away from him, their voices echoing strangely in his ears. \"So the boy...the boy must die?\" asked Snape quite calmly. \"And Voldemort himself must do it, Severus. That is essential.\" Another long silence. Then Snape said, \"I thought...all those years...that we were protecting him for her. For Lily.\" \"We have protected him because it has been essential to teach him, to raise him, to let him try his strength,\" said Dumbledore, his eyes still tight shut. \"Meanwhile, the connection between them grows ever stronger, a parasitic growth. Sometimes I have thought he suspects it himself. If I know him, he will have arranged matters so that when he does set out to meet his death, it will truly mean the end of Voldemort.\" Dumbledore opened his eyes. Snape looked horrified. \"You have kept him alive so that he can die at the right moment?\" \"Don’t be shocked, Severus. How many men and women have you watched die?\" \"Lately, only those whom I could not save,\" said Snape. He stood up. \"You have used me.\" \"Meaning?\" \"I have spied for you and lied for you, put myself in mortal danger for you. Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily Potter’s son safe. Now you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for slaughter - \" \"But this is touching, Severus,\" said Dumbledore seriously. \"Have you grown to care for the boy, after all?\" \"For him?\" shouted Snape. \"Expecto Patronum!\" From the tip of his wand burst the silver doe. She landed on the office floor, bounded once across the office, and soared out of the window. Dumbledore watched her fly away, and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to Snape, and his eyes were full of tears. \"After all this time?\" \"Always,\" said Snape. And the scene shifted. Now, Harry saw Snape talking to the portrait of Dumbledore behind his desk. \"You will have to give Voldemort the correct date of Harry’s departure from his aunt and uncle’s,\" said Dumbledore. \"Not to do so will raise suspicion, when Voldemort believes you so well informed. However, you must plant the idea of decoys; that, I think, ought to ensure Harry’s safety. Try Confunding Mundungus Fletcher. And Severus, if you are forced to take part in the chase, be sure to act your part convincingly...I am counting upon you to remain in Lord Voldemort’s good books as long as possible, or Hogwarts will be left to the mercy of the Carrows...\" Now Snape was head to head with Mundungus in an unfamiliar tavern, Mundungus’s face looking curiously blank, Snape frowning in concentration. \"You will suggest to the Order of the Phoenix,\" Snape murmured, \"that they use decoys. Polyjuice Potion. Identical Potters. It’s the only thing that might work. You will forget that I have suggested this. You will present it as your own idea. You understand?\" \"I understand,\" murmured Mundungus, his eyes unfocused... Now Harry was flying alongside Snape on a broomstick through a clear dark night: He was accompanied by other hodded Death Eaters, and ahead were Lupin and a Harry who was really George... A Death Eater moved ahead of Snape and raised his wand, pointing it directly at Lupin’s back. \"Sectumsempra!\" shouted Snape. But the spell, intended for the Death Eater’s wand hand, missed and hit George instead - And next, Snape was kneeling in Sirius’s old bedroom. Tears were dripping from the end of his hooked nose as he read the old letter from Lily. The second page carried only a few words: could ever have been friends with Gellert Grindelwald. I think her mind’s going, personally! Lots of love, Lily Snape took the page bearing Lily’s signature, and her love, and tucked it inside his robes. Then he ripped in two the photograph he was also holding, so that he kept the part from which Lily laughed, throwing the portion showing James and Harry back onto the floor, under the chest of drawers... And now Snape stood again in the headmaster’s study as Phineas Nigellus came hurrying into his portrait. \"Headmaster! They are camping in the Forest of Dean! The Mudblood - \" \"Do not use that word!\" \" - the Granger girl, then, mentioned the place as she opened her bag and I heard her!\" \"Good. Very good!\" cried the portrait of Dumbledore behind the headmaster’s chair. \"Now, Severus, the sword! Do not forget that it must be taken under conditions of need and valor - and he must not know that you give it! If Voldemort should read Harry’s mind and see you acting for him - \" \"I know,\" said Snape curtly. He approached the portrait of Dumbledore and pulled at its side. It swung forward, revealing a hidden cavity behind it from which he took the sword of Gryffindor. \"And you still aren’t going to tell me why it’s so important to give Potter the sword?\" said Snape as he swung a traveling cloak over his robes. \"No, I don’t think so,\" said Dumbledore’s portrait. \"He will know what to do with it. And Severus, be very careful, they may not take kindly to your appearance after George Weasley’s mishap - \" Snape turned at the door. \"Don’t worry, Dumbledore,\" he said coolly. \"I have a plan...\" And Snape left the room. Harry rose up out of the Pensieve, and moments later he lay on the carpeted floor in exactly the same rooms Snape might just have closed the door. \n",

            " In Memorandum Harry was bleeding. Clutching his right hand in his left and swearing under his breath, he shouldered open his bedroom door. There was a crunch of breaking china. He had trodden on a cup of cold tea that had been sitting on the floor outside his bedroom door. \"What the --?\" He looked around, the landing of number four, Privet Drive, was deserted. Possibly the cup of tea was Dudley's idea of a clever booby trap. Keeping his bleeding hand elevated, Harry scraped the fragments of cup together with the other hand and threw them into the already crammed bin just visible inside his bedroom door. Then he tramped across to the bathroom to run his finger under the tap. It was stupid, pointless, irritating beyond belief that he still had four days left of being unable to perform magic...but he had to admit to himself that this jagged cut in his finger would have defeated him. He had never learned how to repair wounds, and now he came to think of it - particularly in light of his immediate plans - this seemed a serious flaw in his magical education. Making a mental note to ask Hermione how it was done, he used a large wad of toilet paper to mop up as much of the tea as he could before returning to his bedroom and slamming the door behind him. Harry had spent the morning completely emptying his school trunk for the first time since he had packed it six years ago. At the start of the intervening school years, he had merely skimmed off the topmost three quarters of the contents and replaced or updated them, leaving a layer of general debris at the bottom - old quills, desiccated beetle eyes, single socks that no longer fit. Minutes previously, Harry had plunged his hand into this mulch, experienced a stabbing pain in the fourth finger of his right hand, and withdrawn it to see a lot of blood. He now proceeded a little more cautiously. Kneeling down beside the trunk again, he groped around in the bottom and, after retrieving an old badge that flickered feebly between SUPPORT CEDRIC DIGGORY and POTTER STINKS, a cracked and worn-out Sneakoscope, and a gold locket inside which a note signed R.A.B. had been hidden, he finally discovered the sharp edge that had done the damage. He recognized it at once. It was a two-inch-long fragment of the enchanted mirror that his dead godfather, Sirius, had given him. Harry laid it aside and felt cautiously around the trunk for the rest, but nothing more remained of his godfather's last gift except powdered glass, which clung to the deepest layer of debris like glittering grit. Harry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which he had cut himself, seeing nothing but his own bright green eye reflected back at him. Then he placed the fragment on top of that morning's Daily prophet, which lay unread on the bed, and attempted to stem the sudden upsurge of bitter memories, the stabs of regret and of longing the discovery of the broken mirror had occasioned, by attacking the rest of the rubbish in the trunk. It took another hour to empty it completely, throw away the useless items, and sort the remainder in piles according to whether or not he would need them from now on. His school and Quidditch robes, cauldron, parchment, quills, and most of his textbooks were piled in a corner, to be left behind. He wondered what his aunt and uncle would do with them; burn them in the dead of night, probably, as if they were evidence of some dreadful crime. His Muggle clothing, Invisibility Cloak, potion-making kit, certain books, the photograph album Hagrid had once given him, a stack of letters, and his wand had been repacked into an old rucksack. In a front pocket were the Marauder's Map and the locket with the note signed R.A.B. inside it. The locket was accorded this place of honor not because it was valuable - in all usual senses it was worthless - but because of what it had cost to attain it. This left a sizable stack of newspapers sitting on his desk beside his snowy owl, Hedwig: one for each of the days Harry had spent at Privet Drive this summer. He got up off the floor, stretched, and moved across to his desk. Hedwig made no movement as he began to flick through newspapers, throwing them into the rubbish pile one by one. The owl was asleep or else faking; she was angry with Harry about the limited amount of time she was allowed out of her cage at the moment. As he neared the bottom of the pile of newspapers, Harry slowed down, searching for one particular issue that he knew had arrived shortly after he had returned to Privet Drive for the summer; he remembered that there had been a small mention on the front about the resignation of Charity Burbage, the Muggle Studies teacher at Hogwarts. At last he found it. Turning to page ten, he sank into his desk chair and reread the article he had been looking for. ALBUS DUMBLEDORE REMEMBERED By Elphias Doge I met Albus Dumbledore at the age of eleven, on our first day at Hogwarts. Our mutual attraction was undoubtedly due to the fact that we both felt ourselves to be outsiders. I had contracted dragon pox shortly before arriving at school, and while I was no longer contagious, my pock-marked visage and greenish hue did not encourage many to approach me. For his part, Albus had arrived at Hogwarts under the burden of unwanted notoriety. Scarcely a year previously, his father, Percival, had been convicted of a savage and well-publicized attack upon three young Muggles. Albus never attempted to deny that his father (who was to die in Azkaban) had committed this crime; on the contrary, when I plucked up courage to ask him, he assured me that he knew his father to be guilty. Beyond that, Dumbledore refused to speak of the sad business, though many attempted to make him do so. Some, indeed, were disposed to praise his father's action and assumed that Albus too was a Muggle-hater. They could not have been more mistaken: As anybody who knew Albus would attest, he never revealed the remotest anti-Muggle tendency. Indeed, his determined support for Muggle rights gained him many enemies in subsequent years. In a matter of months, however, Albus's own fame had begun to eclipse that of his father. By the end of his first year he would never again be known as the son of a Muggle-hater, but as nothing more or less than the most brilliant student ever seen at the school. Those of us who were privileged to be his friends benefited from his example, not to mention his help and encouragement, with which he was always generous. He confessed to me later in life that he knew even then that his greatest pleasure lay in teaching. He not only won every prize of note that the school offered, he was soon in regular correspondence with the most notable magical names of the day, including Nicolas Flamel, the celebrated alchemist; Bathilda Bagshot, the noted historian; and Adalbert Waffling, the magical theoretician. Several of his papers found their way into learned publications such as Transfiguration Today, Challenges in Charming, and The Practical Potioneer. Dumbledore's future career seemed likely to be meteoric, and the only question that remained was when he would become Minister of Magic. Though it was often predicted in later years that he was on the point of taking the job, however, he never had Ministerial ambitions. Three years after we had started at Hogwarts, Albus's brother, Aberforth, arrived at school. They were not alike: Aberforth was never bookish and, unlike Albus, preferred to settle arguments by dueling rather than through reasoned discussion. However, it is quite wrong to suggest, as some have, that the brothers were not friends. They rubbed along as comfortably as two such different boys could do. In fairness to Aberforth, it must be admitted that living in Albus's shadow cannot have been an altogether comfortable experience. Being continually outshone was an occupational hazard of being his friend and cannot have been any more pleasurable as a brother. When Albus and I left Hogwarts we intended to take the then-traditional tour of the world together, visiting and observing foreign wizards, before pursuing our separate careers. However, tragedy intervened. On the very eve of our trip, Albus's mother, Kendra, died, leaving Albus the head, and sole breadwinner, of the family. I postponed my departure long enough to pay my respects at Kendra's funeral, then left for what was now to be a solitary journey. With a younger brother and sister to care for, and little gold left to them, there could no longer be any question of Albus accompanying me. That was the period of our lives when we had least contact. I wrote to Albus, describing, perhaps insensitively, the wonders of my journey, from narrow escapes from chimaeras in Greece to the experiments of the Egyptian alchemists. His letters told me little of his day-to-day life, which I guessed to be frustratingly dull for such a brilliant wizard. Immersed in my own experiences, it was with horror that I heard, toward the end of my year's travels, that another tragedy had struck the Dumbledores: the death of his sister, Ariana. Though Ariana had been in poor health for a long time, the blow, coming so soon after the loss of their mother, had a profound effect on both of her brothers. All those closest to Albus - and I count myself one of that lucky number - agree that Ariana's death, and Albus's feeling of personal responsibility for it (though, of course, he was guiltless), left their mark upon him forevermore. I returned home to find a young man who had experienced a much older person's suffering. Albus was more reserved than before, and much less light-hearted. To add to his misery, the loss of Ariana had led, not to a renewed closeness between Albus and Aberforth, but to an estrangement. (In time this would lift - in later years they reestablished, if not a close relationship, then certainly a cordial one.) However, he rarely spoke of his parents or of Ariana from then on, and his friends learned not to mention them. Other quills will describe the triumphs of the following years. Dumbledore's innumerable contributions to the store of Wizarding knowledge, including his discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, will benefit generations to come, as will the wisdom he displayed in the many judgments while Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot. They say, still, that no Wizarding duel ever matched that between Dumbledore and Grindelwald in 1945. Those who witnessed it have written of the terror and the awe they felt as they watched these two extraordinary wizards to battle. Dumbledore's triumph, and its consequences for the Wizarding world, are considered a turning point in magical history to match the introduction of the International Statute of Secrecy or the downfall of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Albus Dumbledore was never proud or vain; he could find something to value in anyone, however apparently insignificant or wretched, and I believe that his early losses endowed him with great humanity and sympathy. I shall miss his friendship more than I can say, but my loss is nothing compared to the Wizarding world's. That he was the most inspiring and best loved of all Hogwarts headmasters cannot be in question. He died as he lived: working always for the greater good and, to his last hour, as willing to stretch out a hand to a small boy with dragon pox as he was on the day I met him. Harry finished reading, but continued to gaze at the picture accompanying the obituary. Dumbledore was wearing his familiar, kindly smile, but as he peered over the top of his half-moon spectacles, he gave the impression, even in newsprint, of X-raying Harry, whose sadness mingled with a sense of humiliation. He had thought he knew Dumbledore quite well, but ever since reading this obituary he had been forced to recognize that he had barely known him at all. Never once had he imagined Dumbledore's childhood or youth; it was as though he had sprung into being as Harry had known him, venerable and silver-haired and old. The idea of a teenage Dumbledore was simply odd, like trying to imagine a stupid Hermione or a friendly Blast-Ended Skrewt. He had never thought to ask Dumbledore about his past. No doubt it would have felt strange, impertinent even, but after all it had been common knowledge that Dumbledore had taken part in that legendary duel with Grindelwald, and Harry had not thought to ask Dumbledore what that had been like, nor about any of his other famous achievements. No, they had always discussed Harry, Harry's past, Harry's future, Harry's plans... and it seemed to Harry now, despite the fact that his future was so dangerous and so uncertain, that he had missed irreplaceable opportunities when he had failed to ask Dumbledore more about himself, even though the only personal question he had ever asked his headmaster was also the only one he suspected that Dumbledore had not answered honestly: \"What do you see when you look in the mirror?\" \"I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.\" After several minutes' thought, Harry tore the obituary out of the Prophet, folded it carefully, and tucked it inside the first volume of Practical Defensive Magic and its Use against the Dark Arts. Then he threw the rest of the newspaper onto the rubbish pile and turned to face the room. It was much tidier. The only things left out of place were today's Daily Prophet, still lying on the bed, and on top of it, the piece of broken mirror. Harry moved across the room, slid the mirror fragment off today's Prophet, and unfolded the newspaper. He had merely glanced at the headline when he had taken the rolled-up paper from the delivery owl early that morning and thrown it aside, after noting that it said nothing about Voldemort. Harry was sure that the Ministry was leaning on the Prophet to suppress news about Voldemort. It was only now, therefore, that he saw what he had missed. Across the bottom half of the front page a smaller headline was set over a picture of Dumbledore striding along, looking harried: DUMBLEDORE - THE TRUTH AT LAST? Coming next week, the shocking story of the flawed genius considered by many to be the greatest wizard of his generation. Striping away the popular image of serene, silver-bearded wisdom, Rita Skeeter reveals the disturbed childhood, the lawless youth, the life-long feuds, and the guilty secrets that Dumbledore carried to his grave, WHY was the man tipped to be the Minister of Magic content to remain a mere headmaster? WHAT was the real purpose of the secret organization known as the Order of the Phoenix? HOW did Dumbledore really meet his end? The answers to these and many more questions are explored in the explosive new biography, The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, by Rita Skeeter, exclusively interviewed by Berry Braithwaite, page 13, inside. Harry ripped open the paper and found page thirteen. The article was topped with a picture showing another familiar face: a woman wearing jeweled glasses with elaborately curled blonde hair, her teeth bared in what was clearly supposed to be a winning smile, wiggling her fingers up at him. Doing his best to ignore this nauseating image, Harry read on. In person, Rita Skeeter is much warmer and softer than her famously ferocious quill-portraits might suggest. Greeting me in the hallway of her cozy home, she leads me straight into the kitchen for a cup of tea, a slice of pound cake and, it goes without saying, a steaming vat of freshest gossip. \"Well, of course, Dumbledore is a biographer's dream,\" says Skeeter. \"Such a long, full life. I'm sure my book will be the first of very, very many.\" Skeeter was certainly quick off the mark. Her nine-hundred-page book was completed in a mere four weeks after Dumbledore's mysterious death in June. I ask her how she managed this superfast feat. \"Oh, when you've been a journalist as long as I have, working to a deadline is second nature. I knew that the Wizarding world was clamoring for the full story and I wanted to be the first to meet that need.\" I mention the recent, widely publicized remarks of Elphias Doge, Special Advisor to the Wizengamot and longstanding friend of Albus Dumbledore's, that \"Skeeter's book contains less fact than a Chocolate Frog card.\" Skeeter throws back her head and laughs. \"Darling Dodgy! I remember interviewing him a few years back about merpeople rights, bless him. Completely gaga, seemed to think we were sitting at the bottom of Lake Windermere, kept telling me to watch out for trout.\" And yet Elphias Doge's accusations of inaccuracy have been echoed in many places. Does Skeeter really feel that four short weeks have been enough to gain a full picture of Dumbledore's long and extraordinary life? \"Oh, my dear,\" beams Skeeter, rapping me affectionately across the knuckles, \"you know as well as I do how much information can be generated by a fat bag of Galleons, a refusal to hear the word 'no,' and a nice sharp Quick-Quotes Quill! People were queuing to dish the dirt on Dumbledore anyway. Not everyone thought he was so wonderful, you know - he trod on an awful lot of important toes. But old Dodgy Doge can get off his high hippogriff, because I've had access to a source most journalists would swap their wands for, one who has never spoken in public before and who was close to Dumbledore during the most turbulent and disturbing phase of his youth.\" The advance publicity for Skeeter's biography has certainly suggested that there will be shocks in store for those who believe Dumbledore to have led a blameless life. What were the biggest surprises she uncovered, I ask? \"Now, come off it. Betty, I'm not giving away all the highlights before anybody's bought the book!\" laughs Skeeter. \"But I can promise that anybody who still thinks Dumbledore was white as his beard is in for a rude awakening! Let's just say that nobody hearing him rage against You-Know-Who would have dreamed that he dabbled in the Dark Arts himself in his youth! And for a wizard who spent his later years pleading for tolerance, he wasn't exactly broad-minded when he was younger! Yes, Albus Dumbledore had an extremely murky past, not to mention that very fishy family, which he worked so hard to keep hushed up.\" I ask whether Skeeter is referring to Dumbledore's brother, Aberforth, whose conviction by the Wizengamot for misuse of magic caused a minor scandal fifteen years ago. \"Oh, Aberforth is just the tip of the dung heap,\" laughs Skeeter. \"No, no, I'm talking about much worse than a brother with a fondness for fiddling about with goats, worse even than the Muggle-maiming father - Dumbledore couldn't keep either of them quiet anyway, they were both charged by the Wizengamot. No, it's the mother and the sister that intrigued me, and a little digging uncovered a positive nest of nastiness - but, as I say, you'll have to wait for chapters nine to twelve for full details. All I can say now is, it's no wonder Dumbledore never talked about how his nose got broken.\" Family skeletons notwithstanding, does Skeeter deny the brilliance that led to Dumbledore's many magical discoveries? \"He had brains,\" she concedes, \"although many now question whether he could really take full credit for all of his supposed achievements. As I reveal in chapter sixteen, Ivor Dillonsby claims he had already discovered eight uses of dragon's blood when Dumbledore 'borrowed' his papers.\" But the importance of some of Dumbledore's achievements cannot, I venture, be denied. What of his famous defeat of Grindelwald? \"Oh, now, I'm glad you mentioned Grindelwald,\" says Skeeter with such a tantalizing smile. \"I'm afraid those who go dewy-eyed over Dumbledore's spectacular victory must brace themselves for a bombshell - or perhaps a Dungbomb. Very dirty business indeed. All I'll say is, don't be so sure that there really was a spectacular duel of legend. After they've read my book, people may be forced to conclude that Grindelwald simply conjured a white handkerchief from the end of his wand and came quietly!\" Skeeter refuses to give any more away on this intriguing subject, so we turn instead to the relationship that will undoubtedly fascinate her readers more than any other. \"Oh yes,\" says Skeeter, nodding briskly, \"I devote an entire chapter to the whole Potter-Dumbledore relationship. It's been called unhealthy, even sinister. Again, your readers will have to buy my book for the whole story, but there is no question that Dumbledore took an unnatural interest in Potter from the word go. Whether that was really in the boy's best interests - well, we'll see. It's certainly an open secret that Potter has had a most troubled adolescence.\" I ask whether Skeeter is still in touch with Harry Potter, whom she so famously interviewed last year: a breakthrough piece in which Potter spoke exclusively of his conviction that You-Know-Who had returned. \"Oh, yes, we've developed a closer bond,\" says Skeeter. \"Poor Potter has few real friends, and we met at one of the most testing moments of his life - the Triwizard Tournament. I am probably one of the only people alive who can say that they know the real Harry Potter.\" Which leads us neatly to the many rumors still circulating about Dumbledore's final hours. Does Skeeter believe that Potter was there when Dumbledore died? \"Well, I don't want to say too much - it's all in the book - but eyewitnesses inside Hogwarts castle saw Potter running away from the scene moments after Dumbledore fell, jumped, or was pushed. Potter later gave evidence against Severus Snape, a man against whom he has a notorious grudge. Is everything as it seems? That is for the Wizarding community to decide - once they've read my book.\" On that intriguing note, I take my leave. There can be no doubt that Skeeter has quilled an instant bestseller. Dumbledore's legion of admirers, meanwhile, may well be trembling at what is soon to emerge about their hero. Harry reached the bottom of the article, but continued to stare blankly at the page. Revulsion and fury rose in him like vomit; he balled up the newspaper and threw it, with all his force, at the wall, where it joined the rest of the rubbish heaped around his overflowing bin. He began to stride blindly around the room, opening empty drawers and picking up books only to replace them on the same piles, barely conscious of what he was doing, as random phrases from Rita's article echoed in his head: An entire chapter to the whole Potter-Dumbledore relationship ... It's been called unhealthy, even sinister ... He dabbled in the Dark Arts himself in his youth ... I've had access to a source most journalists would swap their wands for... \"Lies!\" Harry bellowed, and through the window he saw the next-door neighbor, who had paused to restart his lawn mower, look up nervously. Harry sat down hard on the bed. The broken bit of mirror danced away from him; he picked it up and turned it over in his fingers, thinking, thinking of Dumbledore and the lies with which Rita Skeeter was defaming him ... A flash of brightest blue. Harry froze, his cut finger slipping on the jagged edge of the mirror again. He had imagined it, he must have done. He glanced over his shoulder, but the wall was a sickly peach color of Aunt Petunia's choosing: There was nothing blue there for the mirror to reflect. He peered into the mirror fragment again, and saw nothing but his own bright green eye looking back at him. He had imagined it, there was no other explanation; imagined it, because he had been thinking of his dead headmaster. If anything was certain, it was that the bright blue eyes of Albus Dumbledore would never pierce him again. \n",

            " NINETEEN THE SERVANT OF LORD VOLDEMORT Hermione screamed. Black leapt to his feet. Harry felt as though he'd received a huge electric shock. \"I found this at the base of the Whomping Willow,\" said Snape, throwing the cloak aside, careful to keep this wand pointing directly at Lupin's chest. \"Very useful, Potter, I thank you....\" Snape was slightly breathless, but his face was full of suppressed triumph. \"You're wondering, perhaps, how I knew you were here?\" he said, his eyes glittering. \"I've just been to your office, Lupin. You forgot to take your potion tonight, so I took a gobletful along. And very lucky I did... lucky for me, I mean. Lying on your desk was a certain map. One glance at it told me all I needed to know. I saw you running along this passageway and out of sight.\" \"Severus --\" Lupin began, but Snape overrode him. \"I've told the headmaster again and again that you're helping your old friend Black into the castle, Lupin, and here's the proof. Not even I dreamed you would have the nerve to use this old place as your hideout --\" \"Severus, you're making a mistake,\" said Lupin urgently. \"You haven't heard everything -- I can explain -- Sirius is not here to kill Harry --\" \"Two more for Azkaban tonight,\" said Snape, his eyes now gleaming fanatically. \"I shall be interested to see how Dumbledore takes this.... He was quite convinced you were harmless, you know, Lupin... a tame werewolf --\" \"You fool,\" said Lupin softly. \"Is a schoolboy grudge worth putting an innocent man back inside Azkaban?\" BANG! Thin, snakelike cords burst from the end of Snape's wand and twisted themselves around Lupin's mouth, wrists, and ankles; he overbalanced and fell to the floor, unable to move. With a roar of rage, Black started toward Snape, but Snape pointed his wand straight between Black's eyes. \"Give me a reason,\" he whispered. \"Give me a reason to do it, and I swear I will.\" Black stopped dead. It would have been impossible to say which face showed more hatred. Harry stood there, paralyzed, not knowing what to do or whom to believe. He glanced around at Ron and Hermione. Ron looked just as confused as he did, still fighting to keep hold on the struggling Scabbers. Hermione, however, took an uncertain step toward Snape and said, in a very breathless voice, \"Professor Snape -- it it wouldn't hurt to hear what they've got to say, w -- would it?\" \"Miss Granger, you are already facing suspension from this school,\" Snape spat. \"You, Potter, and Weasley are out-of-bounds, in the company of a convicted murderer and a werewolf. For once in your life, hold your tongue.\" \"But if -- if there was a mistake --\" \"KEEP QUIET, YOU STUPID GIRL!\" Snape shouted, looking suddenly quite deranged. \"DON'T TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!\" A few sparks shot out of the end of his wand, which was still pointed at Black's face. Hermione fell silent. \"Vengeance is very sweet,\" Snape breathed at Black. \"How I hoped I would be the one to catch you....\" \"The joke's on you again, Severus,\" Black snarled. \"As long as this boy brings his rat up to the castle\" -- he jerked his head at Ron -- \"I'll come quietly....\" \"Up to the castle?\" said Snape silkily. \"I don't think we need to go that far. All I have to do is call the dementors once we get out of the Willow. They'll be very pleased to see you, Black... pleased enough to give you a little kiss, I daresay... I --\" What little color there was in Blacks face left it. \"You -you've got to hear me out,\" he croaked. \"The rat -- look at the rat --\" But there was a mad glint in Snape's eyes that Harry had never seen before. He seemed beyond reason. \"Come on, all of you,\" he said. He clicked his fingers, and the ends of the cords that bound Lupin flew to his hands. \"I'll drag the werewolf. Perhaps the dementors will have a kiss for him too --\" Before he knew what he was doing, Harry had crossed the room in three strides and blocked the door. \"Get out of the way, Potter, you're in enough trouble already,\" snarled Snape. \"If I hadn't been here to save your skin --\" \"Professor Lupin could have killed me about a hundred times this year,\" Harry said. \"I've been alone with him loads of times, having defense lessons against the dementors. If he was helping Black, why didn't he just finish me off then?\" \"Don't ask me to fathom the way a werewolf's mind works,\" hissed Snape. \"Get out of the way, Potter.\" \"YOURE PATHETIC!\" Harry yelled. \"JUST BECAUSE THEY MADE A FOOL OF YOU AT SCHOOL YOU WON'T EVEN LISTEN --\" \"SILENCE! I WILL NOT BE SPOKEN TO LIKE THAT!\" Snape shrieked, looking madder than ever. \"Like father, like son, Potter! I have just saved your neck; you should be thanking me on bended knee! You would have been well served if he'd killed you! You'd have died like your father, too arrogant to believe you might be mistaken in Black -- now get out of the way, or I will make you. GET OUT OF THE WAY, POTTER!\" Harry made up his mind in a split second. Before Snape could take even one step toward him, he had raised his wand. \"Expelliarmus!\" he yelled -- except that his wasn't the only voice that shouted. There was a blast that made the door rattle on its hinges; Snape was lifted off his feet and slammed into the wall, then slid down it to the floor, a trickle of blood oozing from under his hair. He had been knocked out. Harry looked around. Both Ron and Hermione had tried to disarm Snape at exactly the same moment. Snape's wand soared in a high arc and landed on the bed next to Crookshanks. \"You shouldn't have done that,\" said Black, looking at Harry. \"You should have left him to me....\" Harry avoided Black's eyes. He wasn't sure, even now, that he'd done the right thing. \"We attacked a teacher... We attacked a teacher...\" Hermione whimpered, staring at the lifeless Snape with frightened eyes. \"Oh, we're going to be in so much trouble --\" Lupin was struggling against his bonds. Black bent down quickly and untied him. Lupin straightened up, rubbing his arms where the ropes had cut into them. \"Thank you, Harry,\" he said. \"I'm still not saying I believe you,\" he told Lupin. \"Then it's time we offered you some proof,\" said Lupin. \"You, boy -- give me Peter, please. Now.\" Ron clutched Scabbers closer to his chest. \"Come off it,\" he said weakly. \"Are you trying to say he broke out of Azkaban just to get his hands on Scabbers? I mean...\" He looked up at Harry and Hermione for support, \"Okay, say Pettigrew could turn into a rat -- there are millions of rats -- how's he supposed to know which one he's after if he was locked up in Azkaban?\" \"You know, Sirius, that's a fair question,\" said Lupin, turning to Black and frowning slightly. \"How did you find out where he was?\" Black put one of his clawlike hands inside his robes and took out a crumpled piece of paper, which he smoothed flat and held out to show the others. It was the photograph of Ron and his family that had appeared in the Daily Prophet the previous summer, and there, on Ron's shoulder, was Scabbers. \"How did you get this?\" Lupin asked Black, thunderstruck. \"Fudge,\" said Black. \"When he came to inspect Azkaban last year, he gave me his paper. And there was Peter, on the front page on this boy's shoulder... I knew him at once... how many times had I seen him transform? And the caption said the boy would be going back to Hogwarts... to where Harry was... \"My God,\" said Lupin softly, staring from Scabbers to the picture in the paper and back again. \"His front paw...\" \"What about it?\" said Ron defiantly. \"He's got a toe missing,\" said Black. \"Of course,\" Lupin breathed. \"So simple... so brilliant... he cut it off himself?\" \"Just before he transformed,\" said Black. \"When I cornered him, he yelled for the whole street to hear that I'd betrayed Lily and James. Then, before I could curse him, he blew apart the street with the wand behind his back, killed everyone within twenty feet of himself -- and sped down into the sewer with the other rats....\" \"Didn't you ever hear, Ron?\" said Lupin. \"The biggest bit of Peter they found was his finger.\" \"Look, Scabbers probably had a fight with another rat or something! He's been in my family for ages, right --\" \"Twelve years, in fact,\" said Lupin. \"Didn't you ever wonder why he was living so long?\" \"We -- we've been taking good care of him!\" said Ron. \"Not looking too good at the moment, though, is he?\" said Lupin. \"I'd guess he's been losing weight ever since he heard Sirius was on the loose again....\" \"He's been scared of that mad cat!\" said Ron, nodding toward Crookshanks, who was still purring on the bed. But that wasn't right, Harry thought suddenly... Scabbers had been looking ill before he met Crookshanks... ever since Ron's return from Egypt... since the time when Black had escaped.... \"This cat isn't mad,\" said Black hoarsely. He reached out a bony hand and stroked Crookshanks's fluffy head. \"He's the most intelligent of his kind I've ever met. He recognized Peter for what he was right away. And when he met me, he knew I was no dog. It was a while before he trusted me.... Finally, I managed to communicate to him what I was after, and he's been helping me. .. \"What do you mean?\" breathed Hermione. \"He tried to bring Peter to me, but couldn't... so he stole the passwords into Gryffindor Tower for me.... As I understand it, he took them from a boy's bedside table....\" Harry's brain seemed to be sagging under the weight of what he was hearing. It was absurd... and yet... \"But Peter got wind of what was going on and ran for it.\" croaked Black. \"This cat -- Crookshanks, did you call him? -- told me Peter had left blood on the sheets.... I supposed he bit himself... Well, faking his own death had worked once.\" These words jolted Harry to his senses. \"And why did he fake his death?\" he said furiously. \"Because he knew you were about to kill him like you killed my parents!\" \"No,\" said Lupin, \"Harry-\" \"And now you've come to finish him off!\" \"Yes, I have,\" said Black, with an evil look at Scabbers. \"Then I should've let Snape take you!\" Harry shouted. \"Harry,\" said Lupin hurriedly, \"don't you see? All this time we've thought Sirius betrayed your parents, and Peter tracked him down -- but it was the other way around, don't you see? Peter betrayed your mother and father -- Sirius tracked Peter down --\" \"THAT'S NOT TRUE!\" Harry yelled. \"HE WAS THEIR SECRET-KEEPER! HE SAID SO BEFORE YOU TURNED UP. HE SAID HE KILLED THEM!\" He was pointing at Black, who shook his head slowly; the sunken eyes were suddenly over bright. \"Harry... I as good as killed them,\" he croaked. \"I persuaded Lily and James to change to Peter at the last moment, persuaded them to use him as Secret-Keeper instead of me.... I'm to blame, I know it.... The night they died, I'd arranged to check on Peter, make sure he was still safe, but when I arrived at his hiding place, he'd gone. Yet there was no sign of a struggle. It didn't feel right. I was scared. I set out for your parents' house straight away. And when I saw their house, destroyed, and their bodies... I realized what Peter must've done... what I'd done....\" His voice broke. He turned away. \"Enough of this,\" said Lupin, and there was a steely note in his voice Harry had never heard before. \"There's one certain way to prove what really happened. Ron, give me that rat.\" \"What are you going to do with him if I give him to you?\" Ron asked Lupin tensely. \"Force him to show himself,\" said Lupin. \"If he really is a rat, it won't hurt him.\" Ron hesitated. Then at long last, he held out Scabbers and Lupin took him. Scabbers began to squeak without stopping, twisting and turning, his tiny black eyes bulging in his head. \"Ready, Sirius?\" said Lupin. Black had already retrieved Snape's wand from the bed. He approached Lupin and the struggling rat, and his wet eyes suddenly seemed to be burning in his face. \"Together?\" he said quietly. \"I think so,,, said Lupin, holding Scabbers tightly in one hand and his wand in the other. \"On the count of three. One -- two -- THREE!\" A flash of blue-white light erupted from both wands; for a moment, Scabbers was frozen in midair, his small gray form twisting madly -- Ron yelled -- the rat fell and hit the floor. There was another blinding flash of light and then -- It was like watching a speeded-up film of a growing tree. A head was shooting upward from the ground; limbs were sprouting; a moment later, a man was standing where Scabbers had been, cringing and wringing his hands. Crookshanks was spitting and snarling on the bed; the hair on his back was standing up. He was a very short man, hardly taller than Harry and Hermione. His thin, colorless hair was unkempt and there was a large bald patch on top. He had the shrunken appearance of a plump man who has lost a lot of weight in a short time. His skin looked grubby, almost like Scabbers's fur, and something of the rat lingered around his pointed nose and his very small, watery eyes. He looked around at them all, his breathing fast and shallow. Harry saw his eyes dart to the door and back again. \"Well, hello, Peter,\" said Lupin pleasantly, as though rats frequently erupted into old school friends around him. \"Long time, no see. \"S -- Sirius... R -- Remus...\" Even Pettigrew's voice was squeaky. Again, his eyes darted toward the door. \"My friends... my old friends...\" Black's wand arm rose, but Lupin seized him around the wrist, gave him a warning took, then turned again to Pettigrew, his voice light and casual. \"We've been having a little chat, Peter, about what happened the night Lily and James died. You might have missed the finer points while you were squeaking around down there on the bed --\" \"Remus,\" gasped Pettigrew, and Harry could see beads of sweat breaking out over his pasty face, \"you don't believe him, do you...? He tried to kill me, Remus....\" \"So we've heard,\" said Lupin, more coldly. \"I'd like to clear up one or two little matters with you, Peter, if you'll be so --\" \"He's come to try and kill me again!\" Pettigrew squeaked suddenly, pointing at Black, and Harry saw that he used his middle finger, because his index was missing. \"He killed Lily and James and now he's going to kill me too.... You've got to help me, Remus....\" Black's face looked more skull-like than ever as he stared at Pettigrew with his fathomless eyes. \"No one's going to try and kill you until we've sorted a few things out,\" said Lupin. \"Sorted things out?\" squealed Pettigrew, looking wildly about him once more, eyes taking in the boarded windows and, again' the only door. \"I knew he'd come after me! I knew he'd be back for me! I've been waiting for this for twelve years!\" \"You knew Sirius was going to break out of Azkaban?\" said Lupin, his brow furrowed. \"When nobody has ever done it before?\" \"He's got dark powers the rest of us can only dream of!\" Pettigrew shouted shrilly. \"How else did he get out of there? I suppose He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named taught him a few tricks!\" Black started to laugh, a horrible, mirthless laugh that filled the whole room. \"Voldemort, teach me tricks?\" he said. Pettigrew flinched as though Black had brandished a whip at him. \"What, scared to hear your old master's name?\" said Black. I don't blame you, Peter. His lot aren't very happy with you, are they?\" \"Don't know what you mean, Sirius --\" muttered Pettigrew, his breathing faster than ever. His whole face was shining with sweat now. \"You haven't been hiding from me for twelve years,\" said Black. \"You've been hiding from Voldemort's old supporters. I heard things in Azkaban, Peter... They all think you're dead, or you'd have to answer to them.... I've heard them screaming all sorts of things in their sleep. Sounds like they think the double-crosser double-crossed them. Voldemort went to the Potters' on your information... and Voldemort met his downfall there. And not all Voldemort's supporters ended up in Azkaban, did they? There are still plenty out here, biding their time, pretending they've seen the error of their ways. If they ever got wind that you were still alive, Peter --\" \"Don't know... what you're talking about...,\" said Pettigrew again, more shrilly than ever. He wiped his face on his sleeve and looked up at Lupin. \"You don't believe this -- this madness, Remus --\" \"I must admit, Peter, I have difficulty in understanding why an innocent man would want to spend twelve years as a rat,\" said Lupin evenly. \"Innocent, but scared!\" squealed Pettigrew. \"If Voldemort's supporters were after me, it was because I put one of their best men in Azkaban -- the spy, Sirius Black!\" Black's face contorted. \"How dare you,\" he growled, sounding suddenly like the bearsized dog he had been. I, a spy for Voldemort? When did I ever sneak around people who were stronger and more powerful than myself? But you, Peter -- I'll never understand why I didn't see you were the spy from the start. You always liked big friends who'd look after you, didn't you? It used to be us... me and Remus... and James.... Pettigrew wiped his face again; he was almost panting for breath. \"Me, a spy... must be out of your mind... never... don't know how you can say such a --\" \"Lily and James only made you Secret-Keeper because I suggested it,\" Black hissed, so venomously that Pettigrew took a step backward. \"I thought it was the perfect plan... a bluff... Voldemort would be sure to come after me, would never dream they'd use a weak, talentless thing like you.... It must have been the finest moment of your miserable life, telling Voldemort you could hand him the Potters.\" Pettigrew was muttering distractedly; Harry caught words like \"far-fetched\" and \"lunacy,\" but he couldn't help paying more attention to the ashen color of Pettigrew's face and the way his eyes continued to dart toward the windows and door. \"Professor Lupin?\" said Hermione timidly. \"Can -- can I say something?\" \"Certainly, Hermione,\" said Lupin courteously. \"Well -- Scabbers -- I mean, this -- this man -- he's been sleeping in Harry's dormitory for three years. If he's working for You-Know-Who, how come he never tried to hurt Harry before now?\" \"There!\" said Pettigrew shrilly, pointing at Ron with his maimed hand. \"Thank you! You see, Remus? I have never hurt a hair of Harry's head! Why should I?\" \"I'll tell you why,\" said Black. \"Because you never did anything for anyone unless you could see what was in it for you. Voldemort's been in hiding for fifteen years, they say he's half dead. You weren't about to commit murder right under Albus Dumbledore's nose, for a wreck of a wizard who'd lost all of his power, were you? You'd want to be quite sure he was the biggest bully in the playground before you went back to him, wouldn't you? Why else did you find a wizard family to take you in? Keeping an ear out for news, weren't YOU, Peter? Just in case your old protector regained strength, and it was safe to rejoin him....\" Pettigrew opened his mouth and closed it several times. He seemed to have lost the ability to talk. \"Er -- Mr. Black -- Sirius?\" said Hermione. Black jumped at being addressed like this and stared at Hermione as though he had never seen anything quite like her. \"If you don't mind me asking, how -- how did you get out of Azkaban, if you didn't use Dark Magic?\" \"Thank you!\" gasped Pettigrew, nodding frantically at her. \"Exactly! Precisely what I --\" But Lupin silenced him with a look. Black was frowning slightly at Hermione, but not as though he were annoyed with her. He seemed to be pondering his answer. \"I don't know how I did it,\" he said slowly. \"I think the only reason I never lost my mind is that I knew I was innocent. That wasn't a happy thought, so the dementors couldn't suck it out of me... but it kept me sane and knowing who I am... helped me keep my powers... so when it all became ... too much... I could transform in my cell... become a dog. Dementors can't see, you know....\" He swallowed. \"They feel their way toward people by feeding off their emotions.... They could tell that my feelings were less -- less human, less complex when I was a dog... but they thought, of course, that I was losing my mind like everyone else in there, so it didn't trouble them. But I was weak, very weak, and I had no hope of driving them away from me without a wand....\" \"But then I saw Peter in that picture... I realized he was at Hogwarts with Harry... perfectly positioned to act, if one hint reached his ears that the Dark Side was gathering strength again....\" Pettigrew was shaking his head, mouthing noiselessly, but staring all the while at Black as though hypnotized. \"... ready to strike at the moment he could be sure of allies... and to deliver the last Potter to them. if he gave them Harry, who'd dare say he'd betrayed Lord Voldemort? He'd be welcomed back with honors.... \"So you see, I had to do something. I was the only one who knew Peter was still alive....\" Harry remembered what Mr. Weasley had told Mrs. Wealsey. \"The guards say he's been talking in his sleep... always the same words... 'He's at Hogwarts.'\" \"It was as if someone had lit a fire In my head, and the dementors couldn't destroy it.... It wasn't a happy feeling... it was an obsession... but it gave me strength, it cleared my mind. So, one night when they opened my door to bring food, I slipped past them as a dog.... It's so much harder for them to sense animal emotions that they were confused.... I was thin, very thin... thin enough to slip through the bars.... I swam as a dog back to the mainland.... I journeyed north and slipped into the Hogwarts grounds as a dog. I've been living in the forest ever since, except when I came to watch the Quidditch, of course. You fly as well as your father did, Harry....\" He looked at Harry, who did not look away. \"Believe me,\" croaked Black. \"Believe me, Harry. I never betrayed James and Lily. I would have died before I betrayed them.\" And at long last, Harry believed him. Throat too tight to speak, he nodded. \"No!\" Pettigrew had fallen to his knees as though Harry's nod had been his own death sentence. He shuffled forward on his knees, groveling, his hands clasped in front of him as though praying. \"Sirius -- it's me... it's Peter... your friend... you wouldn't --\" Black kicked out and Pettigrew recoiled. \"There's enough filth on my robes without you touching them,\" said Black. \"Remus!\" Pettigrew squeaked, turning to Lupin instead, writhing imploringly in front of him. \"You don't believe this wouldn't Sirius have told you they'd changed the plan?\" \"Not if he thought I was the spy, Peter,\" said Lupin. \"I assume that's why you didn't tell me, Sirius?\" he said casually over Pettigrews head. \"Forgive me, Remus,\" said Black. \"Not at all, Padfoot, old friend,\" said Lupin, who was now rolling up his sleeves. \"And will you, in turn, forgive me for believing you were the spy?\" \"Of course,\" said Black, and the ghost of a grin flitted across his gaunt face. He, too, began rolling up his sleeves. \"Shall we kill him together?\" \"Yes, I think so,\" said Lupin grimly. \"You wouldn't... you won't...,\" gasped Pettigrew. And he scrambled around to Ron. \"Ron... haven't I been a good friend... a good pet? You won't let them kill me, Ron, will you... you're on my side, aren't you. But Ron was staring at Pettigrew with the utmost revulsion. \"I let you sleep in my bed!\" he said. \"Kind boy... kind master...\" Pettigrew crawled toward Ron \"You won't let them do it.... I was your rat.... I was a good pet....\" \"If you made a better rat than a human, it's not much to boast about, Peter,\" said Black harshly. Ron, going still paler with pain, wrenched his broken leg out of Pettigrew's reach. Pettigrew turned on his knees, staggered forward, and seized the hem of Hermione's robes. \"Sweet girl... clever girl... you -- you won't let them.... Help me....\" Hermione pulled her robes out of Pettigrew's clutching hands and backed away against the wall, looking horrified. Pettigrew knelt, trembling uncontrollably, and-turned his head slowly toward Harry. \"Harry... Harry... you look just like your father... just like him....\" \"HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO HARRY?\" roared Black. \"HOW DARE YOU FACE HIM? HOW DARE YOU TALK ABOUT JAMES IN FRONT OF HIM?\" \"Harry,\" whispered Pettigrew, shuffling toward him, hands outstretched. \"Harry, James wouldn't have wanted me killed.... James would have understood, Harry... he would have shown me mercy...\" Both Black and Lupin strode forward, seized Pettigrew's shoulders, and threw him backward onto the floor. He sat there, twitching with terror, staring up at them. \"You sold Lily and James to Voldemort,\" said Black, who was shaking too. \"Do you deny it?\" Pettigrew burst into tears. It was horrible to watch, like an oversized, balding baby, cowering on the floor. \"Sirius, Sirius, what could I have done? The Dark Lord... you have no idea... he has weapons you can't imagine.... I was scared, Sirius, I was never brave like you and Remus and James. I never meant it to happen.... He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named forced me --\" \"DON'T LIE!\" bellowed Black. \"YOU'D BEEN PASSING INFORMATION TO HIM FOR A YEAR BEFORE LILY AND JAMES DIED! YOU WERE HIS SPY!\" \"He -- he was taking over everywhere!\" gasped Pettigrew. \"Wh -- what was there to be gained by refusing him?\" \"What was there to be gained by fighting the most evil wizard who has ever existed?\" said Black, with a terrible fury in his face. \"Only innocent lives, Peter!\" \"You don't understand!\" whined Pettigrew. \"He would have killed me, Sirius!\" \"THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE DIED!\" roared Black. \"DIED RATHER THAN BETRAY YOUR FRIENDS, AS WE WOULD HAVE DONE FOR YOU!\" Black and Lupin stood shoulder to shoulder, wands raised. \"You should have realized,\" said Lupin quietly, \"if Voldemort didn't kill you, we would. Good-bye, Peter.\" Hermione covered her face with her hands and turned to the wall. \"NO!\" Harry yelled. He ran forward, placing himself in front Pettigrew, facing the wands. \"You can't kill him,\" he said breathlessly. \"You can't.\" Black and Lupin both looked staggered. \"Harry, this piece of vermin is the reason you have no parents,\" Black snarled. \"This cringing bit of filth would have seen you die too, without turning a hair. You heard him. His own stinking skin meant more to him than your whole family.\" \"I know,\" Harry panted. \"We'll take him up to the castle. We'll hand him over to the dementors.... He can go to Azkaban... but don't kill him.\" \"Harry!\" gasped Pettigrew, and he flung his arms around Harry's knees. \"You -- thank you -- it's more than I deserve -- thank you --\" \"Get off me,\" Harry spat, throwing Pettigrew's hands off him in disgust. \"I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing it because -- I don't reckon my dad would've wanted them to become killers -- just for you.\" No one moved or made a sound except Pettigrew, whose breath was coming in wheezes as he clutched his chest. Black and Lupin were looking at each other. Then, with one movement, they lowered their wands. \"You're the only person who has the right to decide, Harry,\" said Black. \"But think... think what he did....\" \"He can go to Azkaban,\" Harry repeated. \"If anyone deserves that place, he does....\" Pettigrew was still wheezing behind him. \"Very well,\" said Lupin. \"Stand aside, Harry.\" Harry hesitated. \"I'm going to tie him up,\" said Lupin. \"That's all, I swear.\" Harry stepped out of the way. Thin cords shot from Lupin's wand this time, and next moment, Pettigrew was wriggling on the floor, bound and gagged. \"But if you transform, Peter,\" growled Black, his own wand pointing at Pettigrew too, \"we will kill you. You agree, Harry?\" Harry looked down at the pitiful figure on the floor and nodded so that Pettigrew could see him. \"Right,\" said Lupin, suddenly businesslike. \"Ron, I can't mend bones nearly as well as Madam Pomfrey, so I think it's best if we just strap your leg up until we can get you to the hospital wing.\" He hurried over to Ron, bent down, tapped Ron's leg with his wand, and muttered, \"Ferula.\" Bandages spun up Ron's leg, strapping it tightly to a splint. Lupin helped him to his feet; Ron put his weight gingerly on the leg and didn't wince. \"That's better,\" he said. \"Thanks.\" \"What about Professor Snape?\" said Hermione in a small voice, looking down at Snape's prone figure. \"There's nothing seriously wrong with him,\" said Lupin, bending over Snape and checking his pulse. \"You were just a little -- overenthusiastic. Still out cold. Er -- perhaps it will be best if we don't revive him until we're safety back in the castle. We can take him like this....\" He muttered, \"Mobilicorpus.\" As though invisible strings were tied to Snape's wrists, neck, and knees, he was pulled into a standing position, head still lolling unpleasantly, like a grotesque puppet. He hung a few inches above the ground, his limp feet dangling. Lupin picked up the Invisibility Cloak and tucked it safely into his pocket. \"And two of us should be chained to this,\" said Black, nudging Pettigrew with his toe. \"Just to make sure.\" \"I'll do it,\" said Lupin. \"And me,\" said Ron savagely, limping forward. Black conjured heavy manacles from thin air; soon Pettigrew was upright again, left arm chained to Lupin's right, right arm to Ron's left. Ron's face was set. He seemed to have taken Scabbers's true identity as a personal insult. Crookshanks leapt lightly off the bed and led the way out of the room, his bottlebrush tail held jauntily high. \n",

            " THIRTYTHREE  THE DEATH EATERS Voldemort looked away from Harry and began examining his own body. His hands were like large, pale spiders; his long white fingers caressed his own chest, his arms, his face; the red eyes, whose pupils were slits, like a cats, gleamed still more brightly through the darkness. He held up his hands and flexed the fingers, his expression rapt and exultant. He took not the slightest notice of Wormtail, who lay twitching and bleeding on the ground, nor of the great snake, which had slithered back into sight and was circling Harry again, hissing. Voldemort slipped one of those unnaturally longfingered hands into a deep pocket and drew out a wand. He caressed it gently too; and then he raised it, and pointed it at Wormtail, who was lifted off the ground and thrown against the headstone where Harry was tied; he fell to the foot of it and lay there, crumpled up and crying. Voldemort turned his scarlet eyes upon Harry, laughing a high, cold, mirthless laugh. Wormtail's robes were shining with blood now; he had wrapped the stump of his arm in them. \"My Lord . . .\" he choked, \"my Lord . . . you promised . . . you did promise ...\" \"Hold out your arm,\" said Voldemort lazily. \"Oh Master . . . thank you, Master ...\" He extended the bleeding stump, but Voldemort laughed again. \"The other arm, Wormtail.\" \"Master, please . . .please ...\" Voldemort bent down and pulled out Wormtail's left arm; he forced the sleeve of Wormtail's robes up past his elbow, and Harry saw something upon the skin there, something like a vivid red tattoo  a skull with a snake protruding from its mouth  the image that had appeared in the sky at the Quidditch World Cup: the Dark Mark. Voldemort examined it carefully, ignoring Wormtail's uncontrollable weeping. \"It is back,\" he said softly, \"they will all have noticed it... and now, we shall see ... now we shall know ...\" He pressed his long white forefinger to the brand on Wormtail's arm. The scar on Harry s forehead seared with a sharp pain again, and Wormtail let out a fresh howl; Voldemort removed his fingers from Wormtail's mark, and Harry saw that it had turned jet black. A look of cruel satisfaction on his face, Voldemort straightened up, threw back his head, and stared around at the dark graveyard. \"How many will be brave enough to return when they feel it?\" he whispered, his gleaming red eyes fixed upon the stars. \"And how many will be foolish enough to stay away?\" He began to pace up and down before Harry and Wormtail, eyes sweeping the graveyard all the while. After a minute or so, he looked down at Harry again, a cruel smile twisting his snakelike face. \"You stand, Harry Potter, upon the remains of my late father,\" he hissed softly. \"A Muggle and a fool. . . very like your dear mother. But they both had their uses, did they not? Your mother died to defend you as a child . . . and I killed my father, and see how useful he has proved himself, in death. ...\" Voldemort laughed again. Up and down he paced, looking all around him as he walked, and the snake continued to circle in the grass. \"You see that house upon the hillside, Potter? My father lived there. My mother, a witch who lived here in this village, fell in love with him. But he abandoned her when she told him what she was. ... He didn't like magic, my father . . . \"He left her and returned to his Muggle parents before I was even born. Potter, and she died giving birth to me, leaving me to be raised in a Muggle orphanage . . . but I vowed to find him ... I revenged myself upon him, that fool who gave me his name . . . Tom Riddle. . . .\" Still he paced, his red eyes darting from grave to grave. \"Listen to me, reliving family history . . .\" he said quietly, \"why, I am growing quite sentimental. . . . But look, Harry! My true family returns. . . .\" The air was suddenly full of the swishing of cloaks. Between graves, behind the yew tree, in every shadowy space, wizards were Apparating. All of them were hooded and masked. And one by one they moved forward . . . slowly, cautiously, as though they could hardly believe their eyes Voldemort stood in silence, waiting for them. Then one of the Death Eaters fell to his knees, crawled toward Voldemort and kissed the hem of his black robes. Master . . . Master \" he murmured. The Death Eaters behind him did the same; each of them approaching Voldemort on his knees and kissing his robes, before backing away and standing up, forming a silent circle, which enclosed Tom Riddle s grave, Harry, Voldemort, and the sobbing and twitching heap that was Wormtail. Yet they left gaps in the circle, as though waiting for more people. Voldemort, however, did not seem to expect more. He looked around at the hooded faces, and though there was no wind rustling seemed to run around the circle, as though it had shivered. \"Welcome, Death Eaters,\" said Voldemort quietly. \"Thirteen years. . . thirteen years since last we met. Yet you answer my call as though it were yesterday, we are still united under the Dark Mark, then! Or are we?\" He put back his terrible face and sniffed, his slitlike nostrils widening. \"I smell guilt,\" he said. \"There is a stench or guilt upon the air. A second shiver ran around the circle, as though each member of it longed, but did not dare to step back from him. \"I see you all, whole and healthy, with your powers intact  such prompt appearances! and I ask myself . . . why did this band of wizards never come to the aid of their master, to whom they swore eternal loyalty?\" No one spoke. No one moved except Wormtail, who was upon the ground, still sobbing over his bleeding arm. \"And I answer myself,\" whispered Voldemort, \"they must have believed me broken, they thought I was gone. They slipped back among my enemies, and they pleaded innocence, and ignorance, and bewitchment. . . . \"And then I ask myself, but how could they have believed I would not rise again! They, who knew the steps I took, long ago, to guard myself against mortal death! They, who had seen proofs of the immensity of my power in the times when I was mightier than any wizard living! \"And I answer myself, perhaps they believed a still greater power could exist, one that could vanquish even Lord Voldemort. . . perhaps they now pay allegiance to another . . . perhaps that champion of commoners, of Mudbloods and Muggles, Albus Dumbledore?\" At the mention of Dumbledore's name, the members of the circle stirred, and some muttered and shook their heads. Voldemort ignored them. \"It is a disappointment to me ... I confess myself disappointed. . . .\" One of the men suddenly flung himself forward, breaking the circle. Trembling from head to foot, he collapsed at Voldemort's feet. \"Master!\" he shrieked, \"Master, forgive me! Forgive us all!\" Voldemort began to laugh. He raised his wand. \"Crucio!\" The Death Eater on the ground writhed and shrieked; Harry was sure the sound must carry to the houses around. . . . Let the police come, he thought desperately . . . anyone . .. anything. . . Voldemort raised his wand. The tortured Death Eater lay flat upon the ground, gasping. \"Get up, Avery,\" said Voldemort softly. \"Stand up. You ask for forgiveness? I do not forgive. I do not forget. Thirteen long years ... I want thirteen years' repayment before I forgive you. Wormtail here has paid some of his debt already, have you not, Wormtail?\" He looked down at Wormtail, who continued to sob. \"You returned to me, not out of loyalty, but out of fear of your old friends. You deserve this pain, Wormtail. You know that, don't you?\" \"Yes, Master,\" moaned Wormtail, \"please. Master . . . please ...\" \"Yet you helped return me to my body,\" said Voldemort coolly, watching Wormtail sob on the ground. \"Worthless and traitorous as you are, you helped me ... and Lord Voldemort rewards his helpers... .\" Voldemort raised his wand again and whirled it through the air. A streak of what looked like molten silver hung shining in the wand's wake. Momentarily shapeless, it writhed and then formed itself into a gleaming replica of a human hand, bright as moonlight, which soared downward and fixed itself upon Wormtails bleeding wrist. Wormtail's sobbing stopped abruptly. His breathing harsh and ragged, he raised his head and stared in disbelief at the silver hand, now attached seamlessly to his arm, as though he were wearing a dazzling glove. He flexed the shining fingers, then, trembling, picked up a small twig on the ground and crushed it into powder. \"My Lord,\" he whispered. \"Master ... it is beautiful. . . thank you... thank you. ...\" He scrambled forward on his knees and kissed the hem of Voldemort's robes. \"May your loyalty never waver again, Wormtail,\" said Voldemort. \"No, my Lord . . . never, my Lord . . .\" Wormtail stood up and took his place in the circle, staring at his powerful new hand, his face still shining with tears. Voldemort now approached the man on Wormtail's right. \"Lucius, my slippery friend,\" he whispered, halting before him. \"I am told that you have not renounced the old ways, though to the world you present a respectable face. You are still ready to take the lead in a spot of Muggletorture, I believe? Yet you never tried to find me, Lucius. . . . Your exploits at the Quidditch World Cup were fun, I daresay. . . but might not your energies have been better directed toward finding and aiding your master?\" \"My Lord, I was constantly on the alert,\" came Lucius Malfoy's voice swiftly from beneath the hood. \"Had there been any sign from you, any whisper of your whereabouts, I would have been at your side immediately, nothing could have prevented me \" \"And yet you ran from my Mark, when a faithful Death Eater sent it into the sky last summer?\" said Voldemort lazily, and Mr. Malfoy stopped talking abruptly. \"Yes, I know all about that, Lucius. . . . You have disappointed me. ... I expect more faithful service in the future.\" \"Of course, my Lord, of course. . . . You are merciful, thank you. ...\" Voldemort moved on, and stopped, staring at the space  large enough for two people  that separated Malfoy and the next man. \"The Lestranges should stand here,\" said Voldemort quietly. \"But they are entombed in Azkaban. They were faithful. They went to Azkaban rather than renounce me. . . . When Azkaban is broken open, the Lestranges will be honored beyond their dreams. The dementors will join us ... they are our natural allies ... we will recall the banished giants ... I shall have all my devoted servants returned to me, and an army of creatures whom all fear. ...\" He walked on. Some of the Death Eaters he passed in silence, but he paused before others and spoke to them. \"Macnair . . . destroying dangerous beasts for the Ministry of Magic now, Wormtail tells me? You shall have better victims than that soon, Macnair. Lord Voldemort will provide. ...\" \"Thank you, Master . . . thank you,\" murmured Macnair. \"And here\"  Voldemort moved on to the two largest hooded figures  \"we have Crabbe . . . you will do better this time, will you not, Crabbe? And you, Goyle?\" They bowed clumsily, muttering dully. \"Yes, Master ...\" \"We will, Master....\" \"The same goes for you, Nott,\" said Voldemort quietly as he walked past a stooped figure in Mr. Goyles shadow. \"My Lord, I prostrate myself before you, I am your most faithful \" \"That will do,\" said Voldemort. He had reached the largest gap of all, and he stood surveying it with his blank, red eyes, as though he could see people standing there. \"And here we have six missing Death Eaters . . . three dead in my service. One, too cowardly to return ... he will pay. One, who I believe has left me forever ... he will be killed, of course . . . and one, who remains my most faithful servant, and who has already reentered my service.\" The Death Eaters stirred, and Harry saw their eyes dart sideways at one another through their masks. \"He is at Hogwarts, that faithful servant, and it was through his efforts that our young friend arrived here tonight. . . . \"Yes,\" said Voldemort, a grin curling his lipless mouth as the eyes of the circle flashed in Harry's direction. \"Harry Potter has kindly joined us for my rebirthing party. One might go so far as to call him my guest of honor.\" There was a silence. Then the Death Eater to the right of Wormtail stepped forward, and Lucius Malfoy's voice spoke from under the mask. \"Master, we crave to know ... we beg you to tell us ... how you have achieved this . . . this miracle . . . how you managed to return to us. .. .\" \"Ah, what a story it is, Lucius,\" said Voldemort. \"And it begins  and ends  with my young friend here.\" He walked lazily over to stand next to Harry, so that the eyes of the whole circle were upon the two of them. The snake continued to circle. \"You know, of course, that they have called this boy my downfall?\" Voldemort said softly, his red eyes upon Harry, whose scar began to burn so fiercely that he almost screamed in agony. \"You all know that on the night I lost my powers and my body, I tried to kill him. His mother died in the attempt to save him  and unwittingly provided him with a protection I admit I had not foreseen. ... I could not touch the boy.\" Voldemort raised one of his long white fingers and put it very close to Harry's cheek. \"His mother left upon him the traces other sacrifice. . . . This is old magic, I should have remembered it, I was foolish to overlook it... but no matter. I can touch him now.\" Harry felt the cold tip of the long white finger touch him, and thought his head would burst with the pain. Voldemort laughed softly in his ear, then took the finger away and continued addressing the Death Eaters. \"I miscalculated, my friends, I admit it. My curse was deflected by the woman's foolish sacrifice, and it rebounded upon myself. Aaah . . . pain beyond pain, my friends; nothing could have prepared me for it. I was ripped from my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost. . . but still, I was alive. What I was, even I do not know... I, who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality. You know my goal  to conquer death. And now, I was tested, and it appeared that one or more of my experiments had worked ... for I had not been killed, though the curse should have done it. Nevertheless, I was as powerless as the weakest creature alive, and without the means to help myself... for I had no body, and every spell that might have helped me required the use of a wand. . . . \"I remember only forcing myself, sleeplessly, endlessly, second by second, to exist. ... I settled in a faraway place, in a forest, and I waited. . . . Surely, one of my faithful Death Eaters would try and find me. . . one of them would come and perform the magic I could not, to restore me to a body . . , but I waited in vain. ...\" The shiver ran once more around the circle of listening Death Eaters. Voldemort let the silence spiral horribly before continuing. \"Only one power remained to me. I could possess the bodies of others. But I dared not go where other humans were plentiful, for I knew that the Aurors were still abroad and searching for me. I sometimes inhabited animals  snakes, of course, being my preference  but I was little better off inside them than as pure spirit, for their bodies were ill adapted to perform magic . . . and my possession of them shortened their lives; none of them lasted long. . . . \"Then . . . four years ago . . . the means for my return seemed assured. A wizard  young, foolish, and gullible  wandered across my path in the forest I had made my home. Oh, he seemed the very chance I had been dreaming of... for he was a teacher at Dumbledore's school... he was easy to bend to my will... he brought me back to this country, and after a while, I took possession of his body, to supervise him closely as he carried out my orders. But my plan failed. I did not manage to steal the Sorcerer's Stone. I was not to be assured immortal life. I was thwarted . . . thwarted, once again, by Harry Potter. ...\" Silence once more; nothing was stirring, not even the leaves on the yew tree. The Death Eaters were quite motionless, the glittering eyes in their masks fixed upon Voldemort, and upon Harry. \"The servant died when I left his body, and I was left as weak as ever I had been,\" Voldemort continued. \"I returned to my hiding place far away, and I will not pretend to you that I didn't then fear that I might never regain my powers. . . . Yes, that was perhaps my darkest hour... I could not hope that I would be sent another wizard to possess . . . and I had given up hope, now, that any of my Death Eaters cared what had become of me. ...\" One or two of the masked wizards in the circle moved uncomfortably, but Voldemort took no notice. \"And then, not even a year ago, when I had almost abandoned hope, it happened at last... a servant returned to me. Wormtail here, who had faked his own death to escape justice, was driven out of hiding by those he had once counted friends, and decided to return to his master. He sought me in the country where it had long been rumored I was hiding . . . helped, of course, by the rats he met along the way. Wormtail has a curious affinity with rats, do you not, Wormtail? His filthy little friends told him there was a place, deep in an Albanian forest, that they avoided, where small animals like themselves had met their deaths by a dark shadow that possessed them. . . . \"But his journey back to me was not smooth, was it, Wormtail? For, hungry one night, on the edge of the very forest where he had hoped to find me, he foolishly stopped at an inn for some food . . . and who should he meet there, but one Bertha Jorkins, a witch from the Ministry of Magic. \"Now see the way that fate favors Lord Voldemort. This might have been the end of Wormtail, and of my last hope for regeneration. But Wormtail  displaying a presence of mind I would never have expected from him  convinced Bertha Jorkins to accompany him on a nighttime stroll. He overpowered her ... he brought her to me. And Bertha Jorkins, who might have ruined all, proved instead to be a gift beyond my wildest dreams ... for  with a little persuasion  she became a veritable mine of information. \"She told me that the Triwizard Tournament would be played at Hogwarts this year. She told me that she knew of a faithful Death Eater who would be only too willing to help me, if I could only contact him. She told me many things. . . but the means I used to break the Memory Charm upon her were powerful, and when I had extracted all useful information from her, her mind and body were both damaged beyond repair. She had now served her purpose. I could not possess her. I disposed of her.\" Voldemort smiled his terrible smile, his red eyes blank and pitiless. \"Wormtail's body, of course, was ill adapted for possession, as all assumed him dead, and would attract far too much attention if noticed. However, he was the ablebodied servant I needed, and, poor wizard though he is, Wormtail was able to follow the instructions I gave him, which would return me to a rudimentary, weak body of my own, a body I would be able to inhabit while awaiting the essential ingredients for true rebirth ... a spell or two of my own invention ... a little help from my dear Nagini,\" Voldemorts red eyes fell upon the continually circling snake, \"a potion concocted from unicorn blood, and the snake venom Nagini provided ... I was soon returned to an almost human form, and strong enough to travel. \"There was no hope of stealing the Sorcerer's Stone anymore, for I knew that Dumbledore would have seen to it that it was destroyed. But I was willing to embrace mortal life again, before chasing immortality. I set my sights lower ... I would settle for my old body back again, and my old strength. \"I knew that to achieve this  it is an old piece of Dark Magic, the potion that revived me tonight  I would need three powerful ingredients. Well, one of them was already at hand, was it not, Wormtail? Flesh given by a servant. . . . \"My father's bone, naturally, meant that we would have to come here, where he was buried. But the blood of a foe ... Wormtail would have had me use any wizard, would you not, Wormtail? Any wizard who had hated me ... as so many of them still do. But I knew the one I must use, if I was to rise again, more powerful than I had been when I had fallen. I wanted Harry Potters blood. I wanted the blood of the one who had stripped me of power thirteen years ago . . . for the lingering protection his mother once gave him would then reside in my veins too. . \"But how to get at Harry Potter? For he has been better protected than I think even he knows, protected in ways devised by Dumbledore long ago, when it fell to him to arrange the boy's future. Dumbledore invoked an ancient magic, to ensure the boy's protection as long as he is in his relations' care. Not even I can touch him there. . . . Then, of course, there was the Quidditch World Cup. ... I thought his protection might be weaker there, away from his relations and Dumbledore, but I was not yet strong enough to attempt kidnap in the midst of a horde of Ministry wizards. And then, the boy would return to Hogwarts, where he is under the crooked nose of that Muggleloving fool from morning until night. So how could I take him! \"Why ... by using Bertha Jorkins's information, of course. Use my one faithful Death Eater, stationed at Hogwarts, to ensure that the boy's name was entered into the Goblet of Fire. Use my Death Eater to ensure that the boy won the tournament  that he touched the Triwizard Cup first  the cup which my Death Eater had turned into a Portkey, which would bring him here, beyond the reach of Dumbledore's help and protection, and into my waiting arms. And here he is ... the boy you all believed had been my downfall. ...\" Voldemort moved slowly forward and turned to face Harry. He raised his wand. \"Crucio!\" It was pain beyond anything Harry had ever experienced; his very bones were on fire; his head was surely splitting along his scar; his eyes were rolling madly in his head; he wanted it to end ... to black out... to die ... And then it was gone. He was hanging limply in the ropes binding him to the headstone of Voldemort's father, looking up into those bright red eyes through a kind of mist. The night was ringing with the sound of the Death Eaters' laughter. \"You see, I think, how foolish it was to suppose that this boy could ever have been stronger than me,\" said Voldemort. \"But I want there to be no mistake in anybody's mind. Harry Potter escaped me by a lucky chance. And I am now going to prove my power by killing him, here and now, in front of you all, when there is no Dumbledore to help him, and no mother to die for him. I will give him his chance. He will be allowed to fight, and you will be left in no doubt which of us is the stronger. Just a little longer, Nagini,\" he whispered, and the snake glided away through the grass to where the Death Eaters stood watching. \"Now untie him, Wormtail, and give him back his wand.\" \n",

            ": The Slug Club Harry spent a lot of the last week of the holidays pondering the meaning of Malfoy's behavior in Knockturn Alley. What disturbed him most was the satisfied look on Malfoy's face as he had left the shop. Nothing that made Malfoy look that happy could be good news. To his slight annoyance, however, neither Ron nor Hermione seemed quite as curious about Malfoy's activities as he was; or at least, they seemed to get bored of discussing it after a few days. \"Yes, I've already agreed it was fishy, Harry,\" said Hermione a little impatiently. She was sitting on the windowsill in Fred and George's room with her feet up on one of the cardboard boxes and had only grudgingly looked up from her new copy of Advanced Rune Translation. \"But haven't we agreed there could be a lot of explanations?\" \"Maybe he's broken his Hand of Glory\" said Ron vaguely, as he attempted to straighten his broomstick's bent tail twigs. \"Remember that shriveled-up arm Malfoy had?\" \"But what about when he said, 'Don't forget to keep that one safe'?\" asked Harry for the umpteenth time. \"That sounded to me like Borgin's got another one of the broken objects, and Malfoy wants both.\" \"You reckon?\" said Ron, now trying to scrape some dirt off his broom handle. \"Yeah, I do,\" said Harry. When neither Ron nor Hermione answered, he said, \"Malfoy's father's in Azkaban. Don't you think Malfoy’d like revenge?\" Ron looked up, blinking. \"Malfoy, revenge? What can he do about it?\" \"That's my point, I don't know!\" said Harry, frustrated. \"But he's up to something and I think we should take it seriously. His father's a Death Eater and ...\" Harry broke off, his eyes fixed on the window behind Hermione, his mouth open. A startling thought had just occurred to him. \"Harry?\" said Hermione in an anxious voice. \"What's wrong?\" \"Your scar's not hurting again, is it?\" asked Ron nervously. \"He's a Death Eater,\" said Harry slowly. \"He's replaced his father as a Death Eater!\" There was a silence; then Ron erupted in laughter. \"Malfoy? He's sixteen, Harry! You think You-Know-Who would let Malfoy join?\" \"It seems very unlikely, Harry,\" said Hermione in a repressive sort of voice. \"What makes you think ... ?\" \"In Madam Malkin's. She didn't touch him, but he yelled and jerked his arm away from her when she went to roll up his sleeve. It was his left arm. He's been branded with the Dark Mark.\" Ron and Hermione looked at each other. \"Well...\" said Ron, sounding thoroughly unconvinced. \"I think he just wanted to get out of there, Harry,\" said Hermione. \"He showed Borgin something we couldn't see,\" Harry pressed on stubbornly. \"Something that seriously scared Borgin. It was the Mark, I know it... he was showing Borgin who he was dealing with, you saw how seriously Borgin took him!\" Ron and Hermione exchanged another look. \"I'm not sure, Harry...\" \"Yeah, I still don't reckon You-Know-Who would let Malfoy join...\" Annoyed, but absolutely convinced he was right, Harry snatched up a pile of filthy Quidditch robes and left the room; Mrs. Weasley had been urging them for days not to leave their washing and packing until the last moment. On the landing he bumped into Ginny, who was returning to her room carrying a pile of freshly laundered clothes. \"I wouldn't go in the kitchen just now,\" she warned him. \"There's a lot of Phlegm around.\" \"I'll be careful not to slip in it.\" Harry smiled. Sure enough, when he entered the kitchen it was to find Fleur sitting at the kitchen table, in full flow about plans for her wedding to Bill, while Mrs. Weasley kept watch over a pile of self-peeling sprouts, looking bad-tempered. \"... Bill and I 'ave almost decided on only two bridesmaids, Ginny and Gabrielle will look very sweet togezzer. I am theenking of dressing zem in pale gold, pink would of course be 'orrible with Ginny's 'air!\" \"Ah, Harry!\" said Mrs. Weasley loudly, cutting across Fleur's monologue. \"Good, I wanted to explain about the security arrangements for the journey to Hogwarts tomorrow. We've got Ministry cars again, and there will be Aurors waiting at the station.\" \"Is Tonks going to be there?\" asked Harry, handing over his Quidditch things. \"No, I don't think so, she's been stationed somewhere else from what Arthur said.\" \"She has let 'erself go, zat Tonks,\" Fleur mused, examining her own stunning reflection in the back of a teaspoon. \"A big mistake if you ask.\" \"Yes, thank you,\" said Mrs. Weasley tartly, cutting across Fleur again. \"You'd better get on, Harry, I want the trunks ready tonight, if possible, so we don't have the usual last-minute scramble.\" And in fact, their departure the following morning was smoother than usual. The Ministry cars glided up to the front of the Burrow to find them waiting, trunks packed; Hermione's cat, Crookshanks, safely enclosed in his traveling basket; and Hedwig; Ron's owl, Pig-widgeon; and Ginny's new purple Pygmy Puff, Arnold, in cages. \"Au revoir, 'Any,\" said Fleur throatily, kissing him good-bye. Ron hurried forward, looking hopeful, but Ginny stuck out her foot and Ron fell, sprawling in the dust at Fleur's feet. Furious, red-faced, and dirt-spattered, he hurried into the car without saying good-bye. There was no cheerful Hagrid waiting for them at King's Cross Station. Instead, two grim-faced, bearded Aurors in dark Muggle suits moved forward the moment the cars stopped and, flanking the party, marched them into the station without speaking. \"Quick, quick, through the barrier,\" said Mrs. Weasley, who seemed a little flustered by this austere efficiency. \"Harry had better go first, with...\" She looked inquiringly at one of the Aurors, who nodded briefly, seized Harry's upper arm, and attempted to steer him toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten. \"I can walk, thanks,\" said Harry irritably, jerking his arm out of the Auror's grip. He pushed his trolley directly at the solid barrier, ignoring his silent companion, and found himself, a second later, standing on platform nine and three-quarters, where the scarlet Hogwarts Express stood belching steam over the crowd. Hermione and the Weasleys joined him within seconds. Without waiting to consult his grim-faced Auror, Harry motioned to Ron and Hermione to follow him up the platform, looking for an empty compartment. \"We can't, Harry,\" said Hermione, looking apologetic. \"Ron and I've got to go to the prefects' carriage first and then patrol the corridors for a bit.\" \"Oh yeah, I forgot,\" said Harry. \"You'd better get straight on the train, all of you, you've only got a few minutes to go,\" said Mrs. Weasley, consulting her watch. \"Well, have a lovely term, Ron...\" \"Mr. Weasley, can I have a quick word?\" said Harry, making up his mind on the spur of the moment. \"Of course,\" said Mr. Weasley, who looked slightly surprised, but followed Harry out of earshot of the others nevertheless. Harry had thought it through carefully and come to the conclusion that, if he was to tell anyone, Mr. Weasley was the right person; firstly, because he worked at the Ministry and was therefore in the best position to make further investigations, and secondly, because he thought that there was not too much risk of Mr. Weasley exploding with anger. He could see Mrs. Weasley and the grim-faced Auror casting the pair of them suspicious looks as they moved away. \"When we were in Diagon Alley,\" Harry began, but Mr. Weasley forestalled him with a grimace. \"Am I about to discover where you, Ron, and Hermione disappeared to while you were supposed to be in the back room of Fred and George's shop?\" \"How did you...?\" \"Harry, please. You're talking to the man who raised Fred and George.\" \"Er... yeah, all right, we weren't in the back room.\" \"Very well, then, let's hear the worst.\" \"Well, we followed Draco Malfoy. We used my Invisibility Cloak.\" \"Did you have any particular reason for doing so, or was it a mere whim?\" \"Because I thought Malfoy was up to something,\" said Harry, disregarding Mr. Weasley's look of mingled exasperation and amusement. \"He'd given his mother the slip and I wanted to know why.\" \"Of course you did,\" said Mr. Weasley, sounding resigned. \"Well? Did you find out why?\" \"He went into Borgin and Burkes,\" said Harry, \"and started bullying the bloke in there, Borgin, to help him fix something. And he said he wanted Borgin to keep something else for him. He made it sound like it was the same kind of thing that needed fixing. Like they were a pair. And...\" Harry took a deep breath. \"There's something else. We saw Malfoy jump about a mile when Madam Malkin tried to touch his left arm. I think he's been branded with the Dark Mark. 1 think he's replaced his father as a Death Eater.\" Mr. Weasley looked taken aback. After a moment he said, \"Harry, I doubt whether You-Know-Who would allow a sixteen-year-old...\" \"Does anyone really know what You-Know-Who would or wouldn't do?\" asked Harry angrily. \"Mr. Weasley, I'm sorry, but isn't it worth investigating? If Malfoy wants something fixing, and he needs to threaten Borgin to get it done, it's probably something Dark or dangerous, isn't it?\" \"I doubt it, to be honest, Harry,\" said Mr. Weasley slowly. \"You see, when Lucius Malfoy was arrested, we raided his house. We took away everything that might have been dangerous.\" \"I think you missed something,\" said Harry stubbornly. \"Well, maybe,\" said Mr. Weasley, but Harry could tell that Mr. Weasley was humoring him. There was a whistle behind them; nearly everyone had boarded the train and the doors were closing. \"You'd better hurry!' said Mr. Weasley, as Mrs. Weasley cried, \"Harry, quickly!\" He hurried forward and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley helped him load his trunk onto the train. \"Now, dear, you're coming to us for Christmas, it's all fixed with Dumbledore, so we'll see you quite soon,\" said Mrs. Weasley through the window, as Harry slammed the door shut behind him and the train began to move. \"You make sure you look after yourself and...\" The train was gathering speed. \"...be good and...\" , She was jogging to keep up now. \"...stay safe!\" Harry waved until the train had turned a corner and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were lost to view, then turned to see where the others had got to. He supposed Ron and Hermione were cloistered in the prefects' carriage, but Ginny was a little way along the corridor, chatting to some friends. He made his way toward her, dragging his trunk. People stared shamelessly as he approached. They even pressed their faces against the windows of their compartments to get a look at him. He had expected an upswing in the amount of gaping and gawping he would have to endure this term after all the \"Chosen One\" rumors in the Daily Prophet, but he did not enjoy the sensation of standing in a very bright spotlight. He tapped Ginny on the shoulder. \"Fancy trying to find a compartment?\" \"I can't, Harry, I said I'd meet Dean,\" said Ginny brightly. \"See you later.\" \"Right,\" said Harry. He felt a strange twinge of annoyance as she walked away, her long red hair dancing behind her; he had become so used to her presence over the summer that he had almost forgotten that Ginny did not hang around with him, Ron, and Hermione while at school. Then he blinked and looked around: He was surrounded by mesmerized girls. \"Hi, Harry!\" said a familiar voice from behind him. \"Neville!\" said Harry in relief, turning to see a round-faced boy struggling toward him. \"Hello, Harry,\" said a girl with long hair and large misty eyes, who was just behind Neville. \"Luna, hi, how are you?\" \"Very well, thank you,\" said Luna. She was clutching a magazine to her chest; large letters on the front announced that there was a pair of free Spectrespecs inside. \"Quibbler still going strong, then?\" asked Harry, who felt a certain fondness for the magazine, having given it an exclusive interview the previous year. \"Oh yes, circulation's well up,\" said Luna happily. \"Let's find seats,\" said Harry, and the three of them set off along the train through hordes of silently staring students. At last they found an empty compartment, and Harry hurried inside gratefully. \"They're even staring at us? said Neville, indicating himself and Luna. \"Because we're with you!\" \"They're staring at you because you were at the Ministry too,\" said Harry, as he hoisted his trunk into the luggage rack. \"Our little adventure there was all over the Daily Prophet, you must've seen it.\" \"Yes, I thought Gran would be angry about all the publicity,\" said Neville, \"but she was really pleased. Says I'm starting to live up to my dad at long last. She bought me a new wand, look!\" He pulled it out and showed it to Harry. \"Cherry and unicorn hair,\" he said proudly. \"We think it was one of the last Ollivander ever sold, he vanished next day ... oi, come back here, Trevor!\" And he dived under the seat to retrieve his toad as it made one of its frequent bids for freedom. \"Are we still doing D.A. meetings this year, Harry?\" asked Luna, who was detaching a pair of psychedelic spectacles from the middle of The Quibbler. \"No point now we've got rid of Umbridge, is there?\" said Harry, sitting down. Neville bumped his head against the seat as he emerged from under it. He looked most disappointed. \"I liked the D.A.! I learned loads with you!\" \"I enjoyed the meetings too,\" said Luna serenely. \"It was like having friends.\" This was one of those uncomfortable things Luna often said and which made Harry feel a squirming mixture of pity and embarrassment. Before he could respond, however, there was a disturbance outside their compartment door; a group of fourth-year girls was whispering and giggling together on the other side of the glass. \"You ask him!\" No, you! \"I'll do it!\" And one of them, a bold-looking girl with large dark eyes, a prominent chin, and long black hair pushed her way through the door. \"Hi, Harry, I'm Romilda, Romilda Vane,\" she said loudly and confidently. \"Why don't you join us in our compartment? You don't have to sit with them,\" she added in a stage whisper, indicating Neville's bottom, which was sticking out from under the seat again as he groped around for Trevor, and Luna, who was now wearing her free Spectrespecs, which gave her the look of a demented, multicolored owl. \"They're friends of mine,\" said Harry coldly. \"Oh,\" said the girl, looking very surprised. \"Oh. Okay.\" And she withdrew, sliding the door closed behind her. \"People expect you 10 have cooler friends than us,\" said Luna, once again displaying her knack for embarrassing honesty. \"You are cool,\" said Harry shortly. \"None of them was at the Ministry. They didn't fight with me.\" \"That's a very nice thing to say,\" beamed Luna. Then she pushed her Spectrespecs farther up her nose and settled down to read The Quibbler. \"We didn't face him, though,\" said Neville, emerging from under the seat with fluff and dust in his hair and a resigned-looking Trevor in his hand. \"You did. You should hear my gran talk about you. 'That Harry Potter's got more backbone than the whole Ministry of Magic put together!' She'd give anything to have you as a grand-son... Harry laughed uncomfortably and changed the subject to OWL. results as soon as he could. While Neville recited his grades and wondered aloud whether he would be allowed to take a Transfiguration NEWT, with only an \"Acceptable,\" Harry watched him without really listening. Neville's childhood had been blighted by Voldemort just as much as Harry's had, but Neville had no idea how close he had come to having Harry's destiny. The prophecy could have referred to either of them, yet, for his own inscrutable reasons, Voldemort had chosen to believe that Harry was the one meant. Had Voldemort chosen Neville, it would be Neville sitting opposite Harry bearing the lightning-shaped scar and the weight of the prophecy... Or would it? Would Neville’s mother have died to save him, as Lily had died for Harry? Surely she would... But what if she had been unable to stand between her son and Voldemort? Would there then have been no \"Chosen One\" at all? An empty seat where Neville now sat and a scarless Harry who would have been kissed good-bye by his own mother, not Ron's? \"You all right, Harry? You look funny,\" said Neville. Harry started. \"Sorry ... I ...\" \"Wrackspurt got you?\" asked Luna sympathetically, peering at Harry through her enormous colored spectacles. \"I... what?\" \"A Wrackspurt... They're invisible. They float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy,\" she said. \"I thought I felt one zooming around in here.\" She flapped her hands at thin air, as though beating off large invisible moths. Harry and Neville caught each other's eyes and hastily began to talk of Quidditch. The weather beyond the train windows was as patchy as it had been all summer; they passed through stretches of the chilling mist, then out into weak, clear sunlight. It was during one of the clear spells, when the sun was visible almost directly overhead, that Ron and Hermione entered the compartment at last. \"Wish the lunch trolley would hurry up, I'm starving,\" said Ron longingly, slumping into the seat beside Harry and rubbing his stomach. \"Hi, Neville. Hi, Luna. Guess what?\" he added, turning to Harry. \"Malfoy s not doing prefect duty. He's just sitting in his compartment with the other Slytherins, we saw him when we passed.\" Harry sat up straight, interested. It was not like Malfoy to pass up the chance to demonstrate his power as prefect, which he had happily abused all the previous year. \"What did he do when he saw you?\" \"The usual,\" said Ron indifferently, demonstrating a rude hand gesture. \"Not like him, though, is it? Well... that is\" -- he did the hand gesture again -- \"but why isn't he out there bullying first years? \"Dunno,\" said Harry, but his mind was racing. Didn't this look as though Malfoy had more important things on his mind than bullying younger students? \"Maybe he preferred the Inquisitorial Squad,\" said Hermione. \"Maybe being a prefect seems a bit tame after that.\" \"I don't think so,\" said Harry. \"I think he's ...\" But before he could expound on his theory, the compartment door slid open again and a breathless third-year girl stepped inside. \"I'm supposed to deliver these to Neville Longbottom and Harry P-Potter,\" she faltered, as her eyes met Harry's and she turned scarlet. She was holding out two scrolls of parchment tied with violet ribbon. Perplexed, Harry and Neville took the scroll addressed to each of them and the girl stumbled back out of the compartment. \"What is it?\" Ron demanded, as Harry unrolled his. \"An invitation,\" said Harry. Harry, I would be delighted if you would join me for a bite of lunch in compartment C. Sincerely, Horace \"But what does he want me for?\" asked Neville nervously, as though he was expecting detention. \"No idea,\" said Harry, which was not entirely true, though he had no proof yet that his hunch was correct. \"Listen,\" he added, seized by a sudden brain wave, \"let's go under the Invisibility Cloak, then we might get a good look at Malfoy on the way, see what he's up to.\" This idea, however, came to nothing: The corridors, which were packed with people on the lookout for the lunch trolley, were impossible to negotiate while wearing the cloak. Harry stowed it regretfully back in his bag, reflecting that it would have been nice to wear it just to avoid all the staring, which seemed to have increased in intensity even since he had last walked down the train. Every now and then, students would hurtle out of their compartments to get a better look at him. The exception was Cho Chang, who darted into her compartment when she saw Harry coming. As Harry passed the window, he saw her deep in determined conversation with her friend Marietta, who was wearing a very thick layer of makeup that did not entirely obscure the odd formation of pimples still etched across her face. Smirking slightly, Harry pushed on. When they reached compartment C, they saw at once that they were not Slughorn's only invitees, although judging by the enthusiasm of Slughorn's welcome, Harry was the most warmly anticipated. \"Harry, m'boy!\" said Slughorn, jumping up at the sight of him so that his great velvet-covered belly seemed to fill all the remaining space in the compartment. His shiny bald head and great silvery mustache gleamed as brightly in the sunlight as the golden buttons on his waistcoat. \"Good to see you, good to see you! And you must be Mr. Longbottom!\" Neville nodded, looking scared. At a gesture from Slughorn, they sat down opposite each other in the only two empty seats, which were nearest the door. Harry glanced around at their fellow guests. He recognized a Slytherin from their year, a tall black boy with high cheekbones and long, slanting eyes; there were also two seventh-year boys Harry did not know and, squashed in the corner beside Slughorn and looking as though she was not entirely sure how she had got there, Ginny. \"Now, do you know everyone?\" Slughorn asked Harry and Neville. \"Blaise Zabini is in your year, of course --\" Zabini did not make any sign of recognition or greeting, nor did Harry or Neville: Gryffindor and Slytherin students loathed each other on principle. \"This is Cormac McLaggen, perhaps you've come across each other ... ? No?\" McLaggen, a large, wiry-haired youth, raised a hand, and Harry and Neville nodded back at him. \"... and this is Marcus Belby, I don't know whether ...?\" Belby, who was thin and nervous-looking, gave a strained smile. \"... and this charming young lady tells me she knows you!\" Slughorn finished. Ginny grimaced at Harry and Neville from behind Slughorn's back. \"Well now, this is most pleasant,\" said Slughorn cozily. \"A chance to get to know you all a little better. Here, take a napkin. I've packed my own lunch; the trolley, as I remember it, is heavy on licorice wands, and a poor old man's digestive system isn't quite up to such things... Pheasant, Belby?\" Belby started and accepted what looked like half a cold pheasant. \"I was just telling young Marcus here that I had the pleasure of teaching his Uncle Damocles,\" Slughorn told Harry and Neville, now passing around a basket of rolls. \"Outstanding wizard, outstanding, and his Order of Merlin most well-deserved. Do you see much of your uncle, Marcus?\" Unfortunately, Beiby had just taken a large mouthful of pheasant; in his haste to answer Slughorn he swallowed too fast, turned purple, and began to choke. \"Anapneo,\" said Slughorn calmly, pointing his wand at Belby, whose airway seemed to clear at once. \"Not... not much of him, no,\" gasped Belby, his eyes streaming. \"Well, of course, I daresay he's busy,\" said Slughorn, looking questioningly at Belby. \"I doubt he invented the Wolfsbane Potion without considerable hard work!\" \"I suppose...\" said Belby, who seemed afraid to take another bite of pheasant until he was sure that Slughorn had finished with him. \"Er... he and my dad don't get on very well, you see, so I don't really know much about...\" His voice tailed away as Slughorn gave him a cold smile and turned to McLaggen instead. \"Now, you, Cormac,\" said Slughorn, \"I happen to know you see a lot of your Uncle Tiberius, because he has a rather splendid picture of the two of you hunting nogtails in, I think, Norfolk?\" \"Oh, yeah, that was fun, that was,\" said McLaggen. \"We went with Bertie Higgs and Rufus Scrimgeour; this was before he became Minister, obviously ...\" \"Ah, you know Bertie and Rufus too?\" beamed Slughorn, now offering around a small tray of pies; somehow, Belby was missed out. \"Now tell me...\" It was as Harry had suspected. Everyone here seemed to have been invited because they were connected to somebody well-known or influential... everyone except Ginny. Zabini, who was interrogated after McLaggen, turned out to have a famously beautiful witch for a mother (from what Harry could make out, she had been married seven times, each of her husbands dying mysteriously and leaving her mounds of gold). It was Neville's turn next: This was a very uncomfortable ten minutes, for Neville's parents, well-known Aurors, had been tortured into insanity by Bellatrix Lestrange and a couple of Death Eater cronies. At the end of Neville's interview, Harry had the impression that Slughorn was reserving judgment on Neville, yet to see whether he had any of his parents' flair. \"And now,\" said Slughorn, shifting massively in his seat with the air of a compere introducing his star act. \"Harry Potter! Where to begin? I feel I barely scratched the surface when we met over the summer!\" He contemplated Harry for a moment as though he was a particularly large and succulent piece of pheasant, then said, \"'The Chosen One,' they're calling you now!\" Harry said nothing. Belby, McLaggen, and Zabini were all staring at him. \"Of course,\" said Slughorn, watching Harry closely, \"there have been rumors for years... I remember when ... well ... after that terrible night ... Lily ... James ... and you survived ... and the word was that you must have powers beyond the ordinary ...\" Zabini gave a tiny little cough that was clearly supposed to indicate amused skepticism. An angry voice burst out from behind Slughorn. \"Yeah, Zabini, because you're so talented... at posing...\" \"Oh dear!\" chuckled Slughorn comfortably, looking around at Ginny, who was glaring at Zabini around Slughorn's great belly. \"You want to be careful, Blaise! I saw this young lady perform the most marvelous Bat-Bogey Hex as I was passing her carriage! I wouldn't cross her!\" Zabini merely looked contemptuous. \"Anyway,\" said Slughorn, turning back to Harry. \"Such rumors this summer. Of course, one doesn't know what to believe, the Prophet has been known to print inaccuracies, make mistakes ... but there seems little doubt, given the number of witnesses, that there was quite a disturbance at the Ministry and that you were there in the thick of it all!\" Harry, who could not see any way out of this without flatly lying, nodded but still said nothing. Slughorn beamed at him. \"So modest, so modest, no wonder Dumbledore is so fond ... you were there, then? But the rest of the stories ... so sensational, of course, one doesn't know quite what to believe ... this fabled prophecy, for instance ...\" \"We never heard a prophecy,\" said Neville, turning geranium pink as he said it. \"That's right,\" said Ginny staunchly. \"Neville and I were both there too, and all this 'Chosen One' rubbish is just the Prophet making things up as usual.\" \"You were both there too, were you?\" said Slughorn with great interest, looking from Ginny to Neville, but both of them sat clam-like before his encouraging smile. \"Yes... well... it is true that the Prophet often exaggerates, of course...\" Slughorn said, sounding a little disappointed. \"I remember dear Gwenog telling me (Gwenog Jones, I mean, of course, Captain of the Holyhead Harpies) ...\" He meandered off into a long-winded reminiscence, but Harry had the distinct impression that Slughorn had not finished with him, and that he had not been convinced by Neville and Ginny. The afternoon wore on with more anecdotes about illustrious wizards Slughorn had taught, all of whom had been delighted to join what he called the \"Slug Club\" at Hogwarts. Harry could not wait to leave, but couldn't see how to do so politely. Finally the train emerged from yet another long misty stretch into a red sunset, and Slughorn looked around, blinking in the twilight. \"Good gracious, it's getting dark already! I didn't notice that they'd lit the lamps! You'd better go and change into your robes, all of you. McLaggen, you must drop by and borrow that book on nogtails. Harry, Blaise ... any time you're passing. Same goes for you, miss,\" he twinkled at Ginny. \"Well, off you go, off you go!\" As he pushed past Harry into the darkening corridor, Zabini shot him a filthy look that Harry returned with interest. He, Ginny, and Neville followed Zabini back along the train. \"I'm glad that's over,\" muttered Neville. \"Strange man, isn't he?\" \"Yeah, he is a bit,\" said Harry, his eyes on Zabini. \"How come you ended up in there, Ginny?\" \"He saw me hex Zacharias Smith,\" said Ginny. \"You remember that idiot from Hufflepuff who was in the D.A.? He kept on and on asking about what happened at the Ministry and in the end he annoyed me so much I hexed him ... when Slughorn came in I thought I was going to got detention, but he just thought it was ;i really good hex and invited me to lunch! Mad, eh?\" \"Better reason for inviting someone than because their mother's famous,\" said Harry, scowling at the back of Zabini's head, \"or because their uncle...\" But he broke off. An idea had just occurred to him, a reckless but potentially wonderful idea... In a minute's time, Zabini was going to reenter the Slytherin sixth-year compartment and Malfoy would be sitting there, thinking himself unheard by anybody except fellow Slytherins... If Harry could only enter, unseen, behind him, what might he not see or hear? True, there was little of the journey left ... Hogsmeade Station had to be less than half an hour away, judging by the wildness of the scenery flashing by the windows ... but nobody else seemed prepared to take Harry's suspicions seriously, so it was down to him to prove them. \"I'll see you two later,\" said Harry under his breath, pulling out his Invisibility Cloak and flinging it over himself. \"But what're you ... ?\" asked Neville. \"Later!\" whispered Harry, darting after Zabini as quietly as possible, though the rattling of the train made such caution almost pointless. The corridors were almost completely empty now. Nearly everyone had returned to their carriages to change into their school robes and pack up their possessions. Though he was as close as he could get to Zabini without touching him, Harry was not quick enough to slip into the compartment when Zabini opened the door. Zabini was already sliding it shut when Harry hastily stuck out his foot to prevent it closing. \"What's wrong with this thing?\" said Zabini angrily as he smashed the sliding door repeatedly into Harry's foot. Harry seized the door and pushed it open, hard; Zabini, still clinging on to the handle, toppled over sideways into Gregory Goyle's lap, and in the ensuing ruckus, Harry darted into the compartment, leapt onto Zabini's temporarily empty seat, and hoisted himself up into the luggage rack. It was fortunate that Goyle and Zabini were snarling at each other, drawing all eyes onto them, for Harry was quite sure his feet and ankles had been revealed as the cloak had flapped around them; indeed, for one horrible moment he thought he saw Malfoy's eyes follow his trainer as it whipped upward out of sight. But then Goyle slammed the door shut and flung Zabini off him; Zabini collapsed into his own seat looking ruffled, Vincent Crabbe returned to his comic, and Malfoy, sniggering, lay back down across two seats with his head in Pansy Parkinsons lap. Harry lay curled uncomfortably under the cloak to ensure that every inch of him remained hidden, and watched Pansy stroke the sleek blond hair off Malfoy's forehead, smirking as she did so, as though anyone would have loved to have been in her place. The lanterns swinging from the carriage ceiling cast a bright light over the scene: Harry could read every word of Crabbe's comic directly below him. \"So, Zabini,\" said Malfoy, \"what did Slughorn want?\" \"Just trying to make up to well-connected people,\" said Zabini, who was still glowering at Goyle. \"Not that he managed to find many.\" This information did not seem to please Malfoy. \"Who else had he invited?\" he demanded. \"McLaggen from Gryffindor,\" said Zabini. \"Oh yeah, his uncle's big in the Ministry,\" said Malfoy. \"... someone else called Belby, from Ravenclaw ...\" \"Not him, he's a prat!\" said Pansy. \"... and Longbottom, Potter, and that Weasley girl,\" finished Zabini. Malfoy sat up very suddenly, knocking Pansy's hand aside. \"He invited Longbottom?.\" \"Well, I assume so, as Longbottom was there,\" said Zabini indifferently. \"What's Longbottom got to interest Slughorn?\" Zabini shrugged. \"Potter, precious Potter, obviously he wanted a look at 'the Chosen One,'\" sneered Malfoy, \"but that Weasley girl! What's so special about her?\" \"A lot of boys like her,\" said Pansy, watching Malfoy out of the corner of her eyes for his reaction. \"Even you think she's good-looking, don't you, Blaise, and we all know how hard you are to please! \"I wouldn't touch a filthy little blood traitor like her whatever she looked like,\" said Zabini coldly, and Pansy looked pleased. Malfoy sank back across her lap and allowed her to resume the stroking of his hair. \"Well, I pity Slughorn's taste. Maybe he's going a bit senile. Shame, my father always said he was a good wizard in his day. My father used to be a bit of a favorite of his. Slughorn probably hasn't heard I'm on the train, or...\" \"I wouldn't bank on an invitation,\" said Zabini. \"He asked me about Notts father when I first arrived. They used to be old friends, apparently, but when he heard he'd been caught at the Ministry he didn't look happy, and Nott didn't get an invitation, did he? 1 don't think Slughorn's interested in Death Eaters.\" Malfoy looked angry, but forced out a singularly humorless laugh. \"Well, who cares what he's interested in? What is he, when you come down to it? Just some stupid teacher.\" Malfoy yawned ostentatiously. \"I mean, I might not even be at Hogwarts next year, what's it matter to me if some fat old has-been likes me or not?\" \"What do you mean, you might not be at Hogwarts next year?\" said Pansy indignantly, ceasing grooming Malfoy at once. \"Well, you never know,\" said Malfoy with the ghost of a smirk. \"I might have ... er ... moved on to bigger and better things.\" Crouched in the luggage rack under his cloak, Harry's heart began to race. What would Ron and Hermione say about this? Crabbe and Goyle were gawping at Malfoy; apparently they had had no inkling of any plans to move on to bigger and better things. Even Zabini had allowed a look of curiosity to mar his haughty features. Pansy resumed the slow stroking of Malfoy s hair, looking dumbfounded. \"Do you mean...\" Malfoy shrugged. \"Mother wants me to complete my education, but personally, I don't see it as that important these days. I mean, think about it... When the Dark Lord takes over, is he going to care how many OWLs or N.E.W.T.S anyone's got? Of course he isn't. It'll be all about the kind of service he received, the level of devotion he was shown.\" \"And you think you'll be able to do something for him?\" asked Zabini scathingly. \"Sixteen years old and noi even fully qualified yet?\" \"I've just said, haven't I? Maybe he doesn't care if I'm qualified. Maybe the job he wants me to do isn't something that you need to be qualified for,\" said Malfoy quietly. Crabbe and Goyle were both sitting with their mouths open like gargoyles. Pansy was gazing down at Malfoy as though she had never seen anything so awe-inspiring. \"I can see Hogwarts,\" said Malfoy, clearly relishing the effect he had created as he pointed out of the blackened window. \"We'd better get our robes on.\" Harry was so busy staring at Malfoy, he did not notice Goyle reaching up for his trunk; as he swung it down, it hit Harry hard on the side of the head. He let out an involuntary gasp of pain, and Malfoy looked up at the luggage rack, frowning. Harry was not afraid of Malfoy, but he still did not much like the idea of being discovered hiding under his Invisibility Cloak by a group of unfriendly Slytherins. Eyes still watering and head still throbbing, he drew his wand, careful not to disarrange the cloak, and waited, breath held. To his relief, Malfoy seemed to decide that he had imagined the noise; he pulled on his robes like the others, locked his trunk, and as the train slowed to a jerky crawl, fastened a thick new traveling cloak round his neck. Harry could see the corridors filling up again and hoped that Hermione and Ron would take his things out onto the platform for him; he was stuck where he was until the compartment had quite emptied. At last, with a final lurch, the train came to a complete halt. Goyle threw the door open and muscled his way out into a crowd of second years, punching them aside; Crabbe and Zabini followed. \"You go on,\" Malfoy told Pansy, who was waiting for him with her hand held out as though hoping he would hold it. \"I just want to check something.\" Pansy left. Now Harry and Malfoy were alone in the compartment. People were filing past, descending onto the dark platform. Malfoy moved over to the compartment door and let down the blinds, so that people in the corridor beyond could not peer in. He then bent down over his trunk and opened it again. Harry peered down over the edge of the luggage rack, his heart pumping a little faster. What had Malfoy wanted to hide from Pansy? Was he about to see the mysterious broken object it was so important to mend? \"Petrificus Totalus!\" Without warning, Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry, who was instantly paralyzed. As though in slow motion, he toppled out of the luggage rack and fell, with an agonizing, floor-shaking crash, at Malfoy's feet, the Invisibility Cloak trapped beneath him, his whole body revealed with his legs still curled absurdly into the cramped kneeling position. He couldn't move a muscle; he could only gaze up at Malfoy, who smiled broadly. \"I thought so,\" he said jubilantly. \"I heard Goyle's trunk hit you. And I thought I saw something white flash through the air after Zabini came back...\" His eyes lingered for a moment upon Harry's trainers. \"You didn't hear anything I care about, Potter. But while I've got you here...\" And he stamped, hard, on Harry's face. Harry felt his nose break; blood spurted everywhere. \"That's from my father. Now, let's see...\" Malfoy dragged the cloak out from under Harry's immobilized body and threw it over him. \"I don't reckon they'll find you till the trains back in London,\" he said quietly. \"See you around, Potter... or not.\" And taking care to tread on Harry's fingers, Malfoy left the compartment. \n",

            " EIGHTEEN MOONY, WORMTAIL, PADDFOOT, AND PRONGS It took a few seconds for the absurdity of this statement to sink in. Then Ron voiced what Harry was thinking. \"You're both mental.\" \"Ridiculous!\" said Hermione faintly. \"Peter Pettigrew's dead!\" said Harry. \"He killed him twelve years ago!\" He pointed at Black, whose face twitched convulsively. \"I meant to,\" he growled, his yellow teeth bared, \"but little Peter got the better of me... not this time, though!\" And Crookshanks was thrown to the floor as Black lunged at Scabbers; Ron yelled with pain as Black's weight fell on his broken leg. .\"Sirius, NO!\" Lupin yelled, launching himself forwards and dragging Black away from Ron again, \"WAIT! You can't do it just like that -- they need to understand -- we've got to explain --\" \"We can explain afterwards!\" snarled Black, trying to throw Lupin off. One hand was still clawing the air as it tried to reach Scabbers, who was squealing like a piglet, scratching Ron's face and neck as he tried to escape. \"They've -- got -- a -- right -- to -- know -- -everything!\" Lupin panted, still trying to restrain Black. \"Ron's kept him as a pet! There are parts of it even I don't understand, and Harry -- you owe Harry the truth, Sirius!\" Black stopped struggling, though his hollowed eyes were still fixed on Scabbers, who was clamped tightly under Ron's bitten, scratched, ad bleeding hands. \"All right, then,\" Black said, without taking his eyes off the rat. \"Tell them whatever you like. But make it quick, Remus. I want to commit the murder I was imprisoned for...\" \"You're nutters, both of you,\" said Ron shakily, looking round at Harry and Hermione for support. \"I've had enough of this. I'm off.\" He tried to heave himself up on his good leg, but Lupin raised his wand again, pointing it at Scabbers. \"You're going to hear me out, Ron,\" he said quietly. \"Just keep a tight hold on Peter while you listen.\" \"HE'S NOT PETER, HE'S SCABBERS!\" Ron yelled, trying to fore the rat back into his front pocket, but Scabbers was fighting to hard; Ron swayed and overbalanced, and Harry caught him am pushed him back down to the bed. Then, ignoring Black, Harry turned to Lupin. There were witnesses who saw Pettigrew die,\" he said. \"A whole street full of them...\" \"They didn't see what they thought they saw!\" said Black savagely, still watching Scabbers struggling in Ron's hands. \"Everyone thought Sirius killed Peter,\" said Lupin, nodding. \"I believed it myself -- until I saw the map tonight. Because the Marauder's map never lies... Peter's alive. Ron's holding him, Harry.\" Harry looked down at Ron, and as their eyes met, they agreed, silently: Black and Lupin were both out of their minds. Their story made no sense whatsoever. How could Scabbers be Peter Pettigrew? Azkaban must have unhinged Black after all -- but why was Lupin playing along with him? Then Hermione spoke, in a trembling, would-be calm sort of voice, as though trying to will Professor Lupin to talk sensibly. \"But Professor Lupin... Scabbers can't be Pettigrew... it just can't be true, you know it can't...\" \"Why can't it be true?\" Lupin said calmly, as though they were in class, and Hermione had simply spotted a problem in an experiment with grindylows. \"Because... because people would know if Peter Pettigrew had been an Animagus. We did Animagi in class with Professor McGonagall. And I looked them up when I did my homework -- the Ministry of Magic keeps tabs on witches and wizards who can become animals; there's a register showing what animal they become, and their markings and things... and I went and looked Professor McGonagall up on the register, and there have been only seven Animagi this century, and Pettigrew's name wasn't on the list.\" Harry had barely had time to marvel inwardly at the effort Hermione put into her homework, when Lupin started to laugh. \"Light again, Hermione!\" he said. \"But the Ministry never knew that here used to be three unregistered Animagi running around Hogwarts.\" \"I you're going to tell them the story, get a move on, Remus,\" said Black, who was still watching Scabbers's every desperate move. \"I've waited twelve years, I'm not going to wait much longer.\" \"All right... but you'll need to help me, Sirius,\" said Lupin, I only know how it began...\" Lupin broke off. There had been a loud creak behind him. The bedroom door had opened of its own accord. All five of them stared at it. Then Lupin strode toward it and looked out into the landing. \"No one there...\" \"This place is haunted!\" said Ron. \"It's not,\" said Lupin, still looking at the door in a puzzled way. \"The Shrieking Shack was never haunted.... The screams and howls the villagers used to hear were made by me.\" He pushed his graying hair out of his eyes, thought for a moment then said, \"That's where all of this starts -- with my becoming a werewolf, None of this could have happened if I hadn't been bitter... and if I hadn't been so foolhardy...\" He looked sober and tired. Ron started to interrupt, but Hermione, said, \"Shh!\" She was watching Lupin very intently. \"I as a very small boy when I received the bite. My parents tried everything, but in those days there was no cure. The potion that Professor Snape has been making for me is a very recent discovery. It makes me safe, you see. As long as I take it in the week, preceding the full moon, I keep my mind when I transform.... I'm able to curl up in my office, a harmless wolf, and wait for the moon to wane again. \"Before the Wolfsbane Potion was discovered, however, I became a fully fledged monster once a month. It seemed impossible that I would be able to come to Hogwarts. Other parents weren't likely to want their children exposed to me. \"But then Dumbledore became Headmaster, and he was sympathetic. He said that as long as we took certain precautions, there was no reason I shouldn't come to school....\" Lupin sighed, and looked directly at Harry. \"I told you, months ago, that the Whomping Willow was planted the year I came to Hogwarts. The truth is that it was planted because I came to Hogwarts. This house\" -- Lupin looked miserably around the room, -- \"the tunnel that leads to it -- they were built for my use. Once a month, I was smuggled out of the castle, into this place, to transform. The tree was placed at the tunnel mouth to stop anyone coming across me while I was dangerous.\" Harry couldn't see where this story was going, but he was listening raptly all the same. The only sound apart from Lupin's voice was Scabbers's frightened squeaking. \"My transformations in those days were -- were terrible. It is very painful to turn into a werewolf. I was separated from humans to bite, so I bit and scratched myself instead. The villagers heard the noise and the screaming and thought they were hearing particularly violent spirits. Dumbledore encouraged the rumor.... Even now, when the house has been silent for years, the villagers don't dare approach it....\" \"But apart from my transformations, I was happier than I had ever been in my life. For the first time ever, I had friends, three great friends. Sirius Black... Peter Pettigrew... and, of course, your father, Harry -- James Potter.\" \"Now, my three friends could hardly fail to notice that I disappeared once a month. I made up all sorts of stories. I told them my mother was ill, and that I had to go home to see her... I was terrified they would desert me the moment they found out what I was. But of course, they, like you, Hermione, worked out the truth....\" \"And they didn't desert me at all. Instead, they did something for me that would make my transformations not only bearable, but the best times of my life. They became Animagi.\" \"My dad too?\" said Harry, astounded. \"Yes, indeed,\" said Lupin. \"It took them the best part of three years to work out how to do it. Your father and Sirius here were the cleverest students in the school, and lucky they were, because the Animagus transformation can go horribly wrong -- one reason the Ministry keeps a close watch on those attempting to do it. Peter needed all the help he could get from James and Sirius. Finally, in our fifth year, they managed it. They could each turn into a different animal at will.\" \"But how did that help you?\" said Hermione, sounding puzzled. \"They couldn't keep me company as humans, so they kept me company as animals,\" said Lupin. \"A werewolf is only a danger to people. They sneaked out of the castle every month under James's Invisibility Cloak. They transformed... Peter, as the smallest, could slip beneath the Willow's attacking branches and touch the knot that freezes it. They would then slip down the tunnel and join me. Under their influence, I became less dangerous. My body was still wolfish, but my mind seemed to become less so while I was with them.\" \"Hurry up, Remus,\" snarled Black, who was still watching Scabbers with a horrible sort of hunger on his face. \"I'm getting there, Sirius, I'm getting there... well, highly exciting possibilities were open to us now that we could all transform. Soon we were leaving the Shrieking Shack and roaming the school grounds and the village by night. Sirius and James transformed into such large animals, they were able to keep a werewolf in check. I doubt whether any Hogwarts students ever found out more about the Hogwarts grounds and Hogsmeade than we did.... And that's how we came to write the Marauder's Map, and sign it with our nicknames. Sirius is Padfoot. Peter is Wormtail. James was Prongs.\" \"What sort of animal --?\" Harry began, but Hermione cut him off. \"That was still really dangerous! Running around in the dark with a werewolf! What if you'd given the others the slip, and bitten somebody?\" \"A thought that still haunts me,\" said Lupin heavily. \"And there were near misses, many of them. We laughed about them afterwards. We were young, thoughtless -- carried away with our own cleverness.\" I sometimes felt guilty about betraying Dumbledore's trust, of course... he had admitted me to Hogwarts when no other headmaster would have done so, and he had no idea I was breaking the rules he had set down for my own and others' safety. He never knew I had led three fellow students into becoming Animagi illegally. But I always managed to forget my guilty feelings every time we sat down to plan our next month's adventure. And I haven't changed...\" Lupin's face had hardened, and there was self-disgust in his voice. \"All this year, I have been battling with myself, wondering whether I should tell Dumbledore that Sirius was an Animagus. But I didn't do it. Why? Because I was too cowardly. It would have meant admitting that I'd betrayed his trust while I was at school, admitting that I'd led others along with me... and Dumbledore's trust has meant everything to me. He let me into Hogwarts as a boy, and he gave me a job when I have been shunned all my adult life, unable to find paid work because of what I am. And so I convinced myself that Sirius was getting into the school using dark arts he learned from Voldemort, that being an Animagus had nothing to do with it... so, in a way, Snape's been right about me all along.\" \"Snape?\" said Black harshly, taking his eyes off Scabbers; for the first time in minutes and looking up at Lupin. \"What's Snape got to do with it?\" \"He's here, Sirius,\" said Lupin heavily. \"He's teaching here as well.\" He looked up at Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \"Professor Snape was at school with us. He fought very hard against my appointment to the Defense Against the Dark Arts job. He has been telling Dumbledore A year that I am not to be trusted. He has his reasons... you see, Sirius here played a trick on him which nearly killed him, a trick which involved me --\" Black made a derisive noise. \"It served him right,\" he sneered. \"Sneaking around, trying to find out what we were up to... hoping he could get us expelled....\" \"Severus was very interested in where I went every month.\" Lupin told Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \"We were in the same year, you know, and we -- er -- didn't like each other very much. He especially disliked James. Jealous, I think, of James's talent on the Quidditch field... anyway Snape had seen me crossing the grounds with Madam Pomfrey one evening as she led me toward the Whomping Willow to transform. Sirius thought it would be -- er -- amusing, to tell Snape all he had to do was prod the knot on the tree trunk with a long stick, and he'd be able to get in after me. Well, of course, Snape tried it -- if he'd got as far as this house, he'd have met a fully grown werewolf -- but your father, who'd heard what Sirius had done, went after Snape and pulled him back, at great risk to his life... Snape glimpsed me, though, at the end of the tunnel. He was forbidden by Dumbledore to tell anybody, but from that time on he knew what I was....\" \"So that's why Snape doesn't like you,\" said Harry slowly, \"because he thought you were in on the joke?\" \"That's right,\" sneered a cold voice from the wall behind Lupin. Severus Snape was pulling off the Invisibility Cloak, his wand pointing, directly at Lupin. \n",

            " The Goblin’s Revenge Early next morning, before the other two were awake, Harry left the tent to search the woods around them for the oldest, most gnarled, and resilient-looking tree he could find. There in its shadows he buried Mad-Eye Moody's eye and marked the spot by gouging a small cross in the bark with his wand. It was not much, but Harry felt that Mad-Eye would have much preferred this to being stuck on Dolores Umbridge's door. Then he returned to the tent to wait for the others to wake, and discuss what they were going to do next. Harry and Hermione felt that it was best not to stay anywhere too long, and Ron agreed, wit the sole proviso that their next move took them within reach of a bacon sandwich. Hermione therefore removed the enchantments she had placed around the clearing, while Harry and Ron obliterated all the marks and impressions on the ground that might show they had camped there. Then they Disapparated to the outskirts of a small market town. Once they had pitched the tent in the shelter of a small copse of trees and surrounded it with freshly cast defensive enchantments. Harry ventured out under the Invisibility Cloak to find sustenance. This, however, did not go as planned. He had barely entered the town when an unnatural chill, a descending mist, and a sudden darkening of the skies made him freeze where he stood. \"But you can make a brilliant Patronus!\" protested Ron, when Harry arrived back at the tent empty handed, out of breath, and mouthing the single word, dementors. \"I couldn't . . . make one.\" he panted, clutching the stitch in his side. \"Wouldn't . . . come.\" Their expressions of consternation and disappointment made Harry feel ashamed. It had been a nightmarish experience, seeing the dementors gliding out of the must in the distance and realizing, as the paralyzing cold choked his lungs and a distant screaming filled his ears, that he was not going to be able to protect himself. It had taken all Harry's willpower to uproot himself from the spot and run, leaving the eyeless dementors to glide amongst the Muggles who might not be able to see them, but would assuredly feel the despair they cast wherever they went. \"So we still haven't got any food.\" \"Shut up, Ron,\" snapped Hermione. \"Harry, what happened? Why do you think you couldn't make your Patronus? You managed perfectly yesterday!\" \"I don't know.\" He sat low in one of Perkins's old armchairs, feeling more humiliated by the moment. He was afraid that something had gone wrong inside him. Yesterday seemed a long time ago: Today me might have been thirteen years old again, the only one who collapsed on the Hogwarts Express. Ron kicked a chair leg. \"What?\" he snarled at Hermione. \"I'm starving! All I've had since I bled half to death is a couple of toadstools!\" \"You go and fight your way through the dementors, then,\" said Harry, stung. \"I would, but my arm's in a sling, in case you hadn't noticed!\" \"That's convenient.\" \"And what's that supposed to - ?\" \"Of course!\" cried Hermione, clapping a hand to her forehead and startling both of them into silence. \"Harry, give me the locket! Come on,\" she said impatiently, clicking her fingers at him when he did not react,\" to Horcrux, Harry, you're still wearing it!\" She held out her hands, and Harry lifted the golden chain over his head. The moment it parted contact with Harry's skin he free and oddly light. He had not even realized that he was clammy or that there was a heavy weight pressing on his stomach until both sensations lifted. \"Better?\" asked Hermione. \"Yeah, loads better!\" \"Harry,\" she said, crouching down in front of him and using the kind of voice he associated with visiting the very sick, \"you don't think you've been possessed, do you?\" \"What? No!\" he said defensively, \"I remember everything we've done while I've bee wearing it. I wouldn't know what I'd done if I'd been possessed, would I? Ginny told me there were times when she couldn't remember anything.\" \"Hmm,\" said Hermione, looking down at the heavy locket. \"Well, maybe we ought not to wear it. We can just keep it in the tent.\" \"We are not leaving that Horcrux lying around,\" Harry stated firmly. \"If we lose it, if it gets stolen-\" \"Oh, all right, all right,\" said Hermione, and she placed it around her own neck and tucked it out of sight down the front of her shirt. \"But we'll take turns wearing it, so nobody keeps it on too long.\" \"Great,\" said Ron irritably, \"and now we've sorted that out, can we please get some food?\" \"Fine, but we'll go somewhere else to find it,\" said Hermione with half a glance at Harry. \"There's no point staying where we know dementors are swooping around.\" In the end they settled down for the night in a far flung field belonging to a lonely farm, from which they had managed to obtain eggs and bread. \"It's not stealing, is it?\" asked Hermione in a troubled voice, as they devoured scrambled eggs on toast. \"Not if I left some money under the chicken coo?\" Ron rolled his eyes and said, with his cheeks bulging, \"Er-my-nee, 'oo worry 'oo much. 'Elax!\" And, indeed, it was much easier to relax when they were comfortably well fed. The argument about the dementors was forgotten in laughter that night, and Harry felt cheerful, even hopeful, as he took the first of the three night watches. This was their first encounter with the fact that a full stomach meant good spirits, an empty one, bickering and gloom. Harry was least surprised by this, because be had suffered periods of near starvation at the Dursleys’. Hermione bore up reasonably well on those nights when they managed to scavenge nothing but berries or stale biscuits, her temper perhaps a little shorter than usual and her silences dour. Ron, however, had always been used to three delicious meals a day, courtesy of his mother or of the Hogwarts house-elves, and hunger made him both unreasonable and irascible. Whenever lack of food coincided with Ron's turn to wear the Horcrux, he became downright unpleasant. \"So where next?\" was his constant refrain. He did not seem to have any ideas himself, but expected Harry and Hermione to come up with plans while he sat and brooded over the low food supplies. Accordingly Harry and Hermione spent fruitless hours trying to decide where they might find the other Horcruxes, and how to destroy the one they already got, their conversations becoming increasingly repetitive as they got no new information. As Dumbledore had told Harry that be believed Voldemort had hidden the Horcruxes in places important to him, they kept reciting, in a sort of dreary litany, those locations they knew that Voldemort had lived or visited. The orphanage where he had been born and raised: Hogwarts, where he had been educated; Borgin and Burks, where he had worked after completing school; then Albania, where he had spent his years of exile: These formed the basis of their speculations. \"Yeah, let's go to Albania. Shouldn't take more than an afternoon to search an entire country,\" said Ron sarcastically. \"There can't be anything there. He'd already made five of his Horcruxes before he went into exile, and Dumbledore was certain the snake is the sixth,\" said Hermione. \"We know the snake's not in Albania, it's usually with Vol-\" \"Didn't I ask you to stop say that?\" \"Fine! The snake is usually with You-Know-Who-happy?\" \"Not particularly.\" \"I can't see him hiding anything at Borgin and Burkes.\" said Harry, who had made this point many times before, but said it again simply to break the nasty silence. \"Borgin and Burke were experts at Dark objects, they would've recognized a Horcrux straightaway.\" Ron yawned pointedly. Repressing a strong urge to throw something at him, Harry plowed on, \"I still reckon he might have hidden something at Hogwarts.\" Hermione sighed. \"But Dumbledore would have found it, Harry!\" Harry repeated the argument he kept bringing out in favor of this theory. \"Dumbledore said in front of me that he never assumed he knew all of Hogwart's secrets. I'm telling you, if there was one place Vol-\" \"Oi!\" \"YOU-KNOW-WHO, then!\" Harry shouted, goaded past endurance. \"If there was one place that was really important to You-Know-Who, it was Hogwarts!\" \"Oh, come on,\" scoffed Ron. \"His school?\" \"Yeah, his school! It was his first real home, the place that meant he was special: it meant everything to him, and even after he left-\" \"This is You-Know-Who we're talking about, right? Not you?\" inquired Ron. He was tugging at the chain of the Horcrux around his neck; Harry was visited by a desire to seize it and throttle him. \"You told us that You-Know-Who asked Dumbledore to give him a job after he left,\" said Hermione. \"That's right,\" said Harry. \"And Dumbledore thought he only wanted to come back to try and find something, probably another founder's object, to make into another Horcrux?\" \"Yeah,\" said Harry. \"But he didn’t get the job, did he?\" said Hermione. \"So he never got the chance to find a founder’s object there and hide it in the school!\" \"Okay, then,\" said Harry, defeated. \"Forget Hogwarts.\" Without any other leads, they traveled into London and, hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, search for the orphanage in which Voldemort had been raised. Hermione stole into a library and discovered from their records that the place had been demolished many years before. They visited its site and found a tower block of offices. \"We could try digging in to foundations?\" Hermione suggested halfheartedly. \"He wouldn’t have hidden a Horcrux here,\" Harry said. He had known it all along. The orphanage had been the place Voldemort had been determined to escape; he would never have hidden a part of his soul there. Dumbledore had shown Harry that Voldemort sought grandeur or mystique in his hiding places; this dismal gray corner of London was as far removed as you could imagine from Hogwarts of the Ministry or a building like Gringotts, the Wizarding banks, with its gilded doors and marble floors. Even without any new idea, they continued to move through the countryside, pitching the tent in a different place each night for security. Every morning they made sure that they had removed all clues to their presence, then set off to find another lonely and secluded spot, traveling by Apparition to more woods, to the shadowy crevices of cliffs, to purple moors, gorse-covered mountainsides, and once a sheltered and pebbly cove. Every twelve hours or so they passed the Horcrux between them as though they were playing some perverse, slow-motion game of pass-the-parcel, where they dreaded the music stopping because the reward was twelve hours of increased fear and anxiety. Harry’s scare kept prickling. It happened most often, he noticed, when he was wearing the Horcrux. Sometimes he could not stop himself reacting to the pain. \"What? What did you see?\" demanded Ron, whenever he noticed Harry wince. \"A face,\" muttered Harry, every time. \"The same face. The thief who stole from Gregorovitch.\" And Ron would turn away, making no effort to hide his disappointment. Harry knew that Ron was hoping to bear news of his family or the rest of the Order of the Phoenix, but after all, he, Harry, was not a television aerial; he could only see what Voldemort was thinking at the time, not tune in to whatever took his fancy. Apparently Voldemort was dwelling endlessly on the unknown youth with the gleeful face, whose name and whereabouts, Harry felt sure, Voldemort knew no better than he did. As Harry’s scar continued to burn and the merry, blond-haired boy swam tantalizingly in his memory, he learned to suppress any sign of pain or discomfort, for the other two showed nothing but impatience at the mention of the thief. He could not entirely blame them, when they were so desperate for a lean on the Horcruxes. As the days stretched into weeks, Harry began to suspect that Ron and Hermione were having conversations without, and about, him. Several times they stopped talking abruptly when Harry entered the tent, and twice he came accidentally upon them, huddled a little distance away, heads together and talking fast; both times they fell silent when they realized he was approaching them and hastened to appear busy collecting wood or water. Harry could not help wondering whether they had only agreed to come on what now felt like a pointless and rambling journey because they thought he had some secret plan that they would learn in due course. Ton was making no effort to hide his bad mood, and Harry was starting to fear that Hermione too was disappointed by his poor leadership. In desperation he tried to think of further Horcrux locations, but the only one that continued to occur to him was Hogwarts, and as neither of the others thought this at all likely, he stopped suggesting it. Autumn rolled over the countryside as they moved through it. They were now pitching the tent on mulches of fallen leaves. Natural mists joined those cast by the dementors; wind and rain added to their troubles. The fact that Hermione was getting better at identifying edible fungi could not altogether compensate for their continuing isolation, the lack of other people’s company, or their total ignorance of what was going on in the war against Voldemort. \"My mother,\" said Ron on night, as they sat in the tent on a riverbank in Wales, \"can make good food appear out of thin air.\" He prodded moodily at the lumps of charred gray fish on his plate. Harry glanced automatically at Ron’s neck and saw, as he has expected, the golden chain of the Horcrux glinting there. He managed to fight down the impulse to swear at Ron, whose attitude would, he knew, improve slightly when the time came to take off the locket. \"Your mother can’t produce food out of thin air,\" said Hermione. \"no one can. Food is the first of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp’s Law of Elemental Transfigura-\" \"Oh, speak English, can’t you?\" Ron said, prising a fish out from between his teeth. \"It’s impossible to make good food out of nothing! You can Summon it if you know where it is, you can transform it, you can increase the quantity if you’ve already got some-\" \"Well, don’t bother increasing this, it’s disgusting,\" said Ron. \"Harry caught the fish and I did my best with it! I notice I’m always the one who ends up sorting out the food, because I’m a girl, I suppose!\" \"No, it’s because you’re supposed to be the best at magic!\" shot back Ron. Hermione jumped up and bits of roast pike slid off her tin plate onto the floor. \"You can do the cooking tomorrow, Ron, you can find the ingredients and try and charm them into something worth eating, and I’ll sit here and pull faces and moan and you can see you-\" \"Shut up!,\" said Harry, leaping to his feet and holding up both hands. \"Shut up now!\" Hermione looked outraged. \"How can you side with him, he hardly ever does the cook-\" \"Hermione, be quiet, I can hear someone!\" He was listening hard, his hands still raised, warning them not to talk. Then, over the rush and gush of the dark river beside them, he heard voices again. He looked around at the Sneakoscope. It was not moving. \"You cast the Muffliato charm over us, right?\" he whispered to Hermione. \"I did everything,\" she whispered back, \"Muffliato, Muggle-Repelling and Disillusionment Charms, all of it. They shouldn’t be able to hear of see us, whoever they are.\" Heavy scuffing and scraping noises, plus the sound of dislodged stones and twigs, told them that several people were clambering down the steep, wooded slope that descended to the narrow bank where they had pitched the tent. They drew their wands, waiting. The enchantments they had cast around themselves ought to be sufficient, in the near total darkness, to shield them from the notice of Muggles and normal witches and wizards. If these were Death Eaters, then perhaps their defenses were about to be tested by Dark Magic for the first time. The voices became louder but no more intelligible as the group of men reached the bank. Harry estimated that their owners were fewer than twenty feet away, but the cascading river made it impossible to tell for sure. Hermione snatched up the beaded bag and started to rummage; after a moment she drew out three Extendible Ears and threw one each to Harry and Ron, who hastily inserted the ends of the flesh-colored strings into their ears and fed the other ends out of the tent entrance. Within seconds Harry heard a weary male voice. \"There ought to be a few salmon in here, or d’you reckon it’s too early in the season? Accio Salmon!\" There were several distinct splashes and then the slapping sounds of fish against flesh. Somebody grunted appreciatively. Harry pressed the Extendable ear deeper into his own: Over the murmur of the river he could make out more voices, but they were not speaking English or any human language he had ever heard. It was a rough and unmelodious tongue, a string of rattling, guttural noises, and there seemed to be two speakers, one with a slightly lower, slower voice than the other. A fire danced into life on the other side of the canvas, large shadows passed between tent and flames. The delicious smell of baking salmon wafted tantalizingly in their direction. Then came the clinking of cutlery on plates, and the first man spoke again. \"Here, Griphook, Gornuk.\" Goblins! Hermione mouthed at Harry, who nodded. \"Thank you,\" said the goblins together in English. \"So, you three have been on the run how long?\" asked a new, mellow, and pleasant voice; it was vaguely familiar to Harry, who pictured a round-bellied, cheerful-faced man. \"Six weeks . . . Seven . . . I forget,\" said the tired man. \"Met up with Griphook in the first couple of days and joined forces with Gornuk not long after. Nice to have a but of company.\" There was a pause, while knives scraped plates and tin mugs were picked up and replaced on the ground. \"What made you leave, Ted?\" continued the man. \"Knew they were coming for me,\" replied mellow-voiced Ted, and Harry suddenly knew who he was: Tonks’s father. \"Heard Death Eaters were in the area last week and decided I’d better run for it. Refused to register as a Muggle-born on principle, see, so I knew it was a matter of time, knew I’d have to leave in the end. My wife should be okay, she’s pure-blood. And then I net Dean here, what, a few days ago, son?\" \"Yeah,\" said another voice, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at each other, silent but besides themselves with excitement, sure they recognized the voice of Dean Thomas, their fellow Gryffindor. \"Muggle-born, eh?\" asked the first man. \"Not sure ,\" said Dean. \"My dad left my mum when I was a kid. I’ve got no proof he was a wizard, though.\" There was silence for a while, except for the sounds of munching; then Ted spoke again. \"I’ve got to say, Dirk, I’m surprised to run into you. Pleased, but surprised. Word was that you’d been caught.\" \"I was,\" said Dirk. \"I was halfway to Azkaban when I made a break for it. Stunned Dawlish, and nicked his broom. It was easier than you’d think; I don’t reckon he’s quite right at the moment .Might be Confunded. If so, I’d like to shake the hand of the witch or wizard who did it, probably saved my life.\" There was another pause in which the fire crackled and the river rushed on. The Ted said, \"And where do you two fit in? I, er, had the impression the goblins were for You-Know-Who, on the whole.\" \"You had a false impression,\" said the higher-voiced of the goblins. \"We take no sides. This is a wizards’ war.\" \"How come you’re in hiding, then?\" \"I deemed in prudent,\" said the deeper-voiced goblin. \"Having refused what I considered an impertinent request, I could see that my person safety was in jeopardy.\" \"What did they ask you to do?\" asked Ted. \"Duties ill-befitting the dignity of my race,\" replied the goblin, his voice rougher and less human as he said it. \"I am not a house-elf.\" \"What about you, Griphook?\" \"Similar reasons,\" said the higher voiced goblin. \"Gringotts is no longer under the sole control of my race. I recognize no Wizarding master.\" He added something under his breath in Gobbledegook, and Gornuk laughed. \"What’s the joke?\" asked Dean. \"He said,\" replied Dirk, \"that there are things wizards don’t recognize, either.\" There was a short pause. \"I don’t get it,\" said Dean. \"I had my small revenge before I left,,\" said Griphook in English. \"Good man-goblin, I should say,\" amended Ted hastily. \"Didn’t manage to lock a Death Eater up in one of the old high-security vaults, I suppose?\" \"If I had, the sword would not have helped him break out,\" replied Griphook. Gornuk laughed again and even Dirk gave a dry chuckle. \"Dean and I are still missing something here,\" said Ted. \"So is Severus Snape, though he does not know it,\" said Griphook, and the two goblins roared with malicious laughter. Inside the tent Harry’s breathing was shallow with excitement: He and Hermione stared at each other, listening as hard as they could. \"Didn’t you hear about that, Ted?\" asked Dirk. \"About the kids who tried to steal Gryffindor’s sword out of Snape’s office at Hogwarts?\" An electric current seemed to course through Harry, jangling his every nerve as he stood rooted to the spot. \"Never heard a word,\" said Ted, \"Not in the Prophet, was it?\" \"Hardly,\" chortled Dirk. \"Griphook here told me, he heard about it from Bill Weasley who works for the bank. One of the kids who tried to take the sword was Bill’s younger sister.\" Harry glanced toward Hermione and Ron, both of whom were clutching the Extendable Ears as tightly as lifelines. \"She and a couple of friends got into Snape’s office and smashed open the glass case where he was apparently keeping the sword. Snape caught them as they were trying to smuggle it down the staircase. \"Ah, God bless ‘em,\" said Ted. \"What did they think, that they’d be able to use the sword on You-Know-Who? Or on Snape himself? \"Well, whatever they thought they were going to do with it, Snape decided the sword wasn’t safe where it was,\" said Dirk. \"Couple of days later, once he’d got the say-so from You-Know-Who, I imagine, he sent it down to London to be kept in Gringotts instead.\" The goblins started to laugh again. \"I’m still not seeing the joke,\" said Ted. \"It’s a fake,\" rasped Griphook. \"The sword of Gryffindor!\" \"Oh yes. It is a copy-en excellent copy, it is true-but it was Wizard-made. The original was forged centuries ago by goblins and had certain properties only goblin-made armor possesses. Wherever the genuine sword of Gryffindor is, it is not in a vault at Gringotts bank.\" \"I see,\" said Ted. \"And I take it you didn’t bother telling the Death Eaters this/’ \"I saw no reason to trouble them with the information,\" said Griphook smugly, and now Ted and Dean joined in Gornuk and Dirk’s laughter. Inside the tent, Harry closed his eyes, willing someone to ask the question he needed answered, and after a minute that seemed ten, Dean obliged: he was (Harry remembered with a jolt) an ex-boyfriend of Ginny’s too. \"What happened to Ginny and all the others? The ones who tried to steal it?\" \"Oh, they were punished, and cruelly,\" said Griphook indifferently. \"They’re okay, though?\" asked Ted quickly, \"I mean, the Weasleys don’t need any more of their kids injured, do they?\" \"They suffered no serious injury, as far as I am aware,\" said Griphook. \"Lucky for them,\" said Ted. \"With Snape’s track record I suppose we should just be glad they’re still alive.\" \"You believe that story, then, do you, Ted?\" asked Dirk.\" You believe Snape killed Dumbledore? \"Course I do,\" said Ted. \"You’re not going to sit there and tell me you think Potter had anything to do with it?\" \"Hard to know what to believe these days,\" muttered Dirk. \"I know Harry Potter,\" said Dean. \"And I reckon he’s the real thing-the Chosen One, or whatever you want to call it.\" \"Yeah, there’s a lot would like to believe he’s that, son,\" said Dirk, \"me included. But where is he? Run for it, by the looks of things. You’d think if he knew anything we don’t, or had anything special going for him, he’d be out there now fighting, rallying resistance, instead of hiding. And you know, the Prophet made a pretty good case against him-\" \"The Prophet?\" scoffed Ted. \"You deserve to be lied to if you’re still reading that much, Dirk. You want the facts, try the Quibbler.\" There was a sudden explosion of choking and retching, plus a good deal of thumping, by the sound of it. Dirk had swallowed a fish bone. At last he sputtered, \"The Quibbler? That lunatic rag of Xeno Lovegood’s?\" \"It’s not so lunatic these days,\" said Ted. \"You want to give it a look, Xeno is printing all the stuff the Prophet’s ignoring, not a single mention of Crumple-Horned Snorkacks in the last issue. How long they’ll let him get with it, mind, I don’t know. But Xeno says, front page of every issue, that any wizard who’s against You-Know-Who ought to make helping Harry Potter their number-one priority.\" \"Hard to help a boy who’s vanished off the face of the earth,\" said Dirk. \"Listen, the fact that they haven’t caught him yet’s one hell of an achievement,\" said Ted. \"I’d take tips from him gladly; it’s what we’re trying to do, stay free, isn’t it?\" \"Yeah, well, you’ve got a point there,\" said Dirk heavily. \"With the whole of the Ministry and all their informers looking for him, I’d have expected him to be caught by now. Mind, who’s to say they haven’t already caught and killed him without publicizing it?\" \"Ah, don’t say that, Dirk,\" murmured Ted. There was a long pause filled with more clattering of knives and forks. When they spoke again it was to discuss whether they ought to sleep on the back or retreat back up the wooded slope. Deciding the trees would give better cover, they extinguished their fire, then clambered back up the incline, their voices fading away. Harry, Ron, and Hermione reeled in the Extendable Ears. Harry, who had found the need to remain silent increasingly difficult the longer they eavesdropped, now found himself unable to say more then, \"Ginny-the sword-\" \"I know!\" said Hermione. She lunged for the tiny beaded bag, this time sinking her arm in it right up to the armpit. \"Here . . . we . . . are . . .\" she said between gritted teeth, and she pulled at something that was evidently in the depths of the bag. Slowly the edge of an ornate picture frame came into sight. Harry hurried to help her. As they lifted the empty portrait of Phineas Nigellus free of Hermione’s bag, she kept her wand pointing at it, ready to cast a spell at any moment. \"If somebody swapped the real sword for the face while it was in Dumbledore’s office,\" she panted, as they propped the painting against the side of the tent, \"Phineas Nigellus would have seen it happen, he hangs right beside the case!\" \"Unless he was asleep,\" said Harry, but he still held his breath as Hermione knelt down in front of the empty canvas, her wand directed at its center, cleared her throat, then said: \"Er-Phineas? Phineas Nigellus?\" Nothing happened. \"Phineas Nigellus?\" said Hermione again. \"Professor Black? Please could we talk to you? Please?\" \"’Please’ always helps,\" said a cold, snide voice, and Phineas Nigellus slid into his portrait. At one, Hermione cried: \"Obscura!\" A black blindfold appeared over Phineas Nigellus’s clever, dark eyes, causing him to bump into the frame and shriek with pain. \"What-how dare-what are you-?\" \"I’m very sorry, Professor Black,\" said Hermione, \"but it’s a necessary precaution!\" \"remove this foul addition at once! Remove it, I say! You are ruining a great work of art! Where am I? What is going on?\" \"Never mind where we are,\" said Harry, and Phineas Nigellus froze, abandoning his attempts to peel off the painted blindfold. \"Can that possible be the voice of the elusive Mr. Potter?\" \"Maybe,\" said Harry, knowing that this would keep Phineas Nigellus’s interest. \"We’ve got a couple of questions to ask you-about the sword of Gryffindor.\" \"Ah,\" said Phineas Nigellus, now turning his head this way and that in an effort to catch sight of Harry, \"yes. That silly girl acted most unwisely there-\" \"Shut up about my sister,\" said Ron roughly, Phineas Nigellus raised supercilious eyebrows. \"Who else is here?\" he asked, turning his head from side to side. \"Your tone displeases me! The girl and her friends were foolhardily in the extreme. Thieving from the headmaster.\" \"They weren’t thieving,\" said Harry. \"That sword isn’t Snape’s.\" \"It belongs to Professor Snape’s school,\" said Phineas Nigellus. \"Exactly what claim did the Weasley girl have upon it? She deserved her punishment, as did the idiot Longbottom and the Lovegood oddity!\" \"Neville is not an idiot and Luna is not an oddity!\" said Hermione. \"Where am I?\" repeated Phineas Nigellus, starting to wrestle with the blindfold again. \"Where have you brought me? Why have you removed me from the house of my forebears?\" \"never mind that! How did Snape punish Ginny, Neville, and Luna?\" asked Harry urgently. \"Professor Snape sent them into the Forbidden Forest, to do some work for the oaf, Hagrid.\" \"Hagrid’s not an oaf!\" said Hermione shrilly. \"And Snape might’ve though that was a punishment,\" said Harry, \"buy Ginny, Neville, and Luna probably had a good laugh with Hagrid. The Forbidden Forest . . . they’ve faced plenty worse than the Forbidden Forest, big deal!\" He felt relieved; he had been imagining horrors, the Cruciatus Curse at the very least. \"What we really wanted to know, Professor Black, is whether anyone else has, um, taken out the sword at all? Maybe it’s been taken away for cleaning-or something!\" Phineas Nigellus paused again in his struggles to free his eyes and sniggered. \"Muggle-born,\" he said, \"Goblin-made armor does not require cleaning, simple girl. Goblin’s silver repels mundane dirt, imbibing only that which strengthens it.\" \"Don’t call Hermione simple,\" said Harry. \"I grow weary of contradiction,\" said Phineas Nigellus. \"perhaps it is time for me to return to the headmaster’s office.?\" Still blindfolded, he began groping the side of his frame, trying to feel his way out of his picture and back into the one at Hogwarts. Harry had a sudden inspiration. \"Dumbledore! Can’t you bring us Dumbledore?\" \"I beg your pardon?\" asked Phineas Nigellus. \"Professor Dumbledore’s portrait-couldn’t you bring him along, here, into yours?\" Phineas Nigellus turned his face in the direction of Harry’s voice. \"Evidently it is not only Muggle-borns who are ignorant, Potter. The portraits of Hogwarts may commune with each other, but they cannot travel outside of the castle except to visit a painting of themselves elsewhere. Dumbledore cannot come here with me, and after the treatment I have received at your hands, I can assure you that I will not be making a return visit!\" Slightly crestfallen, Harry watched Phineas redouble his attempts to leave his frame. \"Professor Black,\" said Hermione, \"couldn’t you just tell us, please, when was the last time the sword was taken out of its case? Before Ginny took it out, I mean?\" Phineas snorted impatiently. \"I believe that the last time I saw the sword of Gryffindor leave its case was when Professor Dumbledore used it to break open a ring.\" Hermione whipped around to look at Harry. Neither of them dared say more in front of Phineas Nigellus, who had at least managed to locate the exit. \"Well, good night to you,\" he said a little waspishly, and he began to move out of sight again. Only the edge of his hat brim remained in view when Harry gave a sudden shout. \"Wait! Have you told Snape you saw this?\" Phineas Nigellus stuck his blindfolded head back into the picture. \"Professor Snape has more important things on his mind that the many eccentricities of Albus Dumbledore. Good-bye, Potter!\" And with that, he vanished completely, leaving behind him nothing but his murky backdrop. \"Harry!\" Hermione cried. \"I know!\" Harry shouted. Unable to contain himself, he punched the air; it was more than he had dared to hope for. He strode up and down the tent, feeling that he could have run a mile; he did not even feel hungry anymore. Hermione was squashing Phineas Nigellus’s back into the beaded bag; when she had fastened the clasp she threw the bag aside and raised a shining face to Harry. \"The sword can destroy Horcruxes! Goblin-made blades imbibe only that which strengthens them-Harry, that sword’s impregnated with basilisk venom!\" \"And Dumbledore didn’t five it to me because he still needed it, he wanted to use it on the locket-\" \"-and he must have realized they wouldn’t let you have it if he put it in his will-\" \"-so he made a copy-\" \"-and put a fake in the glass case-\" \"-and he left the real one-where?\" They gazed at east other Harry felt that the answer was dangling invisibly in the air above them, tantalizingly close. Why hadn’t Dumbledore told him? Or had he, in fact, told Harry, but Harry had not realized it at the time?\" \"Think!\" whispered Hermione. \"Think! Where would he have left it?\" \"Not at Hogwarts,\" said Harry, resuming his pacing. \"Somewhere in Hogsmeade?\" suggested Hermione. \"The Shrieking Shack?\" said Harry. \"Nobody ever goes in there.\" \"But Snape knows how to get in, wouldn’t that be a bit risky?\" \"Dumbledore trusted Snape,\" Harry reminded her. \"Not enough to tell him that he had swapped the swords,\" said Hermione. \"Yeah, you’re right!\" said Harry, and he felt even more cheered at the thought that Dumbledore had had some reservations, however faint, about Snape’s trustworthiness. \"So, would he have hidden the sword well away from Hogsmeade, then? What d’you reckon, Ron? Ron?\" Harry looked around. For one bewildered moment he thought that Ron had left the tent, then realized that Ron was lying in the shadow of a bunk, looking stony. \"Oh, remembered me, have you?\" he said. \"What?\" Ron snorted as he stared up at the underside of the upper bunk. \"You two carry on. Don’t let me spoil your fun.\" Perplexed, Harry looked to Hermione for help, but she shook her head, apparently as nonplussed as he was. \"What’s the problem?\" asked Harry. \"Problem? There’s no problem,\" said Ron, still refusing to look at Harry. \"Not according to you, anyways.\" There were several plunks on the canvas over their heads. It had started to rain. \"Well, you’ve obviously got a problem,\" said Harry. \"Spit it out, will you?\" Ron swung his long legs off the bed and sat up. He looked mean, unlike himself. \"All right, I’ll spit it out. Don’t expect me to skip up and down the tent because there’s some other damn thing we’ve got to find. Just add it to the list of stuff you don’t know.\" \"I don’t know?\" repeated Harry. \"I don’t know?\" Plunk, plunk, plunk. The rain was falling harder and heavier; it pattered on the leaf-strewn bank all around them and into the river chattering through the dark. Dread doused Harry’s jubilation; Ron was saying exactly what he had suspected and feared him to be thinking. \"It’s not like I’m not having the time of my life here,\" said Ron, \"you know, with my arm mangled and nothing to eat and freezing my backside off every night. I just hoped, you know, after we’d been running round a few weeks, we’d have achieved something.\" \"Ron,\" Hermione said, but in such a quiet voice that Ron could pretend not to have heard it over the loud tattoo the rain was beating on the tent. \"I thought you knew what you’d signed up for,\" said Harry. \"Yeah, I thought I did too.\" \"So what part of it isn’t living up to your expectations?\" asked Harry. Anger was coming to his defense now. \"Did you think we’d be staying in five-star hotels? Finding a Horcrux every other day? Did you think you’d be back to Mummy by Christmas?\" \"We thought you knew what you were doing!\" shouted Ron, standing up, and his words Harry like scalding knives. \"We thought Dumbledore had told you what to do, we thought you had a real plan!\" \"Ron!\" said Hermione, this time clearly audible over the rain thundering on the tent roof, but again, he ignored her. \"Well, sorry to let you down,\" said Harry, his voice quite calm even though he felt hollow, inadequate. \"I’ve been straight with you from the start. I told you everything Dumbledore told me. And in the case you haven’t noticed, we’ve found one Horcrux-\" \"Yeah, and we’re about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them-nowhere effing near in other words.\" \"take off the locket, Ron,\" Hermione said, her voice unusually high. \"Please take it off. You wouldn’t be talking like this if you hadn’t been wearing it all day.\" \"Yeah, he would,\" said Harry, who did not want excuses made for Ron. \"D’you think I haven’t noticed the two of you whispering behind my back? D’you think I didn’t guess you were thinking this stuff? \"Harry, we weren’t-\" \"Don’t lie!\" Ron hurled at her. \"You said it too, you said you were disappointed, you said you’d thought he had a bit more to go on than-\" \"I didn’t say it like that-Harry, I didn’t!\" she cried. The rain was pounding the tent, tears were pouring down Hermione’s face, and the excitement of a few minutes before had vanished as if it had never been, a short-lived firework that had flared and died, leaving everything dark, wet, and cold. The sword of Gryffindor was hidden they knew not where, and their were three teenagers in a tent whose only achievement was not, yet, to be dead. \"So why are you still here?\" Harry asked Ron. \"Search me,\" said Ron. \"Go home then,\" said Harry. \"Yeah, maybe I will!\" shouted Ron, and he took several steps toward Harry, who did not back away. \"Didn’t you hear what they said about my sister? But you don’t give a rat’s fart, do you, it’s only the Forbidden Forest, Harry I’ve-Faced-Worse Potter doesn’t care what happened to her in there-well, I do, all right, giant spiders and mental stuff-\" \"I was only saying-she was with the others, they were with Hagrid-\" \"Yeah, I get it, you don’t care! And what about the rest of my family, ‘the Weasleys don’t need another kid injured,’ did you hear that?\"\u001f \"Yeah, I-\" \"Not bothered what it meant, though?\" \"Ron!\" said Hermione, forcing her way between them. \"I don’t think it means anything new has happened, anything we don’t know about; think, Ron, Bill’s already scared, plenty of people must have seen that George has lost an ear by now, and you’re supposed to be on your deathbed with spattergroit, I’m sure that’s all he meant-\" \"Oh, you’re sure, are you? Right then, well, I won’t bother myself about them. It’s all right for you, isn’t it, with your parents safely out of the way-\" \"My parents are dead!\" Harry bellowed. \"And mine could be going the same way!\" yelled Ron. \"Then GO!\" roared Harry. \"Go back to them, pretend you’re got over your spattergroit and Mummy’ll be able to feed you up and-\" Ron made a sudden movement: Harry reacted, but before either wand was clear of its owner’s pocket, Hermione had raised her own. \"Prestego!\" she cried, and an invisible shield expanded between her and Harry on the one side and Ron on the other; all of them were forced backward a few steps by the strength of the spell, and Harry and Ron glared from either side of the transparent barrier as though they were seeing each other clearly for the first time. Harry felt a corrosive hatred toward Ron: Something had broken between them. \"Leave the Horcrux,\" Harry said. Ron wrenched the chain from over his head and cast the locket into a nearby chair. He turned to Hermione. \"What are you doing?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Are you staying, or what?\" \"I . . .\" She looked anguished. \"Yes-yes, I’m staying. Ron, we said we’d go with Harry, we said we’d help-\" \"I get it. You choose him.\" \"Ron, no-please-come back, come back!\" She was impeded by her own Shield Charm; by the time she had removed it he had already stormed into the night. Harry stood quite still and silent, listening to her sobbing and calling Ron’s name amongst the trees. After a few minutes she returned, her sopping hair plastered to her face. \"He’s g-g-gone! Disapparated!\" She threw herself into a chair, curled up, and started to cry. Harry felt dazed. He stooped, picked up the Horcrux, and placed it around his own neck. He dragged blankets off Ron’s bunk and threw them over Hermione. Then he climbed onto his own bed and stared up at the dark canvas roof, listening to the pounding of the rain. \n",

            ": Hermione's helping hand As Hermione had predicted, the sixth years' free periods were not the hours of blissful relaxation Ron had anticipated, but times in which to attempt to keep up with the vast amount of homework they were being set. Not only were they studying as though they had exams every day, but the lessons themselves had become more demanding than ever before. Harry barely understood half of what Professor McGonagall said to them these days; even Hermione had had to ask her to repeat instructions once or twice. Incredibly, and to Hermione's increasing resentment, Harry's best subject had suddenly become Potions, thanks to the Half-Blood Prince. Nonverbal spells were now expected, not only in Defense Against the Dark Arts, but in Charms and Transfiguration too. Harry frequently looked over at his classmates in the common room or at mealtimes to see them purple in the face and straining as though they had overdosed on U-No-Poo; but he knew that they were really struggling to make spells work without saying incantations aloud. It was a relief to get outside into the greenhouses; they were dealing with more dangerous plants than ever in Herbology, but at least they were still allowed to swear loudly if the Venomous Tentacula seized them unexpectedly from behind. One result of their enormous workload and the frantic hours of practicing nonverbal spells was that Harry, Ron, and Hermione had so far been unable to find time to go and visit Hagrid. He had stopped coming to meals at the staff table, an ominous sign, and on the few occasions when they had passed him in the corridors or out in the grounds, he had mysteriously failed to notice them or hear their greetings. \"We've got to go and explain,\" said Hermione, looking up at Hagrid's huge empty chair at the staff table the following Saturday at breakfast. \"We've got Quidditch tryouts this morning!\" said Ron. \"And we're supposed to be practicing that Aguamenti Charm from Flitwick! Anyway, explain what? How are we going to tell him we hated his stupid subject?\" \"We didn't hate it!\" said Hermione. \"Speak for yourself, I haven't forgotten the skrewts,\" said Ron darkly. \"And I'm telling you now, we've had a narrow escape. You didn't hear him going on about his gormless brother -- we'd have been teaching Grawp how to tie his shoelaces if we'd stayed.\" \"I hate not talking to Hagrid,\" said Hermione, looking upset. \"We'll go down after Quidditch,\" Harry assured her. He too was missing Hagrid, although like Ron he thought that they were better off without Grawp in their lives. \"But trials might take all morning, the number of people who have applied.\" He felt slightly nervous at confronting the first hurdle of his Captaincy. \"I dunno why the team's this popular all of a sudden.\" \"Oh, come on, Harry,\" said Hermione, suddenly impatient. \"It's not Quidditch that's popular, it's you! You've never been more interesting, and frankly, you've never been more fanciable.\" Ron gagged on a large piece of kipper. Hermione spared him one look of disdain before turning back to Harry. \"Everyone knows you've been telling the truth now, don't they? The whole Wizarding world has had to admit that you were right about Voldemort being back and that you really have fought him twice in the last two years and escaped both times. And now they're calling you 'the Chosen One' -- well, come on, can't you see why people are fascinated by you?\" Harry was finding the Great Hall very hot all of a sudden, even though the ceiling still looked cold and rainy. \"And you've been through all that persecution from the Ministry when they were trying to make out you were unstable and a liar. You can still see the marks on the back of your hand where that evil woman made you write with your own blood, but you stuck to your story anyway. ...\" \"You can still see where those brains got hold of me in the Ministry, look,\" said Ron, shaking back his sleeves. \"And it doesn't hurt that you've grown about a foot over the summer either,\" Hermione finished, ignoring Ron. \"I'm tall,\" said Ron inconsequentially. The post owls arrived, swooping down through rain-flecked windows, scattering everyone with droplets of water. Most people were receiving more post than usual; anxious parents were keen to hear from their children and to reassure them, in turn, that all was well at home. Harry had received no mail since the start of term; his only regular correspondent was now dead and although he had hoped that Lupin might write occasionally, he had so far been disappointed. He was very surprised, therefore, to see the snowy white Hedwig circling amongst all the brown and gray owls. She landed in front of him carrying a large, square package. A moment later, an identical package landed in front of Ron, crushing beneath it his minuscule and exhausted owl, Pigwidgeon. \"Ha!\" said Harry, unwrapping the parcel to reveal a new copy of Advanced Potion-Making, fresh from Flourish and Blotts. \"Oh good,\" said Hermione, delighted. \"Now you can give that graffitied copy back.\" \"Are you mad?\" said Harry. \"I'm keeping it! Look, I've thought it out --\" He pulled the old copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bag and tapped the cover with his wand, muttering, \"Dijjindo!\" The cover fell off. He did the same thing with the brand-new book (Hermione looked scandalized). He then swapped the covers, tapped each, and said, \"Reparo!\" There sat the Prince's copy, disguised as a new book, and there sat the fresh copy from Flourish and Blotts, looking thoroughly secondhand. \"I'll give Slughorn back the new one, he can't complain, it cost nine Galleons.\" Hermione pressed her lips together, looking angry and disapproving, but was distracted by a third owl landing in front of her carrying that day's copy of the Daily Prophet. She unfolded it hastily and scanned the front page. \"Anyone we know dead?\" asked Ron in a determinedly casual voice; he posed the same question every time Hermione opened her paper. \"No, but there have been more dementor attacks,\" said Hermione. \"And an arrest.\" \"Excellent, who?\" said Harry, thinking of Bellatrix Lestrange. \"Stan Shunpike,\" said Hermione. \"What?\" said Harry, startled. \"'Stanley Shunpike, conductor on the popular Wizarding conveyance the Knight Bus, has been arrested on suspicion of Death Eater activity. Mr. Shunpike, 21, was taken into custody late last night after a raid on his Clapham home. . .'\" \"Stan Shunpike, a Death Eater?\" said Harry, remembering the spotty youth he had first met three years before. \"No way!\" \"He might have been put under the Imperius Curse,\" said Ron reasonably. \"You never can tell.\" \"It doesn't look like it,\" said Hermione, who was still reading. \"It says here he was arrested after he was overheard talking about the Death Eaters' secret plans in a pub.\" She looked up with a troubled expression on her face. \"If he was under the Imperius Curse, he'd hardly stand around gossiping about their plans, would he?\" \"It sounds like he was trying to make out he knew more than he did,\" said Ron. \"Isn't he the one who claimed he was going to become Minister of Magic when he was trying to chat up those veela?\" \"Yeah, that's him,\" said Harry. \"I dunno what they're playing at, taking Stan seriously.\" \"They probably want to look as though they're doing something,\" said Hermione, frowning. \"People are terrified -- you know the Patil twins' parents want them to go home? And Eloise Midgen has already been withdrawn. Her father picked her up last night.\" \"What!\" said Ron, goggling at Hermione. \"But Hogwarts is safer than their homes, bound to be! We've got Aurors, and all those extra protective spells, and we've got Dumbledore!\" \"I don't think we've got him all the time,\" said Hermione very quietly, glancing toward the staff table over the top of the Prophet. \"Haven't you noticed? His seat's been empty as often as Hagrid's this past week.\" Harry and Ron looked up at the staff table. The headmaster's chair was indeed empty. Now Harry came to think of it, he had not seen Dumbledore since their private lesson a week ago. \"I think he's left the school to do something with the Order,\" said Hermione in a low voice. \"I mean . . . it's all looking serious, isn't it?\" Harry and Ron did not answer, but Harry knew that they were all thinking the same thing. There had been a horrible incident the day before, when Hannah Abbott had been taken out of Herbology to be told her mother had been found dead. They had not seen Hannah since. When they left the Gryffindor table five minutes later to head down to the Quidditch pitch, they passed Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil. Remembering what Hermione had said about the Patil twins' parents wanting them to leave Hogwarts, Harry was unsurprised to see that the two best friends were whispering together, looking distressed. What did surprise him was that when Ron drew level with them, Parvati suddenly nudged Lavender, who looked around and gave Ron a wide smile. Ron blinked at her, then returned the smile uncertainly. His walk instantly became something more like a strut. Harry resisted the temptation to laugh, remembering that Ron had refrained from doing so after Malfoy had broken Harry's nose; Hermione, however, looked cold and distant all the way down to the stadium through the cool, misty drizzle, and departed to find a place in the stands without wishing Ron good luck. As Harry had expected, the trials took most of the morning. Half of Gryffindor House seemed to have turned up, from first years who were nervously clutching a selection of the dreadful old school brooms, to seventh years who towered over the rest, looking coolly intimidating. The latter included a large, wiry-haired boy Harry recognized immediately from the Hogwarts Express. \"We met on the train, in old Sluggy's compartment,\" he said confidently, stepping out of the crowd to shake Harry's hand. \"Cormac McLaggen, Keeper.\" \"You didn't try out last year, did you?\" asked Harry, taking note of the breadth of McLaggen and thinking that he would probably block all three goal hoops without even moving. \"I was in the hospital wing when they held the trials,\" said McLaggen, with something of a swagger. \"Ate a pound of doxy eggs for a bet.\" \"Right,\" said Harry. \"Well. . . if you wait over there ...\" He pointed over to the edge of the pitch, close to where Hermione was sitting. He thought he saw a flicker of annoyance pass over McLaggen's face and wondered whether McLaggen expected preferential treatment because they were both \"old Sluggy's\" favorites. Harry decided to start with a basic test, asking all applicants for the team to divide into groups of ten and fly once around the pitch. This was a good decision: the first ten was made up of first years, and it could not have been plainer that they had hardly ever flown before. Only one boy managed to remain airborne for more than a few seconds, and he was so surprised he promptly crashed into one of the goal posts. The second group was comprised of ten of the silliest girls Harry had ever encountered, who, when he blew his whistle, merely fell about giggling and clutching one another. Romilda Vane was amongst them. When he told them to leave the pitch, they did so quite cheerfully and went to sit in the stands to heckle everyone else. The third group had a pileup halfway around the pitch. Most of the fourth group had come without broomsticks. The fifth group were Hufflepuffs. \"If there's anyone else here who's not from Gryffindor,\" roared Harry, who was starting to get seriously annoyed, \"leave now, please! There was a pause, then a couple of little Ravenclaws went sprinting off the pitch, snorting with laughter. After two hours, many complaints, and several tantrums, one involving a crashed Comet Two Sixty and several broken teeth, Harry had found himself three Chasers: Katie Bell, returned to the team after an excellent trial; a new find called Demelza Robins, who was particularly good at dodging Bludgers; and Ginny Weasley, who had outflown all the competition and scored seventeen goals to boot. Pleased though he was with his choices, Harry had also shouted himself hoarse at the many complainers and was now enduring a similar battle with the rejected Beaters. \"That's my final decision and if you don't get out of the way of the Keepers I'll hex you,\" he bellowed. Neither of his chosen Beaters had the old brilliance of Fred and George, but he was still reasonably pleased with them: Jimmy Peakes, a short but broad-chested third-year boy who had managed to raise a lump the size of an egg on the back of Harry's head with a ferociously hit Bludger, and Ritchie Coote, who looked weedy but aimed well. They now joined Katie, Demelza, and Ginny in the stands to watch the selection of their last team member. Harry had deliberately left the trial of the Keepers until last, hoping for an emptier stadium and less pressure on all concerned. Unfortunately, however, all the rejected players and a number of people who had come down to watch after a lengthy breakfast had joined the crowd by now, so that it was larger than ever. As each Keeper flew up to the goal hoops, the crowd roared and jeered in equal measure. Harry glanced over at Ron, who had always had a problem with nerves; Harry had hoped that winning their final match last term might have cured it, but apparently not: Ron was a delicate shade of green. None of the first five applicants saved more than two goals apiece. To Harry's great disappointment, Cormac McLaggen saved four penalties out of five. On the last one, however, he shot off in completely the wrong direction; the crowd laughed and booed and McLaggen returned to the ground grinding his teeth. Ron looked ready to pass out as he mounted his Cleansweep Eleven. \"Good luck!\" cried a voice from the stands. Harry looked around, expecting to see Hermione, but it was Lavender Brown. He would have quite liked to have hidden his face in his hands, as she did a moment later, but thought that as the Captain he ought to show slightly more grit, and so turned to watch Ron do his trial. Yet he need not have worried: Ron saved one, two, three, four, five penalties in a row. Delighted, and resisting joining in the cheers of the crowd with difficulty, Harry turned to McLaggen to tell him that, most unfortunately, Ron had beaten him, only to find McLaggen's red face inches from his own. He stepped back hastily. \"His sister didn't really try,\" said McLaggen menacingly. There was a vein pulsing in his temple like the one Harry had often ad-mired in Uncle Vernon's. \"She gave him an easy save.\" \"Rubbish,\" said Harry coldly. \"That was the one he nearly missed.\" McLaggen took a step nearer Harry, who stood his ground this time. \"Give me another go.\" \"No,\" said Harry. \"You've had your go. You saved four. Ron saved five. Ron's Keeper, he won it fair and square. Get out of my way.\" He thought for a moment that McLaggen might punch him, but he contented himself with an ugly grimace and stormed away, growling what sounded like threats to thin air. Harry turned around to find his new team beaming at him. \"Well done,\" he croaked. \"You flew really well --\" \"You did brilliantly, Ron!\" This time it really was Hermione running toward them from the stands; Harry saw Lavender walking off the pitch, arm in arm with Parvati, a rather grumpy expression on her face. Ron looked extremely pleased with himself and even taller than usual as he grinned at the team and at Hermione. After fixing the time of their first full practice for the following Thursday, Harry, Ron, and Hermione bade good-bye to the rest of the team and headed off toward Hagrid's. A watery sun was trying to break through the clouds now and it had stopped drizzling at last. Harry felt extremely hungry; he hoped there would be some-thing to eat at Hagrid's. \"I thought I was going to miss that fourth penalty,\" Ron was saying happily. \"Tricky shot from Demelza, did you see, had a bit of spin on it --\" \"Yes, yes, you were magnificent,\" said Hermione, looking amused. \"I was better than that McLaggen anyway,\" said Ron in a highly satisfied voice. \"Did you see him lumbering off in the wrong direction on his fifth? Looked like he'd been Confunded. ...\" To Harry's surprise, Hermione turned a very deep shade of pink at these words. Ron noticed nothing; he was too busy describing each of his other penalties in loving detail. The great gray hippogriff, Buckbeak, was tethered in front of Hagrid's cabin. He clicked his razor-sharp beak at their approach and turned his huge head toward them. \"Oh dear,\" said Hermione nervously. \"He's still a bit scary, isn't he?\" \"Come off it, you've ridden him, haven't you?\" said Ron. Harry stepped forward and bowed low to the hippogriff without breaking eye contact or blinking. After a few seconds, Buckbeak sank into a bow too. \"How are you?\" Harry asked him in a low voice, moving forward to stroke the feathery head. \"Missing him? But you're okay here with Hagrid, aren't you?\" \"Oi!\" said a loud voice. Hagrid had come striding around the corner of his cabin wearing a large flowery apron and carrying a sack of potatoes. His enormous boarhound, Fang, was at his heels; Fang gave a booming bark and bounded forward. \"Git away from him! He'll have yer fingers -- oh. It's yeh lot.\" Fang was jumping up at Hermione and Ron, attempting to lick their ears. Hagrid stood and looked at them all for a split second, then turned and strode into his cabin, slamming the door behind him. \"Oh dear!\" said Hermione, looking stricken. \"Don't worry about it,\" said Harry grimly. He walked over to the door and knocked loudly. \"Hagrid! Open up, we want to talk to you!\" There was no sound from within. \"If you don't open the door, we'll blast it open!\" Harry said, pulling out his wand. \"Harry!\" said Hermione, sounding shocked. \"You can't possibly --\" \"Yeah, I can!\" said Harry. \"Stand back --\" But before he could say anything else, the door flew open again as Harry had known it would, and there stood Hagrid, glowering down at him and looking, despite the flowery apron, positively alarming. \"I'm a teacher!\" he roared at Harry. \"A teacher, Potter! How dare yeh threaten ter break down my door!\" \"I'm sorry, sir\" said Harry, emphasizing the last word as he stowed his wand inside his robes. Hagrid looked stunned. \"Since when have yeh called me 'sir'?\" \"Since when have you called me 'Potter'?\" \"Oh, very clever,\" growled Hagrid. \"Very amusin'. That's me outsmarted, innit? All righ', come in then, yeh ungrateful little . . .\" Mumbling darkly, he stood back to let them pass. Hermione scurried in after Harry, looking rather frightened. \"Well?\" said Hagrid grumpily, as Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down around his enormous wooden table, Fang laying his head immediately upon Harry's knee and drooling all over his robes. \"What's this? Feelin' sorry for me? Reckon I'm lonely or summat?\" \"No,\" said Harry at once. \"We wanted to see you.\" \"We've missed you!\" said Hermione tremulously. \"Missed me, have yeh?\" snorted Hagrid. \"Yeah. Righ'.\" He stomped around, brewing up tea in his enormous copper kettle, muttering all the while. Finally he slammed down three bucket-sized mugs of mahogany-brown tea in front of them and a plate of his rock cakes. Harry was hungry enough even for Hagrid's cooking, and took one at once. \"Hagrid,\" said Hermione timidly, when he joined them at the table and started peeling his potatoes with a brutality that suggested that each tuber had done him a great personal wrong, \"we really wanted to carry on with Care of Magical Creatures, you know.\" Hagrid gave another great snort. Harry rather thought some bo-geys landed on the potatoes, and was inwardly thankful that they were not staying for dinner. \"We did!\" said Hermione. \"But none of us could fit it into our schedules!\" \"Yeah. Righ',\" said Hagrid again. There was a funny squelching sound and they all looked around: Hermione let out a tiny shriek, and Ron leapt out of his seat and hurried around the table away from the large barrel standing in the corner that they had only just noticed. It was full of what looked like foot-long maggots, slimy, white, and writhing. \"What are they, Hagrid?\" asked Harry, trying to sound interested rather than revolted, but putting down his rock cake all the same. \"Jus' giant grubs,\" said Hagrid. \"And they grow into ... ?\" said Ron, looking apprehensive. \"They won' grow inter nuthin',\" said Hagrid. \"I got 'em ter feed ter Aragog.\" And without warning, he burst into tears. \"Hagrid!\" cried Hermione, leaping up, hurrying around the table the long way to avoid the barrel of maggots, and putting an arm around his shaking shoulders. \"What is it?\" \"It's. . . him . ..\" gulped Hagrid, his beetle-black eyes stream-ing as he mopped his face with his apron. \"It's . . . Aragog. ... I think he's dyin'. . , . He got ill over the summer an' he's not gettin' better.... I don' know what I'll do if he ... if he ... We've bin tergether so long. ...\" Hermione patted Hagrid's shoulder, looking at a complete loss for anything to say. Harry knew how she felt. He had known Hagrid to present a vicious baby dragon with a teddy bear, seen him croon over giant scorpions with suckers and stingers, attempt to reason with his brutal giant of a half-brother, but this was perhaps the most incomprehensible of all his monster fancies: the gigantic talking spider, Aragog, who dwelled deep in the Forbidden Forest and which he and Ron had only narrowly escaped four years previously. \"Is there -- is there anything we can do?\" Hermione asked, ignoring Ron's frantic grimaces and head-shakings. \"I don' think there is, Hermione,\" choked Hagrid, attempting to stem the flood of his tears. \"See, the rest o' the tribe ... Aragog's family . . . they're gettin' a bit funny now he's ill... bit restive ...\" \"Yeah, I think we saw a bit of that side of them,\" said Ron in an undertone. \"... I don' reckon it'd be safe fer anyone but me ter go near the colony at the mo',\" Hagrid finished, blowing his nose hard on his apron and looking up. \"But thanks fer offerin', Hermione. ... It means a lot.\" After that, the atmosphere lightened considerably, for although neither Harry nor Ron had shown any inclination to go and feed giant grubs to a murderous, gargantuan spider, Hagrid seemed to take it for granted that they would have liked to have done and became his usual self once more. \"Ar, I always knew yeh'd find it hard ter squeeze me inter yer timetables,\" he said gruffly, pouring them more tea. \"Even if yeh applied fer Time-Turners --\" \"We couldn't have done,\" said Hermione. \"We smashed the entire stock of Ministry Time-Turners when we were there last summer. It was in the Daily Prophet.\" \"Ar, well then,\" said Hagrid. \"There's no way yeh could've done it. ... I'm sorry I've bin -- yeh know -- I've jus' bin worried about Aragog ... an I did wonder whether, if Professor Grubbly-Plank had bin teachin' yeh --\" At which all three of them stated categorically and untruthfully that Professor Grubbly-Plank, who had substituted for Hagrid a few times, was a dreadful teacher, with the result that by the time Hagrid waved them off the premises at dusk, he looked quite cheerful. \"I'm starving,\" said Harry, once the door had closed behind them and they were hurrying through the dark and deserted grounds; he had abandoned the rock cake after an ominous cracking noise from one of his back teeth. \"And I've got that detention with Snape tonight, I haven't got much time for dinner.\" As they came into the castle they spotted Cormac McLaggen entering the Great Hall. It took him two attempts to get through the doors; he ricocheted off the frame on the first attempt. Ron merely guffawed gloatingly and strode off into the Hall after him, but Harry caught Hermione's arm and held her back. \"What?\" said Hermione defensively. \"If you ask me,\" said Harry quietly, \"McLaggen looks like he was Confunded this morning. And he was standing right in front of where you were sitting.\" Hermione blushed. \"Oh, all right then, I did it,\" she whispered. \"But you should have heard the way he was talking about Ron and Ginny! Anyway, he's got a nasty temper, you saw how he reacted when he didn't get in -- you wouldn't have wanted someone like that on the team.\" \"No,\" said Harry. \"No, I suppose that's true. But wasn't that dishonest, Hermione? I mean, you're a prefect, aren't you?\" \"Oh, be quiet,\" she snapped, as he smirked. \"What are you two doing?\" demanded Ron, reappearing in the doorway to the Great Hall and looking suspicious. \"Nothing,\" said Harry and Hermione together, and they hurried after Ron. The smell of roast beef made Harry's stomach ache with hunger, but they had barely taken three steps toward the Gryffindor table when Professor Slughorn appeared in front of them, blocking their path. \"Harry, Harry, just the man I was hoping to see!\" he boomed genially, twiddling the ends of his walrus mustache and puffing out his enormous belly, \"I was hoping to catch you before dinner! What do you say to a spot of supper tonight in my rooms instead? We're having a little party, just a few rising stars, I've got McLaggen coming and Zabini, the charming Melinda Bobbin -- I don't know whether you know her? Her family owns a large chain of apothecaries -- and, of course, I hope very much that Miss Granger will favor me by coming too.\" Slughorn made Hermione a little bow as he finished speaking. It was as though Ron was not present; Slughorn did not so much as look at him. \"I can't come, Professor,\" said Harry at once. \"I've got a detention with Professor Snape.\" \"Oh dear!\" said Slughorn, his face falling comically. \"Dear, dear, I was counting on you, Harry! Well, now, I'll just have to have a word with Severus and explain the situation. I'm sure I'll be able to persuade him to postpone your detention. Yes, I'll see you both later!\" He bustled away out of the Hall. \"He's got no chance of persuading Snape,\" said Harry, the moment Slughorn was out of earshot. \"This detention’s already been postponed once; Snape did it for Dumbledore, but he won't do it for anyone else.\" \"Oh, I wish you could come, I don't want to go on my own!\" said Hermione anxiously; Harry knew that she was thinking about McLaggen. \"I doubt you'll be alone, Ginny'll probably be invited,\" snapped Ron, who did not seem to have taken kindly to being ignored by Slughorn. After dinner they made their way back to Gryffindor Tower. The common room was very crowded, as most people had finished dinner by now, but they managed to find a free table and sat down; Ron, who had been in a bad mood ever since the encounter with Slughorn, folded his arms and frowned at the ceiling. Hermione reached out for a copy of the Evening Prophet, which somebody had left abandoned on a chair. \"Anything new?\" said Harry. \"Not really. . .\" Hermione had opened the newspaper and was scanning the inside pages. \"Oh, look, your dad's in here, Ron -- he's all right!\" she added quickly, for Ron had looked around in alarm. \"It just says he's been to visit the Malfoys' house. 'This second search of the Death Eaters residence does not seem to have yielded any results. Arthur Weasley of the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects said that his team had been acting upon a confidential tip-off.'\" \"Yeah, mine!\" said Harry. \"I told him at Kings Cross about Malfoy and that thing he was trying to get Borgin to fix! Well, if it's not at their house, he must have brought whatever it is to Hogwarts with him --\" \"But how can he have done, Harry?\" said Hermione, putting down the newspaper with a surprised look. \"We were all searched when we arrived, weren't we?\" \"Were you?\" said Harry, taken aback. \"I wasn't!\" \"Oh no, of course you weren't, I forgot you were late. Well, Filch ran over all of us with Secrecy Sensors when we got into the entrance hall. Any Dark object would have been found, I know for a fact Crabbe had a shrunken head confiscated. So you see, Malfoy can't have brought in anything dangerous!\" Momentarily stymied, Harry watched Ginny Weasley playing with Arnold the Pygmy Puff for a while before seeing a way around this objection. \"Someone's sent it to him by owl, then,\" he said. \"His mother or someone.\" \"All the owls are being checked too,\" said Hermione. \"Filch told us so when he was jabbing those Secrecy Sensors everywhere he could reach.\" Really stumped this time, Harry found nothing else to say. There did not seem to be any way Malfoy could have brought a dangerous or Dark object into the school. He looked hopefully at Ron, who was sitting with his arms folded, staring over at Lavender Brown. \"Can you think of any way Malfoy -- ?\" \"Oh, drop it, Harry,\" said Ron. \"Listen, it's not my fault Slughorn invited Hermione and me to his stupid party, neither of us wanted to go, you know!\" said Harry, firing up. \"Well, as I'm not invited to any parties,\" said Ron, getting to his feet again, \"I think I'll go to bed.\" He stomped off toward the door to the boys' dormitories, leaving Harry and Hermione staring after him. \"Harry?\" said the new Chaser, Demelza Robins, appearing suddenly at his shoulder. \"I've got a message for you.\" \"From Professor Slughorn?\" asked Harry, sitting up hopefully. \"No ... from Professor Snape,\" said Demelza. Harry's heart sank. \"He says you're to come to his office at half past eight tonight to do your detention -- er -- no matter how many party invitations you've received. And he wanted you to know you'll be sorting out rotten flobberworms from good ones, to use in Potions and -- and he says there's no need to bring protective gloves.\" \"Right,\" said Harry grimly. \"Thanks a lot, Demelza.\" \n",

Hagrid had already singlehandedly delivered the usual twelve C hristmas trees to the Great Hall; garlands of holly and tinsel had been twisted around the banisters of the stairs; everlasting candles glowed from inside the helmets of suits of armor and great bunches of mistletoe had been hung at intervals along the corridors. Large groups of girls tended to converge underneath the mistletoe bunches every time Harry went past, which caused blockages in the corridors; fortunat e ly, however, Harry's frequent nighttime wanderings had given him an unusually good knowledge of the castle's secret passageways, so that he was often, without too much difficulty, to naviga t e mistletoe-free routes between classes. Ron, who might once have found the necessity of these detours excuse for jealousy rather than hilarity, simply roared with laughter about it all. Although Harry much preferred this new laughing, joking Ron to the moody, aggressive model he had been enduring for the last few weeks, the improved Ron came at a heavy price. Firstly, Harry had to put up with the frequent presence of Lavender Brown, who seemed to regard any moment that she was not kissing Ron as a moment wasted; and secondly, Harry found himself once more the best friend of two people who seemed unlikely ever to speak to each other again. Ron, whose hands and forearms still bore scratches and cuts from Hermione's bird attack, was taking a defensive and resentful tone. \"She can't complain,\" he told Harry. \"She snogged Krum. So she's found out someone wants to snog me too. Well, it's a free country. I haven't done anything wrong.\" Harry did not answer, but pretended to be absorbed in the book they were supposed to have read before Charms next morning (Quintessence: A Q uest). Determined as he was to remain friends with both Ron and Hermione, he was spending a lot of time with his mouth shut tight. \"I never promised Hermione anything , \" Ron mumbled. \"I mean, all right, I was going to go to Slughorn's Christmas party with her, but she never said... just as friends... I'm a free agent...\" Harry turned a page of Quintessence, aware that Ron was watching him. Ron's voice trailed away in mutters, barely audible over the loud crackling of the fire, though Harry thought he caught the words \"Krum\" and \"Can't complain\" again. Hermione's schedule was so full that Harry could only talk to her properly in the evenings, when Ron was, in any case, so tightly wrapped around Lavender that he did not notice what Harry was doing. Hermione refused to sit in the common room while Ron was there, So Harry generally joined her in the library, which meant that their conversations were held in whispers. \"He's at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes,\" said Hermione, while the librarian , Madam Pince, prowled the shelves behind them. \"I really couldn't care less.\" She raised her quill and dotted an 'i' so ferociously that she punctured a hole in her parchment. Harry said nothing. He thought his voice might soon vanish from the lack of use. He bent a little lower over Advanced Potion-Making and continued to make notes on Everlasting Elixirs, occasionally pausing to decipher the p rince's useful additions to Libatius B orage's text. \"And incidentally,\" said Hermione, after a few moments, \"you need to be careful.\" \"For the last time,\" said Harry, speaking in a slightly hoarse tone after three-quarters of an ho u r of silence, \"I am not giving back this book . I've learned more from the Half-blood p rince than Snape or Slughorn have taught me in--\" \"I'm not talking about your stupid so-called prince,\" said Hermione , giving his book a nasty look as though it had been rude to her. \"I'm talki ng about earlier. I went into the girl's bathroom just before I came in here and there were about a dozen girls in there, including that Romilda Vane , trying to decide how to slip you a love potion. They're all hoping they're going to get you to take them to Slughorn's party, and thay all seem to have bought Fred and George's love potions, which I'm afraid to say probably work --\" \"Why didn't you confiscate them then?\" demanded Harry, it seemed extraordinary that Hermione's m ania for upholding the rules could have abandoned her at this crucial juncture. \"They didn't have the potions with them in the bathroom,\" said Hermione scornfully, \"They were just discussing tactics. As I doubt the Half-blood prince\" she gave the book another scornful look \"could dream up an antidote for a dozen different love potions at once, I'd just invite someone to go with you, that'll stop all the others thinking they've still got a chance. It's tomor r ow night, they're getting desperate.\" \"There isn't anyone I want to invite,\" mumbled Harry, who was still not trying to think about Ginny any more than he could help, despite the fact the fact that she kept cropping up in his dreams in ways that made him devoutly thankful that Ron could not perform Legilimency. \"Well, just be careful what you drink, because Romilda Va ne looked like she meant business.\" said Hermione grimly. She hitched up the long roll of parchment on which she was writing her Arithma n cy essay and continued to scratch away with her quill. Harry wa t che d her with his mind a long way away. \"Hang on a moment,\" he said slowly. \"I thought Filch had banned anything bought at Weasley's Wizard Wheezes?\" \"And when has anyone ever paid attention to what Filch has banned?\" asked Hermione, still concentrating on her essay. \"But I thought all the owls were being searched. So how come these grils are able to bring love potions into the school?\" \"Fred and George send them disguised as perfumes and cough potions,\" said Hermione. \"It's part of their Owl order service.\" \"You know a lot about it.\" Hermione gave him the kind of nasty look she had just given his copy of Advanced Potion-Making. \"It was all on the back of the bottles they showed Ginny and me in the summer,\" she said coldly, \"I don't go around putting potions in people's drinks... or pretending too eit h er, which is just as bad...\" \"Yeah, well, never mind that,\" said Harry quickly. \"The point is, Filch is being fooled isn't he? These girls are getting stuff into the school disguised as something else! So why couldn't Malfoy have brought the necklace into the school --?\" \"Oh, Harry... not that again...\" \"Come on, why not?\" demanded Harry. \"Look , \" sighed Hermione, \"Secrecy Sensors detect jinxes, curses, and concealment charms, don't they? They're used to find d ark magic and d ark obje c ts. They'd have picked up a powerful curse , like the one in the necklace, withi n seconds. But something that's just been put in the wrong bottle wouldn ' t register -- anyway Love potions aren't d ark or dangerous -\" \"Easy for you to say,\" muttered Harry, thinking of Romilda Vane. \"-- so it would be down to Filch to realise it wasn't a cough potion, and he's not a very good wizard, I doubt he can tell one potion from --\" Hermione stopped dead; Harry had heard it too. Somebody had moved close behind them among the dark bookshelves. They waited, and a moment later the vulturelike countenance of Madam Pince appeared around the corner, her sunken cheeks, her skin like parchment, and her long hooked nose illuminated unflatteringly by the lamp she was carrying. \"The library is now closed,\" she said, \"Mind you return anything you have borrowed to the correct -- what have you been doing to that book, you depraved boy?\" \"It isn't the library's, it's mine!\" said Harry hastily, snatching his copy of Advanced Potion-Making off the table as she lunged at it with a clawlike hand. \" Spoiled!\" she hissed . \"Desecrated, befouled !\" \"It's just a book that's been written on!\" said Harry, tugging it out of her grip. She looked as though she might have a seizure; Hermione, who had hastily packed her things, grabbed Harry by the arm and frogmarched him away. \"She'll ban you from the library if you're not careful. Why did you have to bring that stupid book?\" \"It's not my fault she's barking mad, Hermione. Or d'you think she overheard you being rude about Filch? I've always thought there might be something between them...\" \"Oh, ha ha..\" Enjoying the fact that they could speak normally again, they made their way along the deserted lamp-lit corridors back to the common room, arguing w hether or not Filch and Madam Pince were secretly in love with each other. \"Baubles\" said Harry to the Fat Lady, this being the new, festive password. \"Same to you,\" said the fat lady with a roguish grin, and she swung forward to admit them. \"Hi, Harry!\" said Romilda Vane, the moment he had climbed through the portrait hole. \"Fancy a gillywater?\" Hermione gave him a \"what-did-I-tell-you?\" look over her shoulder. \"No thanks,\" said Harry quickly. \"I don't like it much.\" \"Well, take these anyway,\" said Romilda, thrusting a box into his hands. \"Chocolate Cauldrons, they've got firewhiskey in them. My gran sent them to me, but I don't like them.\" \"Oh-- right -- thanks a lot.\" said Harry, who could not think what else to say. \" Er-- I ' m just going over here with ...\" He hurried off behind Hermione, his voice tailing away feebly. \"Told you,\" said Hermione succinctly, \" Sooner you ask someone, sooner they'll all leave you alone and you can --\" But her face suddnly turned blank; she had just spotted Ron and Lavender, who were i ntertwined in the same armchair. \"Well, good night, Harry\" said Hermione, though it was only seven o'clock in the evening, and she left for the girl s' dormitory without another word. Harry went to bed comforting himself that there was only one more day of lessons to struggle through, plus Slughorn's party, after which he and Ron would depart together for the B urrow. It now seemed impossible that Ron and Hermione would make up with each other before the holidays began, but perhaps, somehow, the break would give them time to calm down, think better of their behavior... But his hopes were not high, and they sank still lower after enduring a Transfiguration lesson with them both next day. They had just embarked upon the immensely difficult topic of human transfiguration; working in front of mirrors , they were suposed to be changing the color of their own eyebrows. Hermione laughed unkindly at Ron's disastrous first attempt, during which he somehow managed to give himself a spectacular handlebar mustache; Ron retaliated by doing a cruel but accurate impression of Hermione jumping up and down in her seat every time Profe s sor McGonagall asked a question, which Lavender and Parvati found deeply amusing and which reduced Hermione to the verge of tears again. She raced out of the classroom on the bell, leaving half her things behind; Harry, deciding that her need was greater than Ron's just now, scooped up her remaining po ssessions and followed her. He finally tracked her down as she emerged from a girl's bathroom on the floor below. She was accompanied by Luna Lovegood, who was patting her vaguely on the back. \"Oh, hello, Harry , \" said Luna . \" D id you know one of your eyebrows is bright yellow?\" \"Hi, Luna. Hermione , you left your stuff...\" He held out her books. \"Oh, yes,\" said Hermione in a choked voice, taking her things and turning away quickly to hide the fact she was wiping her eyes with her pencil case. \"Thank you , Harry. Well, I'd better get going...\" And she hurried off, without ever giving Harry any time to offer words of comfort, though admittedly he could not think of any. \"She's a bit upset , \" said Luna. \"I thought at first it was Moaning Myrtle in there, but it turned out to be Hermione. She said something about Ron Weasley...\" \"Yeah, they've had a row,\" said Harry. \"He says funny things sometimes, doesn't he?\" said Luna as they set off down the corridor together. \"But he can be a bit unkind. I noticed that last year.\" \" I s'pose , \" said Harry. Luna was demonstrating her usual knack of speaking uncomfortable truths; he had never met anyone quite like her. \"So have you had a good term?\" \"Oh, it's been al l right,\" said Luna. \" A bit lonely without the D.A. Ginny's been nice, though. She stopped two boys in our Transfiguration class calling me 'Loony' the other day --\" \"How would you like to come to S lughorn's party with me tonight?\" The words were out of Harry's mouth before he could stop them; he heard himself say them as though it were a stranger speaking. Luna turned her protuberant eyes to him in surprise. \"Slughorn's party? With you?\" \"Yeah,\" said Harry, \"We're supposed to bring guests, so I thought you might like.. I mean...\" He was keen to make his intentions perfectly clear. \" I mean, just as friends, you know. But if you don't want to...\" He was already half hoping that she didn't want to. \"O h no, I'd love to go with you as friends!\" said Luna, beaming as he had never seen her beam before. \"Nobody's ever asked me to a party before, as a friend! Is that why you dyed your eyebrow, for the party? Should I dye mine too?\" \"No\" said Harry firmly, \"That was a mistake. I'll get Hermione to put it right for me. So I'll meet you in the entrance hall at eight o'clock then . \" \"AHA!\" screamed a voice from overhead and both of them jumped; unnoticed by either of them, they had just passed underneath Peeves, who was hanging upside down from a chandelier and grinning maliciously at them. \"Potty asked Loony to go to the part y ! Potty lurves Loony! Potty luuuuuurves Looooony!\" And he zoomed away cackling and shrieking, \"Potty loves Loony!\" \"Nice to keep these things private,\" said Harry. And sure enough, in no time at all the whole school seemed to know that Harry Potter was taking Luna Lovegood to Slughorn's party. \"You could've taken anyone!\" said Ron in disbelief over dinner. \"Anyone! And you chose Loony Lovegood?\" \"Don't call her that, Ron!\" snapped Ginny, pausing behind Harry on her way to join friends. \"I'm really glad you're taking her Harry, she's so excited.\" And she moved on down the table to sit with Dean. Harry tried to feel pleased that Ginny was glad he was taking Luna to the party but could not quite manage it. A long way along the table Hermione was sitting alone, playing with her stew. Harry noticed Ron looking at her furtively. \"You could say sorry , \" suggested Harry bluntly. \"What , and get attacked by another flock of canaries?\" muttered Ron. \"What did you have to imitate her for?\" \"She laughed at my mustache!\" \"So did I, it was the stupidest thing I've ever seen.\" But Ron did not seem to have he a rd; Lavender had just arrived with Parvati. Squeezing herself in between Harry and Ron, Lavender flung her arms around Ron's neck. \"Hi, Harry,\" said Parvati who, like Harry, looked faintly embarrassed and bored by the behavior of their two friends. \"Hi,\" said Harry, \"How're you? You're staying at Hogwarts, then? I heard your parents wanted you to leave.\" \"I managed to talk them out o f it for the time being,\" said Parvati. \"That Katie thing really freaked them out, but as there hasn't been anything since... Oh, hi, Hermione!\" Parvati positively beamed. Harry could tell that she was feeling guilty for having laughed at Hermione in Transfiguration. He looked around and saw that Hermione was beaming back, if possible even more brightly. Girls were very strange sometimes. \"Hi, Parvati!\" said Hermione, ignoring Ron and Lavender completely. \"Are you going to Slughorn's party tonight?\" \"No invite,\" said Parvati gloomily. \"I'd love to go, though, it sounds like it's going to be really good... You're going, aren't you?\" \"Yes, I'm meeting Cormac at eight, and we're -\" There was a noise like a plunger being withdrawn from a blocked sink , and Ron surfaced. Hermione acted as though she had not seen or heard anything. \"- we're going up to the party together.\" \"Cormac?\" said Parvati. \"Cormac McLaggen, you mean?\" \"That's right,\" said Hermione sweetly. \"The one who *almost*\" - she put a great deal of emphasis on the word - \"bec a me Gryffindor Keeper.\" \"Are you going out with him, then?\" asked Parvati, wide-eyed. \"Oh - yes - didn't you know?\" said Harmione, with a most un-Hermione-ish giggle. \"No!\" said Parvati, looking positively agog at thi s piece of gossip. \"Wow , you like your Quidditch players, don't you? First Krum, then McLaggen.\" \"I like *really good* Quidditch players,\" Hermione corrected her, still smiling. \"Well, see you... Got to go and get ready for the party...\" She left. At once Lavender and Parvati put their heads together to discuss this new development, with everything they had ever heard about McLaggen, and all they had ever guessed about Hermione. Ron looked strangely blank and said nothing. Harry was left to ponder in silence the depths to which girls would sink to get revenge. When he arrived in the entrance hall at eight o'clock that night, he found an unusually large number of girls lurking there, all of whom seemed to be staring at him resentfully as he approached Luna. She was wearing a set of spangled silver robes that were attracting a certain amount of giggles from the onlookers, but otherwise she looked quite nice. Harry was glad, in any case, that she had left off her radish earrings, her butterbeer cork necklace, and her Spectrespecs. \"Hi,\" he said. \"Shall we get going then?\" \"Oh yes,\" she said happily. \"Where is the party?\" \"Slughorn's office,\" said Harry, leading her up the marble staircase away from all the staring and muttering. \"Did you hear, there's supposed to be a vampire coming?\" \"Rufus Scrimgeour?\" asked Luna. \"I - what?\" said Harry, disconcerted. \"You mean the Minister of Magic?\" \"Yes, he's a vampire,\" said Luna matter-of-factly. \"Father wrote a very long article about it when Scrimgeour first took over from Cornelius Fudge, but he was forced not to publish by somebody from the Ministry. Obviously, they didn't want the truth to get out!\" Harry, who thought it most unlikely that Rufus Scrimgeour was a vampire, but who was used to Luna repeating her father's bizarre views as though they were fact, did not reply; they were already approaching Slughorn's office and the sounds of laughter, music, and loud conversation were growing louder with every step they took. Whether it had been built that way, or because he had used magical trickery to make it so, Slughorn's office was much larger than the usual teacher's study. The ceiling and walls had been draped with emerald, crimson , and gold hangings, so that it looked as though they were all inside a vast tent. The room was crowded and stuffy and bathed in the red light cast by an ornate golden lamp dangling from the center of the ceiling in which real fairies were fluttering, each a brilliant speck of light. Loud singing accompanied by what sounded like mandolins issued from a distant corner; a haze of pipe smoke hung over several elderly warlocks deep in conversation, and a number of house-elves were negotiating their way squeakily through the forest of knees, obscured by the heavy silver platters of food they were bearing, so that they looked like little roving tables. \"Harry, m'boy!\" boomed Slughorn, almost as soon as Harry and Luna had squeezed in through the door. \"Come in, come in, so many people I'd like you to meet!\" Slughorn was wearing a tasseled velvet hat to match his smoking jacket. Gripping Harry's arm so tightly he might have been hoping to Disapparate with him, Slughorn led him purposefully into the party; Harry seized Luna's hand and dragged her along with him. \"Harry, I'd like you to meet Eldred Worple, an old student of mine, author of ' Blood Brothers: My L ife Amongst the Vampires' - and, of course, his friend Sanguini.\" Worple, who was a small, stout, bespectacled man, grabbed Harry's hand and shook it enthusiastically; the vampire Sanguini, who was tall and emaciated with dark shadows under his eyes, merely nodded. He looked rather bored. A gaggle of girls was standing close to him, looking curious and excited. \"Harry Potter, I am simply delighted!\" said Worple, peering shortsightedly up into Harry's face. \"I was saying to Professor Slughorn only the other day, 'Where is the biography of Harry Potter for which we have all been waiting?'\" \"Er,\" said Harry, \"were you?\" \"Just as modest as Horace described!\" said Worple. \"But seri-ously\" -- his manner changed; it became suddenly businesslike -- \"I would be delighted to write it myself-- people are craving to know more about you, dear boy, craving! If you were prepared to grant me a few interviews, say in four- or five-hour sessions, why, we could have the book finished within months. And all with very little effort on your part, I assure you -- ask Sanguini here if it isn't quite -- Sanguini, stay here!\" added Worple, suddenly stern, for the vampire had been edging toward the nearby group of girls, a rather hungry look in his eye. \"Here, have a pasty,\" said Worple, seizing one from a passing elf and stuffing it into Sanguini's hand before turning his attention back to Harry. \"My dear boy, the gold you could make, you have no idea --\" \"I'm definitely not interested,\" said Harry firmly, \"and I've just seen a friend of mine, sorry.\" He pulled Luna after him into the crowd; he had indeed just seen a long mane of brown hair disappear between what looked like two members of the Weird Sisters. \"Hermione! Hermione !\" \"Harry! There you are, thank goodness! Hi, Luna !\" \"What's happened to you?\" asked Harry, for Hermione looked distinctly disheveled, rather as though she had just fought her way out of a thicket of Devil's Snare. \"Oh, I've just escaped -- I mean, I've just left Cormac,\" she said. \"Under the mistletoe,\" she added in explanation, as Harry continued to look questioningly at her. \"Serves you right for coming with him,\" he told her severely. \"I thought he'd annoy Ron most,\" said Hermione dispassion-ately. \"I debated for a while about Zacharias Smith, but I thought, on the whole --\" \"You considered Smith?\" said Harry, revoked. \"Yes, I did, and I'm starting to wish I'd chosen him, McLaggen makes Grawp look a gentleman. Let's go this way, we'll be able to see him coming, he's so tall. . . .\" The three of them made their way over to the other side of the room, scooping up goblets of mead on the way, realizing too late that Professor Trelawney was standing there alone. \"Hello,\" said Luna politely to Professor Trelawney. \"Good evening, my dear,\" said Professor Trelawney, focusing upon Luna with some difficulty. Harry could smell cooking sherry again. \"I haven't seen you in my classes lately. ..\" \"No, I've got Firenze this year,\" said Luna. \"Oh, of course,\" said Professor Trelawney with an angry, drunken titter. \"Or Dobbin, as I prefer to think of him. You would have thought, would you not, that now I am returned to the school Professor Dumbledore might have got rid of the horse? But no ... we share classes. . . . It's an insult, frankly, an insult. Do you know. . .\" Professor Trelawney seemed too tipsy to have recognized Harry. Under cover of her furious criticisms of Firenze, Harry drew closer to Hermione and said, \"Let ' s get something straight. Are you planning to tell Ron that you interfered at Keeper tryouts?\" Hermione raised her eyebrows. \"Do you really think I'd stoop that low?\" Harry looked at her shrewdly. \"Hermione, if you can ask 0111 McLaggen --\" \"There's a difference,\" said Hermione with dignity. \"I've got no plans to tell Ron anything about what might, or might not, have happened at Keeper tryouts.\" \"Good,\" said Harry fervently. \"Because he'll just fall apart again, and we'll lose the next match --\" \"Quidditch!\" said Hermione angrily. \"Is that all boys care about? Cormac hasn't asked me one single question about myself, no, I've just been treated to 'A Hundred Great Saves Made by Cormac McLaggen' nonstop ever since -- oh no, here he comes!\" She moved so fast it was as though she had Disapparated; one moment she was there, the next, she had squeezed between two guffawing witches and vanished. \"Seen Hermione?\" asked McLaggen, forcing his way through the throng a minute later. \"No, sorry,\" said Harry, and he turned quickly to join in Luna's conversation, forgetting for a split second to whom she was talking. \"Harry Potter!\" said Professor Trelawney in deep, vibrant tones, noticing him for the first time. \"Oh, hello,\" said Harry unenthusiastically. \"My dear boy!\" she said in a very carrying whisper. \"The rumors! The stories! 'The Chosen One'! Of course, I have known for a very long time. . . . The omens were never good, Harry. . . But why have you not returned to Divination? For you, of all people, the subject is of the utmost importance!\" \"Ah, Sybi l l, we all think our subject's most important!\" said a loud voice, and Slughorn appeared at Professor Trelawney s other side, his face very red, his velvet hat a little askew, a glass of mead in one hand and an enormous mince pie in the other. \"But I don't t hink I've ever known such a natural at Potions!\" said Slughorn, re-garding Harry with a fond, if bloodshot, eye. \"Instinctive, you know -- like his mother! I've only ever taught a few with this kind of ability, I can tell you that, Sybi l l -- why even Severus --\" And to Harry's horror, Slughorn threw out an arm and seemed to scoop Snape out of thin air toward them. \"Stop skulking and come and join us, Severus!\" hiccuped Slughorn happily. \"I was just talking about Harry's exceptional po-tion-making! Some credit must go to you, of course, you taught him for five years!\" Trapped, with Slughorns arm around his shoulders, Snape looked down his hooked nose at Harry, his black eyes narrowed. \"Funny, I never had the impression that I managed to teach Potter anything at all.\" \"Well, then, it's natural ability!\" shouted Slughorn. \"You should have seen what he gave me, first lesson, Draught of Living Death -- never had a student produce finer on a first attempt, I don't think even you, Severus --\" \"Really?\" said Snape quietly, his eyes still boring into Harry, who felt a certain disquiet. The last thing he wanted was for Snape to start investigating the source of his newfound brilliance at Potions. \"Remind me what other subjects you're taking, Harry?\" asked Slughorn . \"Defense Against the D ark Arts, Charms, Transfiguration , Herbology...\" \"All the subjects required, in short, for an Auror ,\" said Snap e with the faintest sneer. \"Yeah, well, that's what I'd like to do,\" said Harry defiantly. \"And a great one you'll make too!\" boomed Slughorn. \"I don't think you should be an Auror, Harry,\" said Luna unex pectedly. Everybody looked at her. \"The Aurors are part of the Rotfang Conspiracy, I thought everyone knew that. They're planning to bring down the Ministry of Magic from within using a c om bination of Dark Magic and gum disease.\" Harry inhaled half his mead up his nose as he started to lau gh. Really, it had been worth bringing Luna just for this. Emerging, from his goblet, coughing, sopping wet but still grinning, he saw something calculated to raise his spirits even higher: Draco Malf o y being dragged by the ear toward them by Argus Filch. \"Professor Slughorn,\" wheezed Filch, his jowls aquiver and the maniacal light of mischief-detection in his bulging eyes, \"I discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor. He claims to have been invited to your party and to have been delayed in setting out. Did you issue him with an invitation?\" Malfoy pulled himself free of Filchs grip, looking furious. \"All right, I wasn't invited!\" he said angrily. \"I was trying to gate crash, happy?\" \"No, I'm not!\" said Filch, a statement at complete odds with the glee on his face. \"You're in trouble, you are! Didn't the headma ster say that nighttime prowling ' s out, unless you've got permission, didn't he, eh?\" \"That's all right, Argus, that's all right,\" said Slughorn, waving it 1.1 nd. \"It's Christmas, and it's not a crime to want to come to a party . Just this once, we'll forget any punishment; you may stay , Draco. Fil ich's expression of outraged disappointment was perfectly pre di c t able; but why, Harry wondered, watching him, did Malfoy look almost equally unhappy? And why was Snape looking at Mal-foy as though both angry and . . . was it p ossible? ... a lit tl afraid? But almost before Harry had registered what he had seen, Filch had turned and shuffled away, muttering under his breath; Malfoy h ad composed his face into a smile and was thanking Slughorn for his generosity, and Snape's face was smoothly inscrutable again. \"It's nothing, nothing,\" said Slughorn, waving away Malfoy's t hanks. \"I did know your grandfather, after all....\" \"He always spoke very highly of you, sir,\" said Malfoy quickly. \"Said you were the best potion-maker he'd ever known. ...\" Harry stared at Malfoy. It was not the sucking-up that intrigued him; he had watched Malfoy do that to Snape for a long time. It was the fact that Malfoy did, after all, look a little ill. This was the first time he had seen Malfoy close up for ages; he now saw that Malfoy had dark shadows under his eyes and a distinctly grayish tinge to his skin. \"I'd like a word with you, Draco,\" said Snape suddenly. \"Now , Severus,\" said Slughorn, hiccuping again, \"it's Christ mas, do n't be too hard --\" \"I am his Head of House, and I shall decide how hard, or other-wise, to be,\" said Snape curtly. \"Follow me, Draco.\" They left, Snape leading the way, Malfoy looking resentful. Harry stood there for a moment, irresolute, then said, \"I'll be back in a bit, Luna -- er -- bathroom.\" \"All right,\" she said cheerfully, and he thought he heard her, as he hurried off into the crowd, resume the subject of the Rotfang Conspiracy with Professor Trelawney, who seemed sincerely in terested. It was easy, once out of the party, to pull his Invisibility Cloak out of his pocket and throw it over himself, for the corridor was quite deserted. What was more difficult was finding Snape and Malfoy. Harry ran down the corridor, the noise of his feet masked by the music and loud talk still issuing from Slughorn's office behind him. Perhaps Snape had taken Malfoy to his office in the dungeons ... or perhaps he was escorting him back to the Slyt herin common room. . . . Harry pressed his ear against door after door as he dashed down the corridor until, with a great jolt of excitement, he crouched down to the keyhole of the last classroom in the corridor and heard voices. \" . . . cannot afford mistakes, Draco, because if you are expelled --\" \"I didn't have anything to do with it, all right?\" \"I hope you are telling the truth, because it was both clumsy a nd foolish. Already you are suspected of having a hand in it.\" \"Who suspects me?\" said Malfoy angrily. \"For the last time, I didn't do it, okay? That Bell girl must ' ve had an enemy no on e knows about -- don't look at me like that! I know what you're do-ing, I'm not stupid, but it won't work -- I can stop you!\" There was a pause and then Snape said quietly, \"Ah . . . Aunt Bellatrix has been teaching you Occlumency, I see. What thoughts are you trying to conceal from your master, Draco?\" \"I'm not trying to conceal anything from him, I just don't want you butting in !\" Harry pressed his ear still more closely against the keyhole. . . . What had happened to make Malfoy speak to Snape like this -- Snape, toward whom he had always shown respect, even liking? \"So that is why you have been avoiding me this term? You have feared my interference? You realize that, had anybody else failed to come to my office when I had told them repeatedly to be there, Draco --\" \"So put me in detention! Report me to Dumbledore!\" jeered Malfoy. There was another pause. Then Snape said, \"You know perfectly well that I do not wish to do either of those things .\" \"You'd better stop telling me to come to your office then!\" \"Listen to me,\" said Snape, his voice so low now that Harry had to push his ear very hard against the keyhole to hear. \"I am trying to help you. I swore to your mother I would protect you. I made the Unbreakable Vow, Draco --\" \"Looks like you'll have to break it, then, because I don't need your protection! It's my job, he gave it to me and I'm doing it, I've got a plan and it's going to work, it's just taking a bit longer than I thought it would!\" \"What is your plan ?\" \"It's none of your business !\" \" If you tell me what you are trying to do, I can assist you ...\" \"I have all the assistance I need, thanks, I'm not alone!\" \"You were certainly alone tonight, which was foolish in the ex-treme, wandering the corridors without lookouts or backup, these are elementary mistakes --\" \"I would've had Crabbe and Goyle with me if you hadn't put them in detention!\" \"Keep your voice down!\" spat Snape, for Malfoy ' s voice had risen excitedly. \"If your friends Crabbe and Goyle intend to pass their Defense Against the Dark Arts OWL this time around, they will need to work a little harder than they are doing at pres --\" \"What does it matter?\" said Malfoy. \"Defense Against the Dark Arts -- its all just a joke, isn't it, an act? Like any of us need pro-tecting against the Dark Arts --\" \"It is an act that is crucial to success, Draco!\" said Snape. \"Where do you think I would have been all these years, if I had not known how to act? Now listen to me! You are being incautious, wandering around at night, getting yourself caught, and if you are placing your reliance in assistants like Crabbe and Goyle --\" \"They're not the only ones, I've got other people on my side, better people!\" \"Then why not confide in me, and I can --\" \"I know what you're up to! You want to steal my glory!\" There was another pause, then Snape said coldly, \"You are speaking like a child. I quite understand that your fathers capture and imprisonment has upset you, but --\" Harry had barely a second ' s warning; he heard Malfoy's footsteps on the other side of the door and flung himself out of the way just as it burst open . Malfoy was striding away down the corridor, past the open door of Slughorns office, around the distant corner, and out of sight. Hardly daring to breathe, Harry remained crouched down as Snape emerged slowly from the classroom. His expression unfath-omable, he returned to the party. Harry remained on the floor, hid-den beneath the cloak, his mind racing. \n",

            "-Five King’s Cross He lay facedown, listening to the silence. He was perfectly alone. Nobody was watching. Nobody else was there. He was not perfectly sure that he was there himself. A long time later, or maybe no time at all, it came to him that he must exist, must be more than disembodied thought, because he was lying, definitely lying, on some surface. Therefore he had a sense of touch, and the thing against which he lay existed too. Almost as soon as he had reached this conclusion, Harry became conscious that he was naked. Convinced as he was of his total solitude, this did not concern him, but it did intrigue him slightly. He wondered whether, as he could feel, he would be able to see. In opening them, he discovered that he had eyes. He lay in a bright mist, though it was not like mist he had ever experienced before. His surroundings were not hidden by cloudy vapor; rather the cloudy vapor had not yet formed into surroundings. The floor on which he lay seemed to be white, neither warm nor cold, but simply there, a flat, blank something on which to be. He sat up. His body appeared unscathed. He touched his face. He was not wearing glasses anymore. Then a noise reached him through the unformed nothingness that surrounded him: the small soft thumpings of something that flapped, flailed, and struggled. It was a pitiful noise, yet also slightly indecent. He had the uncomfortable feeling that he was eavesdropping on something furtive, shameful. For the first time, he wished he were clothed. Barely had the wish formed in his head than robes appeared a short distance away. He took them and pulled them on. They were soft, clean, and warm. It was extraordinary how they had appeared just like that, the moment he had wanted them. . . . He stood up, looking around. Was he in some great Room of Requirement? The longer he looked, the more there was to see. A great domed glass roof glittered high above him in sunlight. Perhaps it was a palace. All was hushed and still, except for those odd thumping and whimpering noises coming from somewhere close by in the mist. . . . Harry turned slowly on the spot, and his surroundings seemed to invent themselves before his eyes. A wide-open space, bright and clean, a hall larger by far than the Great Hall, with that clear domed glass ceiling. It was quite empty. He was the only person there, except for - He recoiled. He had spotted the thing that was making the noises. It had the form of a small, naked child, curled on the ground, its skin raw and rough, flayed-looking, and it lay shuddering under a seat where it had been left, unwanted, stuffed out of sight, struggling for breath. He was afraid of it. Small and fragile and wounded though it was, he did not want to approach it. Nevertheless he drew slowly nearer, ready to jump back at any moment. Soon he stood near enough to touch it, yet he could not bring himself to do it. He felt like a coward. He ought to comfort it, but it repulsed him. \"You cannot help.\" He spun around. Albus Dumbledore was walking toward him, sprightly and upright, wearing sweeping robes of midnight blue. \"Harry.\" He spread his arms wide, and his hands were both whole and white and undamaged. \"You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk.\" Stunned, Harry followed as Dumbledore strode away from where the flayed child lay whimpering, leading him to two seats that Harry had not previously noticed, set some distance away under that high, sparkling ceiling. Dumbledore sat down in one of them, and Harry fell into the other, staring at his old headmaster’s face. Dumbledore’s long silver hair and beard, the piercingly blue eyes behind half-moon spectacles, the crooked nose: Everything was as he had remembered it. And yet . . . \"But you’re dead,\" said Harry. \"Oh yes,\" said Dumbledore matter-of-factly. \"Then . . . I’m dead too?\" \"Ah,\" said Dumbledore, smiling still more broadly. \"That is the question, isn’t it? On the whole, dear boy, I think not.\" They looked at each other, the old man still beaming. \"Not?\" repeated Harry. \"Not,\" said Dumbledore. \"But . . .\" Harry raised his hand instinctively toward the lightning scar. It did not seem to be there. \"But I should have died - I didn’t defend myself! I meant to let him kill me!\" \"And that,\" said Dumbledore, \"will, I think, have made all the difference.\" Happiness seemed to radiate from Dumbledore like light; like fire: Harry had never seen the man so utterly, so palpably content. \"Explain,\" said Harry. \"But you already know,\" said Dumbledore. He twiddled his thumbs together. \"I let him kill me,\" said Harry. \"Didn’t I?\" \"You did,\" said Dumbledore, nodding. \"Go on!\" \"So the part of his soul that was in me . . .\" Dumbledore nodded still more enthusiastically, urging Harry onward, a broad smile of encouragement on his face. \". . . has it gone?\" \"Oh yes!\" said Dumbledore. \"Yes, he destroyed it. Your soul is whole, and completely your own, Harry.\" \"But then . . .\" Harry trembled over his shoulder to where the small, maimed creature trembled under the chair. \"What is that, Professor?\" \"something that is beyond either of our help,\" said Dumbledore. \"But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,\" Harry started again, \"and nobody died for me this time - how can I be alive?\" \"I think you know,\" said Dumbledore. \"Think back. Remember what he did, in his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.\" Harry thought. He let his gaze drift over his surroundings. If it was indeed a palace in which they sat, it was an odd one, with chairs set in little rows and bits of railing here and there, and still, he and Dumbledore and the stunted creatures under the chair were the only beings there. Then the answer rose to his lips easily, without effort. \"He took my blood,\" said Harry. \"Precisely!\" said Dumbledore. \"He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily’s protection inside both of you! He thethered you to life while he lives!\" \"I live . . . while he lives? But I thought . . . I thought it was the other way around! I thought we both had to die? Or is it the same thing?\" He was distracted by the whimpering and thumping of the agonized creature behind them and glanced back at it yet again. \"Are you sure we can’t do anything?\" \"There is no help possible.\" \"Then explain . . . more,\" said Harry, and Dumbledore smiled. \"You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry, the Horcrux he never meant to make. He had rendered his soul so unstable that it broke apart when he committed those acts of unspeakable evil, the murder of your parents, the attempted killing of a child. But what escaped from that room was even less than he knew. He left more than his body behind. He left part of himself latched to you, the would-be victim who had survived. \"And his knowledge remained woefully incomplete, Harry! That which Voldemort does not value, he takes no trouble to comprehend. Of house-elves and children’s tales, of love, loyalty, and innocence, Voldemort knows and understands nothing. Nothing. That they all have a power beyond his own, a power beyond the reach of any magic, is a truth he has never grasped. \"He took your blood believing it would strengthen him. He took into his body a tiny part of the enchantment your mother laid upon you when she died for you. His body keeps her sacrafice alive, and while that enchantment survives, so do you and so does Voldemort’s one last hope for himself.\" Dumbledore smiled at Harry, and Harry stared at him. \"And you knew this? You knew - all along?\" \"I guessed. But my guesses have usually been good,\" said Dumbledore happily, and they sat in silence for what seemed like a long time, while the creature behind them continued to whimper and tremble. \"There’s more,\" said Harry. \"There’s more to it. Why did my wand break the wand he borrowed?\" \"As to that, I cannot be sure.\" \"Have a guess, then,\" said Harry, and Dumbledore laughed. \"What you must understand, Harry, is that you and Lord Voldemort have journeyed together into realms of magic hitherto unknown and untested. But here is what I think happened, and it is unprecedented, and no wandmaker could, I think, ever have predicted or explained it to Voldemort. \"Without meaning to, as you now know, Lord Voldemort doubled the bond between you when he returned to a human form. A part of his soul was still attached to yours, and, thinking to strengthen himself, he took a part of your mother’s sacrafice into himself. If he could only have understood the precise and terrible power of that sacrifice, he would not, perhaps, have dared to touch your blood. . . . But then, if he had been able to understand, he could not be Lord Voldemort, and might never have murdered at all. \"Having ensured this two-fold connection, having wrapped your destinies together more securely than ever two wizards were joined in history, Voldemort proceeded to attack you with a wand that shared a core with yours. And now something very strange happened, as we know. The cores reacted in a way that Lord Voldemort, who never knew that your wand was a twin of his, had ever expected. \"He was more afraid than you were that night, Harry. You had accepted, even embraced, the possibility of death, something Lord Voldemort has never been able to do. Your courage won, your wand overpowered his. And in doing so, something happened between those wands, something that echoed the relationship between their masters. \"I believe that your wand imbibed some of the power and qualities of Voldemort’s wand that night, which is to say that it contained a little of Voldemort himself. So your wand recognized him when he pursued you, recognized a man who was both kin and mortal enemy, and it regurgitated some of his own magic against him, magic much more powerful than anything Lucius’s wand had ever performed. Your wand now contained the power of your enormous courage and of Voldemort’s own deadly skill: What chance did that poor stick of Lucius Malfoy’s stand?\" \"But if my wand was so powerful, how come Hermione was able to break it?\" asked Harry. \"My dear boy, its remarkable effects were directed only at Voldemort, who had tampered so ill-advisedly with the deepest laws of magic. Only toward him was that wand abnormally powerful. Otherwise it was a wand like any other . . . though a good one, I am sure,\" Dumbledore finished kindly. Harry sat in thought for a long time, or perhaps seconds. It was very hard to be sure of things like time, here. \"He killed me with your wand.\" \"He failed to kill you with my wand,\" Dumbledore corrected Harry. \"I think we can agree that you are not dead - though, of course,\" he added, as if fearing he had been discourteous, \"I do not minimize your sufferings, which I am sure were severe.\" \"I feel great at the moment, though,\" said Harry, looking down at his clean, unblemished hands. \"Where are we, exactly?\" \"Well, I was going to ask you that,\" said Dumbledore, looking around. \"Where would you say that we are?\" Until Dumbledore had asked, Harry had not known. Now, however, he found that he had an answer ready to give. \"It looks,\" he said slowly, \"like King’s Cross station. Except a lo cleaner and empty, and there are no trains as far as I can see.\" \"King’s Cross station!\" Dumbledore was chuckling immoderately. \"Good gracious, really?\" \"Well, where do you think we are?\" asked Harry, a little defensively. \"My dear boy, I have no idea. This is, as they say, your party.\" Harry had no idea what this meant; Dumbledore was being infuriating. He glared at him, then remembered a much more pressing question than that of their current location. \"The Deathly Hallows,\" he said, and he was glad to see that the words wiped the smile from Dumbledore’s face. \"Ah, yes,\" he said. He even looked a little worried. \"Well?\" For the first time since Harry had met Dumbledore, he looked less than an old man, much less. He looked fleetingly like a small boy caught in wrongdoing. \"Can you forgive me?\" he said. \"Can you forgive me for not trusting you? For not telling you? Harry, I only feared that you would fail as I had failed. I only dreaded that you would make my mistakes. I crave your pardon, Harry. I have known, for some time now, that you are the better man.\" \"What are you talking about?\" asked Harry, startled by Dumbledore’s tone, by the sudden tears in his eyes. \"The Hallows, the Hallows,\" murmured Dumbledore. \"A desperate man’s dream!\" \"But they’re real!\" \"Real, and dangerous, and a lure for fools,\" said Dumbledore. \"And I was such a fool. But you know, don’t you? I have no secrets from you anymore. You know.\" \"What do I know?\" Dumbledore turned his whole body to face Harry, and tears still sparkled in the brilliantly blue eyes. \"Master of death, Harry, master of Death! Was I better, ultimately, than Voldemort?\" \"Of course you were,\" said Harry. \"Of course - how can you ask that? You never killed if you could avoid it!\" \"True, true,\" said Dumbledore, and he was like a child seeking reassurance. \"Yet I too sought a way to conquer death, Harry.\" \"Not the way he did,\" said Harry. After all his anger at Dumbledore, how odd it was to sit here, beneath the high, vaulted ceiling, and defend Dumbledore from himself. \"Hallows, not Horcruxes.\" \"Hallows,\" murmured Dumbledore, \"not Horcruxes. Precisely.\" There was a pause. The creature behind them whimpered, but Harry no longer looked around. \"Grindelwald was looking for them too?\" he asked. Dumbledore closed his eyes for a moment and nodded. \"It was the thing, above all, that drew us together,\" he said quietly. \"Two clever, arrogant boys with a shared obsession. He wanted to come to Godric’s Hollow, as I am sure you have guessed, because of the grave of Ignotus Peverell. He wanted to explore the place the third brother had died.\" \"So it’s true?\" asked Harry. \"All of it? The Peverell brothers -\" \"-were the three brothers of the tale,\" said Dumbledore, nodding. \"Oh yes, I think so. Whether they met Death on a lonely road . . . I think it more likely that the Peverell brothers were simply gifted, dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those powerful objects. The story of them being Death’s own Hallows seems to me the sort of legend that might have sprung up around such creations. \"The Cloak, as you know now, traveled down through the ages, father to son, mother to daughter, right down to Ignotus’s last living descendant, who was born, as Ignotus was, in the village of Godric’s Hollow.\" Dumbledore smiled at Harry. \"Me?\" \"You. You have guessed,, I know, why the Cloak was in my possession on the night your parents died. James had showed it to me just a few days previously. It explained much of his undetected wrongdoing at school! I could hardly believe what I was seeing. I asked to borrow it, to examine it. I had long since given up my dream of uniting the Hallows, but I could not resist, could not help taking a closer look. . . . It was a Cloak the likes of which I had never seen, immensely old, perfect in every respect . . . and then your father died, and I had two Hallows at last, all to myself!\" His tone was unbearably bitter. \"The Cloak wouldn’t have helped them survive, though,\" Harry said quickly. \"Voldemort knew where my mum and dad were. The Cloak couldn’t have made them curse-proof.\" \"true,\" sighed Dumbledore. \"True.\" Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not speak, so he prompted him. \"So you’d given up looking for the Hallows when you saw the Cloak?\" \"Oh yes,\" said Dumbledore faintly. It seemed that he forced himself to meet Harry’s eyes. \"You know what happened. You know. You cannot despise me more than I despise myself.\" \"But I don’t despise you -\" \"Then you should,\" said Dumbledore. He drew a deep breath. \"You know the secret of my sister’s ill health, what those Muggles did, what she became. You know how my poor father sought revenge, and paid the price, died In Azkaban. You know how my mother gave up her own life to care for Ariana. \"I resented it, Harry.\" Dumbledore stated it baldly, coldly. He was looking now over the top of Harry’s head, into the distance. \"I was gifted, I was brilliant. I wanted to escape. I wanted to shine. I wanted glory. \"Do not misunderstand me,\" he said, and pain crossed the face so that he looked ancient again. \"I loved them, I loved my parents, I loved my brother and my sister, but I was selfish, Harry, more selfish than you, who are a remarkably selfless person, could possibly imagine. \"So that, when my mother died, and I was left the responsibility of a damaged sister and a wayward brother, I returned to my village in anger and bitterness. Trapped and wasted, I thought! And then of course, he came. . . .\" Dumbledore looked directly into Harry’s eyes again. \"Grindelwald. You cannot imagine how his ideas caught me, Harry, inflamed me. Muggles forced into subservience. We wizards triumphant. Grindelwald and I, the glorious young leaders of the revolution. \"Oh, I had a few scruples. I assuaged my conscience with empty words. It would all be for the greater good, and any harm done would be repaid a hundredfold in benefits for wizards. Did I know, in my heart of hearts, what Gellert Grindelwald was? I think I did, but I closed my eyes. If the plans we were making came to fruition, all my dreams would come true. \"And at the heart of our schemes, the Deathly Hallows! How they fascinated him, how they fascinated both of us! The unbeatable wand, the weapon that would lead us to power! The Resurrection Stone - to him, though I pretended not to know it, it meant an army of Inferi! To me, I confess, it meant the return of my parents, and the lifting of all responsibility from my shoulders. \"And the Cloak . . . somehow, we never discussed the Cloak much, Harry. Both of us could conceal ourselves well enough without the Cloak, the true magic of which, of course, is that it can be used to protect and shield others as well as its owner. I thought that, if we ever found it, it might be useful in hiding Ariana, but our interest in the Cloak was mainly that it completed the trio, for the legend said that the man who had united all three objects would then be truly master of death, which we took to mean ‘invincible.’ \"Invincible masters of death, Grindelwald and Dumbledore! Two months of insanity, of cruel dreams, and neglect of the only two members of my family left to me. \"And then . . . you know what happened. Reality returned in the form of my rough, unlettered, and infinitely more admirable brother. I did not want to hear the truths he shouted at me. I did not want to hear that I could not set forth and seek Hallows with a fragile and unstable sister in tow. \"The argument became a fight. Grindelwald lost control. That which I had always sensed in him, though I pretended not to, now sprang into terrible being. And Ariana . . . after all my mother’s care and caution . . . lay dead upon the floor.\" Dumbledore gave a little gasp and began to cry in earnest. Harry reached out and was glad to find that he could touch him: He gripped his arm tightly and Dumbledore gradually regained control. \"Well, Grindelwald fled, as anyone but I could have predicted. He vanished, with his plans for seizing power, and his schemes for Muggle torture, and his dreams of the Deathly Hallows, dreams in which I had encouraged him and helped him. He ran, while I was left to bury my sister, and learn to live with my guilt and my terrible grief, the price of my shame. \"Years passed. There were rumors about him. They said he had procured a wand of immense power. I, meanwhile, was offered the post of Minister of Magic, not once, but several times. Naturally, I refused. I had learned that I was not to be trusted with power.\" \"But you’d have been better, much better, than Fudge or Scimgeour!\" burst out Harry. \"Would I?\" asked Dumbledore heavily. \"I am not so sure. I had proven, as a very young man, that power was my weakness and my temptation. It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those who, like you, have leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle because they must, and find to their own surprise that they wear it well. \"I was safer at Hogwarts. I think I was a good teacher -\" \"You were the best ---\" \"--- you are very kind, Harry. But while I busied myself with the training of young wizards, Grindelwald was raising an army. They say he feared me, and perhaps he did, but less, I think, than I feared him. \"Oh, not death,\" said Dumbledore, in answer to Harry’s questioning look. \"Not what he could do to me magically. I knew that we were evenly matched, perhaps that I was a shade more skillful. It was the truth I feared. You see, I never knew which of us, in that last, horrific fight, had actually cast the curse that killed my sister. You may call me cowardly: You would be right, Harry. I dreaded beyond all things the knowledge that it had been I who brought about her death, not merely through my arrogance and stupidity, but that I actually struck the blow that snuffed out her life. \"I think he knew it, I think he knew what frightened me. I delayed meeting him until finally, it would have been too shameful to resist any longer. People were dying and he seemed unstoppable, and I had to do what I could. \"Well, you know what happened next. I won the duel. I won the wand.\" Another silence. Harry did not ask whether Dumbledore had ever found out who struck Ariana dead. He did not want to know, and even less did he want Dumbledore to have to tell him. At last he knew what Dumbledore would have seen when he looked in the mirror of Erised, and why Dumbledore had been so understanding of the fascination it had exercised over Harry. They sat in silence for a long time, and the whipmerings of the creature behind them barely disturbed Harry anymore. At last he said, \"Grindelwald tried to stop Voldemort going after the wand. He lied, you know, pretended he had never had it.\" Dumbledore nodded, looking down at his lap, tears still glittering on the crooked nose. \"They say he showed remorse in later years, alone in his cell at Nurmengard. I hope that is true. I would like to think that he did feel the horror and shame of what he had done. Perhaps that lie to Voldemort was his attempt to make amends . . . to prevent Voldemort from taking the Hallow . . .\" \". . .or maybe from breaking into your tomb?\" suggested Harry, and Dumbledore dabbed his eyes. After another short pause Harry said, \"You tried to use the Resurrection Stone.\" Dumbledore nodded. \"When I discovered it, after all those years, buried in the abandoned home of the Gaunts --- the Hallow I had craved most of all, though in my youth I had wanted it for very different reasons --- I lost my head, Harry. I quite forgot that I was not a Horcrux, that the ring was sure to carry a curse. I picked it up, and I put it on, and for a second I imagined that I was about to see Ariana, and my mother, and my father, and to tell them how very, very sorry, I was. . . . \"I was such a fool, Harry. After all those years I had learned nothing. I was unworthy to unite the Deathly Hallows, I had proved it time and again, and here was final proof.\" \"Why?\" said Harry. \"It was natural! You wanted to see them again. What’s wrong with that?\" \"Maybe a man in a million could unite the Hallows, Harry. I was fit only to possess the meanest of them, the least extraordinary. I was fit to own the Elder Wand, and not boast of it, and not to kill with it. I was permitted to tame and use it, because I took it, not for gain, but to save others from it. \"But the Cloak, I took out of vain curiousity, and so it could never have worked for me as it works for you, its true owners. The stone I would have used in an attempt to drag back those who are at peace, rather than enable my self-sacrafice, as you did. You are the worthy possessor of the Hallows.\" Dumbledore patted Harry’s hand, and Harry looked up at the old man and smiled; he could not help himself. How coul dhe remain angry with Dumbledore now? \"Why did you have to make it so difficult?\" Dumbledore’s smile was tremulous. \"I am afraid I counted on Miss Granger to slow you up, Harry. I was afraid that your hot head might dominate your good heart. I was scared that, if presented outright with the facts about those tempting objects, you might seize the Hallows as I did, at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons. If you laid hands on them, I wanted you to possess them safely. You are the true master of death, because the true master does not seek to run away from Death. He accepts that he must die, and understands that there are far, far worse things in the living world than dying.\" \"And Voldemort never knew about the Hallows?\" \"I do not think so, because he did not recognize the Resurrection Stone he turned into a Horcrux. But even if he had known about them, Harry. I doubt that he woul dhave been interested in any except the first. He would not think that he needed the Cloak, and as for the stone, whom would he want to bring back from the dead? He fears the dead. He does not love.\" \"But you expected him to go after the wand?\" \"I have been sure that he would try, ever since your wand beat Voldemort’s in the graveyard of Little Hangleton. At first, he was afraid that you had conquered him by superior skill. Once he had kidnapped Ollivander, however, he discovered the existence of the twin cores. He thought that explained everything. Yet the borrowed wand did no better against yours! So Voldemort, instead of asking himself what quality it was in you that had made your wand so strong, what gift you possessed that he did not, naturally set out to find the one wand that, they said, would beat any other. For him, the Elder Wand has become an obsession to rival his obsession with you. He believes that the Elder Wand removes his last weakness and makes him truly invincible. Poor Severus . . .\" \"If you planned your death with Snape, you meant him to end up with the Elder Wand, didn’t you?\" \"I admit that was my intention,\" said Dumbledore, \"but it did not work as I intended, did it?\" \"No,\" said Harry. \"That bit didn’t work out.\" The creature behind them jerked and moaned, and Harry and Dumbledore sate without talking for the longest time yet. The realization of what would happen next settled gradually over Harry in the long minutes, like softly falling snow. \"I’ve got to go back, haven’t I?\" \"That is up to you.\" \"I’ve got a choice?\" \"Oh yes,\" Dumbledore smiled at him. \"We are in King’s Cross you say? I think that if you decided not to go back, you would be able to . . . let’s say . . . board a train.\" \"And where would it take me?\" \"On,\" said Dumbledore simply. Silence again. \"Voldemort’s got the Elder Wand.\" \"True. Voldemort has the Elder Wand.\" \"But you want me to go back?\" \"I think,\" said Dumbledore, \"that if you choose to return, there is a chance that he may be finished for good. I cannot promise it. But I know this, Harry, that you have less to fear from returning here than he does.\" Harry glanced again at the raw looking thing that trembled and choked in the shadow beneath the distant chair. \"Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and above all, those who live without love. By returning, you may ensure that fewer souls are maimed, fewer families are torn apart. If that seems to you a worthy goal, they we saw good-bye for the present.\" Harry nodded and sighed. Leaving this place would not be nearly as hard as walking into the forest had been, but it was warm and light and peaceful here, and he knew that he was heading back to pain and the fear of more loss. He stood up, and Dumbledore did the same, and they looked for a long moment into each other’s faces. \"Tell me one last thing,\" said Harry, \"Is this real? Or has this been happening inside my head?\" Dumbledore beamed at him, and his voice sounded loud and strong in Harry’s ears even though the bright mist was descending again, obscuring his figure. \"Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean it is not real?\" \n",

            ": The Hour of Gaunt For or the rest of the week's Potions lessons Harry continued to follow the Half-Blood Prince's instructions wherever they deviated from Libatius Borage's, with the result that by their fourth lesson Slughorn was raving about Harrys abilities, saying that he had rarely taught anyone so talented. Neither Ron nor Hermione was delighted by this. Although Harry had offered to share his book with both of them, Ron had more difficulty deciphering the handwriting than Harry did, and could not keep asking Harry to read aloud or it might look suspicious. Hermione, meanwhile, was resolutely plowing on with what she called the \"official\" instructions, but becoming increasingly bad-tempered as they yielded poorer results than the Prince's. Harry wondered vaguely who the Half-Blood Prince had been. Although the amount of homework they had been given prevented him from reading the whole of his copy of Advanced Potion-Making, he had skimmed through it sufficiently to see that there was barely a page on which the Prince had not made additional notes, not all of them concerned with potion-making. Here and there were directions for what looked like spells that the Prince had made up himself. \"Or herself,\" said Hermione irritably, overhearing Harry pointing some of these out to Ron in the common room on Saturday evening. \"It might have been a girl. I think the handwriting looks more like a girl's than a boy's.\" \"The Half-Blood Prince, he was called,\" Harry said. \"How many girls have been Princes?\" Hermione seemed to have no answer to this. She merely scowled and twitched her essay on The Principles of Rematerialization away from Ron, who was trying to read it upside down. Harry looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old copy of Advanced Potion-Making back into his bag. \"It's five to eight, I'd better go, I'll be late for Dumbledore.\" \"Ooooh!\" gasped Hermione, looking up at once. \"Good luck! We'll wait up, we want to hear what he teaches you!\" \"Hope it goes okay,\" said Ron, and the pair of them watched Harry leave through the portrait hole. Harry proceeded through deserted corridors, though he had to step hastily behind a statue when Professor Trelawney appeared around a corner, muttering to herself as she shuffled a pack of dirty-looking playing cards, reading them as she walked. \"Two of spades: conflict,\" she murmured, as she passed the place where Harry crouched, hidden. \"Seven of spades: an ill omen. Ten of spades: violence. Knave of spades: a dark young man, possibly troubled, one who dislikes the questioner --\" She stopped dead, right on the other side of Harry's statue. \"Well, that can't be right,\" she said, annoyed, and Harry heard her reshuffling vigorously as she set off again, leaving nothing but a whiff of cooking sherry behind her. Harry waited until he was quite sure she had gone, then hurried off again until he reached the spot in the seventh-floor corridor where a single gargoyle stood against the wall. \"Acid Pops,\" said Harry, and the gargoyle leapt aside; the wall behind it slid apart, and a moving spiral stone staircase was revealed, onto which Harry stepped, so that he was carried in smooth circles up to the door with the brass knocker that led to Dumbledore's Office. Harry knocked. \"Come in,\" said Dumbledore s voice. \"Good evening, sir,\" said Harry, walking into the headmaster's office. \"Ah, good evening, Harry. Sit down,\" said Dumbledore, smiling. \"I hope you've had an enjoyable first week back at school?\" \"Yes, thanks, sir,\" said Harry. \"You must have been busy, a detention under your belt already!\" \"Er,\" began Harry awkwardly, but Dumbledore did not look too stern. \"I have arranged with Professor Snape that you will do your detention next Saturday instead.\" \"Right,\" said Harry, who had more pressing matters on his mind than Snapes detention, and now looked around surreptitiously for some indication of what Dumbledore was planning to do with him this evening. The circular office looked just as it always did; the delicate silver instruments stood on spindle-legged tables, puff-ing smoke and whirring; portraits of previous headmasters and headmistresses dozed in their frames, and Dumbledore's magnificent phoenix, Fawkes, stood on his perch behind the door, watching Harry with bright interest. It did not even look as though Dumbledore had cleared a space for dueling practice. \"So, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, in a businesslike voice. \"You have been wondering, I am sure, what I have planned for you during these -- for want of a better word -- lessons?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Well, I have decided that it is time, now that you know what prompted Lord Voldemort to try and kill you fifteen years ago, for you to be given certain information.\" There was a pause. \"You said, at the end of last term, you were going to tell me everything,\" said Harry. It was hard to keep a note of accusation from his voice. \"Sir,\" he added. \"And so I did,\" said Dumbledore placidly. \"I told you everything I know. From this point forth, we shall be leaving the firm foundation of fact and journeying together through the murky marshes of memory into thickets of wildest guesswork. From here on in, Harry, I may be as woefully wrong as Humphrey Belcher, who believed the time was ripe for a cheese cauldron.\" \"But you think you're right?\" said Harry. \"Naturally I do, but as I have already proven to you, I make mistakes like the next man. In fact, being -- forgive me -- rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.\" \"Sir,\" said Harry tentatively, \"does what you're going to tell me have anything to do with the prophecy? Will it help me . . . survive?\" \"It has a very great deal to do with the prophecy,\" said Dumbledore, as casually as if Harry had asked him about the next days weather, \"and I certainly hope that it will help you to survive.\" Dumbledore got to his feet and walked around the desk, past Harry, who turned eagerly in his seat to watch Dumbledore bending over the cabinet beside the door. When Dumbledore straightened up, he was holding a familiar shallow stone basin etched with odd markings around its rim. He placed the Pensieve on the desk in front of Harry. \"You look worried.\" Harry had indeed been eyeing the Pensieve with some apprehension. His previous experiences with the odd device that stored and revealed thoughts and memories, though highly instructive, had also been uncomfortable. The last time he had disturbed its contents, he had seen much more than he would have wished. But Dumbledore was smiling. \"This time, you enter the Pensieve with me . . . and, even more unusually, with permission.\" \"Where are we going, sir?\" \"For a trip down Bob Ogden's memory lane,\" said Dumbledore, pulling from his pocket a crystal bottle containing a swirling silvery-white substance. \"Who was Bob Ogden?\" \"He was employed by the Department of Magical Law Enforcement,\" said Dumbledore. \"He died some time ago, but not before I had tracked him down and persuaded him to confide these recollections to me. We are about to accompany him on a visit he made in the course of his duties. If you will stand, Harry ...\" But Dumbledore was having difficulty pulling out the stopper of the crystal bottle: His injured hand seemed stiff and painful. \"Shall --shall I, sir?\" \"No matter, Harry --\" Dumbledore pointed his wand at the bottle and the cork flew out. \"Sir -- how did you injure your hand?\" Harry asked again, looking at the blackened fingers with a mixture of revulsion and pity. \"Now is not the moment for that story, Harry. Not yet. We have an appointment with Bob Ogden.\" Dumbledore tipped the silvery contents of the bottle into the Pensieve, where they swirled and shimmered, neither liquid nor gas. \"After you,\" said Dumbledore, gesturing toward the bowl. Harry bent forward, took a deep breath, and plunged his face into the silvery substance. He felt his feet leave the office floor; he was falling, falling through whirling darkness and then, quite sud-denly, he was blinking in dazzling sunlight. Before his eyes had adjusted, Dumbledore landed beside him. They were standing in a country lane bordered by high, tangled hedgerows, beneath a summer sky as bright and blue as a forget-me-not. Some ten feet in front of them stood a short, plump man wearing enormously thick glasses that reduced his eyes to molelike specks. He was reading a wooden signpost that was sticking out of the brambles on the left-hand side of the road. Harry knew this must be Ogden; he was the only person in sight, and he was also wearing the strange assortment of clothes so often chosen by inexperienced wizards trying to look like Muggles: in this case, a frock coat and spats over a striped one-piece bathing costume. Before Harry had time to do more than register his bizarre appearance, however, Ogden had set off at a brisk walk down the lane. Dumbledore and Harry followed. As they passed the wooden sign, Harry looked up at its two arms. The one pointing back the way they had come read: Great Hangleton, 5 miles. The arm pointing after Ogden said Little Hangleton, 1 mile. They walked a short way with nothing to see but the hedgerows, the wide blue sky overhead and the swishing, frock-coated figure ahead. Then the lane curved to the left and fell away, sloping steeply down a hillside, so that they had a sudden, unexpected view of a whole valley laid out in front of them. Harry could see a village, undoubtedly Little Hangleton, nestled between two steep hills, its church and graveyard clearly visible. Across the valley, set on the opposite hillside, was a handsome manor house surrounded by a wide expanse of velvety green lawn. Ogden had broken into a reluctant trot due to the steep downward slope. Dumbledore lengthened his stride, and Harry hurried to keep up. He thought Little Hangleton must be their final destination and wondered, as he had done on the night they had found Slughorn, why they had to approach it from such a distance. He soon discovered that he was mistaken in thinking that they were going to the village, however. The lane curved to the right and when they rounded the corner, it was to see the very edge of Ogden's frock coat vanishing through a gap in the hedge. Dumbledore and Harry followed him onto a narrow dirt track bordered by higher and wilder hedgerows than those they had left behind. The path was crooked, rocky, and potholed, sloping down-hill like the last one, and it seemed to be heading for a patch of dark trees a little below them. Sure enough, the track soon opened up at the copse, and Dumbledore and Harry came to a halt behind Ogden, who had stopped and drawn his wand. Despite the cloudless sky, the old trees ahead cast deep, dark, cool shadows, and it was a few seconds before Harry's eyes discerned the building half-hidden amongst the tangle of trunks. It seemed to him a very strange location to choose for a house, or else an odd decision to leave the trees growing nearby, blocking all light and the view of the valley below. He wondered whether it was inhabited; its walls were mossy and so many tiles had fallen off the roof that the rafters were visible in places. Nettles grew all around it, their tips reaching the windows, which were tiny and thick with grime. Just as he had concluded that nobody could possibly live there, however, one of the windows was thrown open with a clatter, and a thin trickle of steam or smoke issued from it, as though somebody was cooking. Ogden moved forward quietly and, it seemed to Harry, rather cautiously. As the dark shadows of the trees slid over him, he stopped again, staring at the front door, to which somebody had nailed a dead snake. Then there was a rustle and a crack, and a man in rags dropped from the nearest tree, landing on his feet right in front of Ogden, who leapt backward so fast he stood on the tails of his frock coat and stumbled. \"You're not welcome.\" The man standing before them had thick hair so matted with dirt it could have been any color. Several of his teeth were missing. His eyes were small and dark and stared in opposite directions. He might have looked comical, but he did not; the effect was frighten-ing, and Harry could not blame Ogden for backing away several more paces before he spoke. \"Er -- good morning. I'm from the Ministry of Magic --\" \"You're not welcome.\" \"Er -- I'm sorry -- I don't understand you,\" said Ogden nervously. Harry thought Ogden was being extremely dim; the stranger was making himself very clear in Harry's opinion, particularly as he was brandishing a wand in one hand and a short and rather bloody knife in the other. \"You understand him, I'm sure, Harry?\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"Yes, of course,\" said Harry, slightly nonplussed. \"Why can't Ogden -- ?\" But as his eyes found the dead snake on the door again, he suddenly understood. \"He's speaking Parseltongue?\" \"Very good,\" said Dumbledore, nodding and smiling. The man in rags was now advancing on Ogden, knife in one hand, wand in the other. \"Now, look --\" Ogden began, but too late: There was a bang, and Ogden was on the ground, clutching his nose, while a nasty yellowish goo squirted from between his fingers. \"Morfin!\" said a loud voice. An elderly man had come hurrying out of the cottage, banging the door behind him so that the dead snake swung pathetically. This man was shorter than the first, and oddly proportioned; his shoulders were very broad and his arms overlong, which, with his bright brown eyes, short scrubby hair, and wrinkled face, gave him the look of a powerful, aged monkey. He came to a halt beside the man with the knife, who was now cackling with laughter at the sight of Ogden on the ground. \"Ministry, is it?\" said the older man, looking down at Ogden. \"Correct!\" said Ogden angrily, dabbing his face. \"And you, I take it, are Mr. Gaunt?\" \"S'right,\" said Gaunt. \"Got you in the face, did he?\" \"Yes, he did!\" snapped Ogden. \"Should've made your presence known, shouldn't you?\" said Gaunt aggressively. \"This is private property. Can't just walk in here and not expect my son to defend himself.\" \"Defend himself against what, man?\" said Ogden, clambering back to his feet. \"Busybodies. Intruders. Muggles and filth.\" Ogden pointed his wand at his own nose, which was still issuing large amounts of what looked like yellow pus, and the flow stopped at once. Mr. Gaunt spoke out of the corner of his mouth to Morfin. \"Get in the house. Don't argue.\" This time, ready for it, Harry recognized Parseltongue; even while he could understand what was being said, he distinguished the weird hissing noise that was all Ogden could hear. Morfin seemed to be on the point of disagreeing, but when his father cast him a threatening look he changed his mind, lumbering away to the cottage with an odd rolling gait and slamming the front door behind him, so that the snake swung sadly again. \"It's your son I'm here to see, Mr. Gaunt,\" said Ogden, as he mopped the last of the pus from the front of his coat. \"That was Morfin, wasn't it?\" \"Ah, that was Morfin,\" said the old man indifferently. \"Are you pure-blood?\" he asked, suddenly aggressive. \"That's neither here nor there,\" said Ogden coldly, and Harry felt his respect for Ogden rise. Apparently Gaunt felt rather differently. He squinted into Ogden’s face and muttered, in what was clearly supposed to be an offensive tone, \"Now I come to think about it, I've seen noses like yours down in the village.\" \"I don't doubt it, if your son’s been let loose on them,\" said Ogden. \"Perhaps we could continue this discussion inside?\" \"Inside?\" \"Yes, Mr. Gaunt. I've already told you. I'm here about Morfin. We sent an owl --\" \"I've no use for owls,\" said Gaunt. \"I don't open letters.\" \"Then you can hardly complain that you get no warning of visitors,\" said Ogden tartly. \"I am here following a serious breach of Wizarding law, which occurred here in the early hours of this morning --\" \"All right, all right, all right!\" bellowed Gaunt. \"Come in the bleeding house, then, and much good it'll do you!\" The house seemed to contain three tiny rooms. Two doors led off the main room, which served as kitchen and living room com-bined. Morfin was sitting in a filthy armchair beside the smoking fire, twisting a live adder between his thick fingers and crooning softly at it in Parseltongue: Hissy, hissy, little snakey, Slither on the floor You be good to Morfin Or he'll nail you to the door. There was a scuffling noise in the corner beside the open window, and Harry realized that there was somebody else in the room, a girl whose ragged gray dress was the exact color of the dirty stone wall behind her. She was standing beside a steaming pot on a grimy black stove, and was fiddling around with the shelf of squalid-looking pots and pans above it. Her hair was lank and dull and she had a plain, pale, rather heavy face. Her eyes, like her brother's, stared in opposite directions. She looked a little cleaner than the two men, but Harry thought he had never seen a more defeated-looking person. \"M'daughter, Merope,\" said Gaunt grudgingly, as Ogden looked inquiringly toward her. \"Good morning,\" said Ogden. She did not answer, but with a frightened glance at her father turned her back on the room and continued shifting the pots on the shelf behind her. \"Well, Mr. Gaunt,\" said Ogden, \"to get straight to the point, we have reason to believe that your son, Morfin, performed magic in front of a Muggle late last night.\" There was a deafening clang. Merope had dropped one of the pots. \"Pick it up!\" Gaunt bellowed at her. \"That's it, grub on the floor like some filthy Muggle, what's your wand for, you useless sack of muck?\" \"Mr. Gaunt, please!\" said Ogden in a shocked voice, as Merope, who had already picked up the pot, flushed blotchily scarlet, lost her grip on the pot again, drew her wand shakily from her pocket, pointed it at the pot, and muttered a hasty, inaudible spell that caused the pot to shoot across the floor away from her, hit the opposite wall, and crack in two. Morfin let out a mad cackle of laughter. Gaunt screamed, \"Mend it, you pointless lump, mend it!\" Merope stumbled across the room, but before she had time to raise her wand, Ogden had lifted his own and said firmly, \"Reparo. \" The pot mended itself instantly. Gaunt looked for a moment as though he was going to shout at Ogden, but seemed to think better of it: Instead, he jeered at his daughter, \"Lucky the nice man from the Ministry's here, isn't it? Perhaps he'll take you off my hands, perhaps he doesn't mind dirty Squibs. . . .\" Without looking at anybody or thanking Ogden, Merope picked up the pot and returned it, hands trembling, to its shelf. She then stood quite still, her back against the wall between the filthy window and the stove, as though she wished for nothing more than to sink into the stone and vanish. \"Mr. Gaunt,\" Ogden began again, \"as I've said: the reason for my visit --\" \"I heard you the first time!\" snapped Gaunt. \"And so what? Morfin gave a Muggle a bit of what was coming to him -- what about it, then?\" \"Morfin has broken Wizarding law,\" said Ogden sternly. \"'Morfin has broken Wizarding law.'\" Gaunt imitated Ogden’s voice, making it pompous and singsong. Morfin cackled again. \"He taught a filthy Muggle a lesson, that's illegal now, is it?\" \"Yes,\" said Ogden. \"I'm afraid it is.\" He pulled from an inside pocket a small scroll of parchment and unrolled it. \"What's that, then, his sentence?\" said Gaunt, his voice rising angrily. \"It is a summons to the Ministry for a hearing --\" \"Summons! Summons? Who do you think you are, summoning my son anywhere?\" \"I'm Head of the Magical Law Enforcement Squad,\" said Ogden. \"And you think we're scum, do you?\" screamed Gaunt, advancing on Ogden now, with a dirty yellow-nailed finger pointing at his chest. \"Scum who'll come running when the Ministry tells 'em to? Do you know who you're talking to, you filthy little Mudblood, do you?\" \"I was under the impression that I was speaking to Mr. Gaunt,\" said Ogden, looking wary, but standing his ground. \"That's right!\" roared Gaunt. For a moment, Harry thought Gaunt was making an obscene hand gesture, but then realized that he was showing Ogden the ugly, black-stoned ring he was wearing on his middle finger, waving it before Ogden's eyes. \"See this? See this? Know what it is? Know where it came from? Centuries it's been in our family, that's how far back we go, and pure-blood all the way! Know how much I've been offered for this, with the Peverell coat of arms engraved on the stone?\" \"I've really no idea,\" said Ogden, blinking as the ring sailed within an inch of his nose, \"and it's quite beside the point, Mr. Gaunt. Your son has committed --\" With a howl of rage, Gaunt ran toward his daughter. For a split second, Harry thought he was going to throttle her as his hand flew to her throat; next moment, he was dragging her toward Ogden by a gold chain around her neck. \"See this?\" he bellowed at Ogden, shaking a heavy gold locket at him, while Merope spluttered and gasped for breath. \"I see it, I see it!\" said Ogden hastily. \"Slytherins!\" yelled Gaunt. \"Salazar Slytherin's! We're his last living descendants, what do you say to that, eh?\" \"Mr. Gaunt, your daughter!\" said Ogden in alarm, but Gaunt had already released Merope; she staggered away from him, back to her corner, massaging her neck and gulping for air. \"So!\" said Gaunt triumphantly, as though he had just proved a complicated point beyond all possible dispute. \"Don't you go talking to us as if we're dirt on your shoes! Generations of purebloods, wizards all -- more than you can say, I don't doubt!\" And he spat on the floor at Ogdens feet. Morfin cackled again. Merope, huddled beside the window, her head bowed and her face hidden by her lank hair, said nothing. \"Mr. Gaunt,\" said Ogden doggedly, \"I am afraid that neither your ancestors nor mine have anything to do with the matter in hand. I am here because of Morfin, Morfin and the Muggle he accosted late last night. Our information\" -- he glanced down at his scroll of parchment -- \"is that Morfin performed a jinx or hex on the said Muggle, causing him to erupt in highly painful hives.\" Morfin giggled. \"Be quiet, boy,\" snarled Gaunt in Parseltongue, and Morfin fell silent again. \"And so what if he did, then?\" Gaunt said defiantly to Ogden, \"I expect you've wiped the Muggle's filthy face clean for him, and his memory to boot--\" \"That's hardly the point, is it, Mr. Gaunt?\" said Ogden. \"This was an unprovoked attack on a defenseless --\" \"Ar, I had you marked out as a Muggle-lover the moment I saw you,\" sneered Gaunt, and he spat on the floor again. \"This discussion is getting us nowhere,\" said Ogden firmly. \"It is clear from your son's attitude that he feels no remorse for his actions.\" He glanced down at his scroll of parchment again. \"Morfin will attend a hearing on the fourteenth of September to answer the charges of using magic in front of a Muggle and causing harm and distress to that same Mugg --\" Ogden broke off. The jingling, clopping sounds of horses and loud, laughing voices were drifting in through the open window. Apparently the winding lane to the village passed very close to the copse where the house stood. Gaunt froze, listening, his eyes wide. Morfin hissed and turned his face toward the sounds, his expression hungry. Merope raised her head. Her face, Harry saw, was starkly white. \"My God, what an eyesore!\" rang out a girl's voice, as clearly audible through the open window as if she had stood in the room beside them. \"Couldn't your father have that hovel cleared away, Tom?\" \"It's not ours,\" said a young man's voice. \"Everything on the other side of the valley belongs to us, but that cottage belongs to an old tramp called Gaunt, and his children. The son's quite mad, you should hear some of the stories they tell in the village --\" The girl laughed. The jingling, clopping noises were growing louder and louder. Morfin made to get out of his armchair. \"Keep your seat,\" said his father warningly, in Parseltongue. \"Tom,\" said the girl's voice again, now so close they were clearly right beside the house, \"I might be wrong -- but has somebody nailed a snake to that door?\" \"Good lord, you're right!\" said the man's voice. \"That'll be the son, I told you he's not right in the head. Don't look at it, Cecilia, darling.\" The jingling and clopping sounds were now growing faint again. \"'Darling,'\" whispered Morfin in Parseltongue, looking at his sister. \"'Darling, he called her. So he wouldn't have you anyway.\" Merope was so white Harry felt sure she was going to faint. \"What's that?\" said Gaunt sharply, also in Parseltongue, looking from his son to his daughter. \"What did you say, Morfin?\" \"She likes looking at that Muggle,\" said Morfin, a vicious expression on his face as he stared at his sister, who now looked terrified. \"Always in the garden when he passes, peering through the hedge at him, isn't she? And last night -- \" Merope shook her head jerkily, imploringly, but Morfin went on ruthlessly, \"Hanging out of the window waiting for him to ride home, wasn't she?\" \"Hanging out of the window to look at a Muggle?\" said Gaunt quietly. All three of the Gaunts seemed to have forgotten Ogden, who was looking both bewildered and irritated at this renewed outbreak of incomprehensible hissing and rasping. \"Is it true?\" said Gaunt in a deadly voice, advancing a step or two toward the terrified girl. \"My daughter--pure-blooded descendant of Salazar Slytherin -- hankering after a filthy, dirt-veined Muggle?\" Merope shook her head frantically, pressing herself into the wall, apparently unable to speak. \"But I got him, Father!\" cackled Morfin. \"I got him as he went by and he didn't look so pretty with hives all over him, did he, Merope?\" \"You disgusting little Squib, you filthy little blood traitor!\" roared Gaunt, losing control, and his hands closed around his daughter's throat. Both Harry and Ogden yelled \"No!\" at the same time; Ogden raised his wand and cried, \"Relaskio!\" Gaunt was thrown backward, away from his daughter; he tripped over a chair and fell flat on his back. With a roar of rage, Morfin leapt out of his chair and ran at Ogden, brandishing his bloody knife and firing hexes indiscriminately from his wand. Ogden ran for his life. Dumbledore indicated that they ought to follow and Harry obeyed, Merope's screams echoing in his ears. Ogden hurtled up the path and erupted onto the main lane, his arms over his head, where he collided with the glossy chestnut horse ridden by a very handsome, dark-haired young man. Both he and the pretty girl riding beside him on a gray horse roared with laughter at the sight of Ogden, who bounced off the horse's flank and set off again, his frock coat flying, covered from head to foot in dust, running pell-mell up the lane. \"I think that will do, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. He took Harry by the elbow and tugged. Next moment, they were both soaring weightlessly through darkness, until they landed squarely on their feet, back in Dumbledore's now twilit office. \"What happened to the girl in the cottage?\" said Harry at once, as Dumbledore lit extra lamps with a flick of his wand. \"Merope, or whatever her name was?\" \"Oh, she survived,\" said Dumbledore, reseating himself behind his desk and indicating that Harry should sit down too. \"Ogden Apparated back to the Ministry and returned with reinforcements within fifteen minutes. Morfin and his father attempted to fight, but both were overpowered, removed from the cottage, and subsequently convicted by the Wizengamot. Morfin, who already had a record of Muggle attacks, was sentenced to three years in Azkaban. Marvolo, who had injured several Ministry employees in addition to Ogden, received six months.\" \"Marvolo?\" Harry repeated wonderingly. \"That's right,\" said Dumbledore, smiling in approval. \"I am glad to see you're keeping up.\" \"That old man was -- ?\" \"Voldemort's grandfather, yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"Marvolo, his son, Morfin, and his daughter, Merope, were the last of the Gaunts, a very ancient Wizarding family noted for a vein of instability and violence that flourished through the generations due to their habit of marrying their own cousins. Lack of sense coupled with a great liking for grandeur meant that the family gold was squandered several generations before Marvolo was born. He, as you saw, was left in squalor and poverty, with a very nasty temper, a fantastic amount of arrogance and pride, and a couple of family heirlooms that he treasured just as much as his son, and rather more than his daughter.\" \"So Merope,\" said Harry, leaning forward in his chair and star-ing at Dumbledore, \"so Merope was . . . Sir, does that mean she was . . . Voldemort's mother?\" \"It does,\" said Dumbledore. \"And it so happens that we also had a glimpse of Voldemort's father. I wonder whether you noticed?\" \"The Muggle Morfin attacked? The man on the horse?\" \"Very good indeed,\" said Dumbledore, beaming. \"Yes, that was Tom Riddle senior, the handsome Muggle who used to go riding past the Gaunt cottage and for whom Merope Gaunt cherished a secret, burning passion.\" \"And they ended up married?\" Harry said in disbelief, unable to imagine two people less likely to fall in love. \"I think you are forgetting,\" said Dumbledore, \"that Merope was a witch. I do not believe that her magical powers appeared to their best advantage when she was being terrorized by her father. Once Marvolo and Morfin were safely in Azkaban, once she was alone and free for the first time in her life, then, I am sure, she was able to give full rein to her abilities and to plot her escape from the desperate life she had led for eighteen years.\" \"Can you not think of any measure Merope could have taken to make Tom Riddle forget his Muggle companion, and fall in love with her instead?\" \"The Imperius Curse?\" Harry suggested. \"Or a love potion?\" \"Very good. Personally, I am inclined to think that she used a love potion. I am sure it would have seemed more romantic to her, and I do not think it would have been very difficult, some hot day, when Riddle was riding alone, to persuade him to take a drink of water. In any case, within a few months of the scene we have just witnessed, the village of Little Hangleton enjoyed a tremendous scandal. You can imagine the gossip it caused when the squire's son ran off with the tramp's daughter, Merope.\" \"But the villagers' shock was nothing to Marvolo's. He returned from Azkaban, expecting to find his daughter dutifully awaiting his return with a hot meal ready on his table. Instead, he found a clear inch of dust and her note of farewell, explaining what she had done.\" \"From all that I have been able to discover, he never mentioned her name or existence from that time forth. The shock of her desertion may have contributed to his early death -- or perhaps he had simply never learned to feed himself. Azkaban had greatly weakened Marvolo, and he did not live to see Morfin return to the cottage.\" \"And Merope? She ... she died, didn't she? Wasn't Voldemort brought up in an orphanage?\" \"Yes, indeed,\" said Dumbledore. \"We must do a certain amount of guessing here, although I do not think it is difficult to deduce what happened. You see, within a few months of their runaway marriage, Tom Riddle reappeared at the manor house in Little Hangleton without his wife. The rumor flew around the neighborhood that he was talking of being 'hoodwinked' and 'taken in.' What he meant, I am sure, is that he had been under an enchantment that had now lifted, though I daresay he did not dare use those precise words for fear of being thought insane. When they heard what he was saying, however, the villagers guessed that Merope had lied to Tom Riddle, pretending that she was going to have his baby, and that he had married her for this reason.\" \"But she did have his baby.\" \"But not until a year after they were married. Tom Riddle left her while she was still pregnant.\" \"What went wrong?\" asked Harry. \"Why did the love potion stop working?\" \"Again, this is guesswork,\" said Dumbledore, \"but I believe that Merope, who was deeply in love with her husband, could not bear to continue enslaving him by magical means. I believe that she made the choice to stop giving him the potion. Perhaps, besotted as she was, she had convinced herself that he would by now have fallen in love with her in return. Perhaps she thought he would stay for the baby's sake. If so, she was wrong on both counts. He left her, never saw her again, and never troubled to discover what became of his son.\" The sky outside was inky black and the lamps in Dumbledore's office seemed to glow more brightly than before. \"I think that will do for tonight, Harry,\" said Dumbledore after a moment or two. \"Yes, sir,\" said Harry. He got to his feet, but did not leave. \"Sir ... is it important to know all this about Voldemort's past?\" \"Very important, I think,\" said Dumbledore. \"And it... it's got something to do with the prophecy?\" \"It has everything to do with the prophecy.\" \"Right,\" said Harry, a little confused, but reassured all the same. He turned to go, then another question occurred to him, and he turned back again. \"Sir, am I allowed to tell Ron and Hermione everything you've told me?\" Dumbledore considered him for a moment, then said, \"Yes, I think Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger have proved themselves trust-worthy. But Harry, I am going to ask you to ask them not to repeat any of this to anybody else. It would not be a good idea if word got around how much I know, or suspect, about Lord Voldemort's secrets.\" \"No, sir, I'll make sure it's just Ron and Hermione. Good night.\" He turned away again, and was almost at the door when he saw it. Sitting on one of the little spindle-legged tables that supported so many frail-looking silver instruments, was an ugly gold ring set with a large, cracked, black stone. \"Sir,\" said Harry, staring at it. \"That ring--\" \"Yes?\" said Dumbledore. \"You were wearing it when we visited Professor Slughorn that night.\" \"So I was,\" Dumbledore agreed. \"But isn't it... sir, isn't it the same ring Marvolo Gaunt showed Ogden?\" Dumbledore bowed his head. \"The very same.\" \"But how come -- ? Have you always had it?\" \"No, I acquired it very recently,\" said Dumbledore. \"A few days before I came to fetch you from your aunt and uncle's, in fact.\" \"That would be around the time you injured your hand, then, sir?\" \"Around that time, yes, Harry.\" Harry hesitated.

            " TWENTYSEVEN  PADFOOT RETURNS One of the best things about the aftermath of the second task was that everybody was very keen to hear details of what had happened down in the lake, which meant that Ron was getting to share Harry's limelight for once. Harry noticed that Ron's version of events changed subtly with every retelling. At first, he gave what seemed to be the truth; it tallied with Hermione's story, anyway  Dumbledore had put all the hostages into a bewitched sleep in Professor McGonagall's office, first assuring them that they would be quite safe, and would awake when they were back above the water. One week later, however, Ron was telling a thrilling tale of kidnap in which he struggled singlehandedly against fifty heavily armed merpeople who had to beat him into submission before tying him up. \"But I had my wand hidden up my sleeve,\" he assured Padma Patil, who seemed to be a lot keener on Ron now that he was getting so much attention and was making a point of talking to him every time they passed in the corridors. \"I could've taken those meridiots any time I wanted.\" \"What were you going to do, snore at them?\" said Hermione waspishly. People had been teasing her so much about being the thing that Viktor Krum would most miss that she was in a rather tetchy mood. Ron's ears went red, and thereafter, he reverted to the bewitched sleep version of events. As they entered March the weather became drier, but cruel winds skinned their hands and faces every time they went out onto the grounds. There were delays in the post because the owls kept being blown off course. The brown owl that Harry had sent to Sirius with the dates of the Hogsmeade weekend turned up at breakfast on Friday morning with half its feathers sticking up the wrong way; Harry had no sooner torn off Sirius's reply than it took flight, clearly afraid it was going to be sent outside again. Sirius's letter was almost as short as the previous one. Be at stile at end of road out of Hogsmeade (past Dervish and Banges) at two o'clock on Saturday afternoon. Bring as much food as you can. \"He hasn't come back to Hogsmeade?\" said Ron incredulously. \"It looks like it, doesn't it?\" said Hermione. \"I can't believe him,\" said Harry tensely, \"if he's caught. . .\" \"Made it so far, though, hasn't he?\" said Ron. \"And it's not like the place is swarming with dementors anymore.\" Harry folded up the letter, thinking. If he was honest with himself, he really wanted to see Sirius again. He therefore approached the final lesson of the afternoon  double Potions  feeling considerably more cheerful than he usually did when descending the steps to the dungeons. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were standing in a huddle outside the classroom door with Pansy Parkinson's gang of Slytherin girls. All of them were looking at something Harry couldn't see and sniggering heartily. Pansys puglike face peered excitedly around Goyle's broad back as Harry, Ron, and Hermione approached. \"There they are, there they are!\" she giggled, and the knot of Slytherins broke apart. Harry saw that Pansy had a magazine in her hands  Witch Weekly. The moving picture on the front showed a curlyhaired witch who was smiling toothily and pointing at a large sponge cake with her wand. \"You might find something to interest you in there, Granger!\" Pansy said loudly, and she threw the magazine at Hermione, who caught it, looking startled. At that moment, the dungeon door opened, and Snape beckoned them all inside. Hermione, Harry, and Ron headed for a table at the back of the dungeon as usual. Once Snape had turned his back on them to write up the ingredients of todays potion on the blackboard, Hermione hastily rifled through the magazine under the desk. At last, in the center pages, Hermione found what they were looking for. Harry and Ron leaned in closer. A color photograph of Harry headed a short piece entitled: Harry Potter's Secret Heartache A boy like no other, perhaps  yet a boy suffering all the usual pangs of adolescence, writes Rita Skeeter. Deprived of love since the tragic demise of his parents, fourteenyearold Harry Potter thought he had found solace in his steady girlfriend at Hogwarts, Muggleborn Hermione Granger. Little did he know that he would shortly be suffering yet another emotional blow in a life already littered with personal loss. Miss Granger, a plain but ambitious girl, seems to have a taste for famous wizards that Harry alone cannot satisfy. Since the arrival at Hogwarts of Viktor Krum, Bulgarian Seeker and hero of the last World Quidditch Cup, Miss Granger has been toying with both boys' affections. Krum, who is openly smitten with the devious Miss Granger, has already invited her to visit him in Bulgaria over the summer holidays, and insists that he has \"never felt this way about any other girl.\" However, it might not be Miss Granger's doubtful natural charms that have captured these unfortunate boys' interest. \"She's really ugly,\" says Pansy Parkinson, a pretty and vivacious fourthyear student, \"but she'd be well up to making a Love Potion, she's quite brainy. I think that's how she's doing it.\" Love Potions are, of course, banned at Hogwarts, and no doubt Albus Dumbledore will want to investigate these claims. In the meantime, Harry Potters wellwishers must hope that, next time, he bestows his heart on a worthier candidate. \"I told you!\" Ron hissed at Hermione as she stared down at the article. \"I told you not to annoy Rita Skeeter! She's made you out to be some sort of of scarlet woman!\" Hermione stopped looking astonished and snorted with laughter. \"Scarlet woman?\" she repeated, shaking with suppressed giggles as she looked around at Ron. \"It's what my mum calls them,\" Ron muttered, his ears going red. \"If that's the best Rita can do, she's losing her touch,\" said Hermione, still giggling, as she threw Witch Weekly onto the empty chair beside her. \"What a pile of old rubbish.\" She looked over at the Slytherins, who were all watching her and Harry closely across the room to see if they had been upset by the article. Hermione gave them a sarcastic smile and a wave, and she, Harry, and Ron started unpacking the ingredients they would need for their WitSharpening Potion. \"There's something funny, though,\" said Hermione ten minutes later, holding her pestle suspended over a bowl of scarab beetles. \"How could Rita Skeeter have known . . . ?\" \"Known what?\" said Ron quickly. \"You haven't been mixing up Love Potions, have you?\" \"Don't be stupid,\" Hermione snapped, starting to pound up her beetles again. \"No, it's just. . . how did she know Viktor asked me to visit him over the summer?\" Hermione blushed scarlet as she said this and determinedly avoided Ron's eyes. \"What?\" said Ron, dropping his pestle with a loud clunk. \"He asked me right after he'd pulled me out of the lake,\" Hermione muttered. \"After he'd got rid of his shark's head. Madam Pomfrey gave us both blankets and then he sort of pulled me away from the judges so they wouldn't hear, and he said, if I wasn't doing anything over the summer, would I like to \" \"And what did you say?\" said Ron, who had picked up his pestle and was grinding it on the desk, a good six inches from his bowl, because he was looking at Hermione. \"And he did say he'd never felt the same way about anyone else,\" Hermione went on, going so red now that Harry could almost feel the heat coming from her, \"but how could Rita Skeeter have heard him? She wasn't there ... or was she? Maybe she has got an Invisibility Cloak; maybe she sneaked onto the grounds to watch the second task. ...\" \"And what did you say?\" Ron repeated, pounding his pestle down so hard that it dented the desk. \"Well, I was too busy seeing whether you and Harry were okay to\" \"Fascinating though your social life undoubtedly is. Miss Granger,\" said an icy voice right behind them, and all three of them jumped, \"I must ask you not to discuss it in my class. Ten points from Gryffindor.\" Snape had glided over to their desk while they were talking. The whole class was now looking around at them; Malfoy took the opportunity to flash POTTER STINKS across the dungeon at Harry. \"Ah . . . reading magazines under the table as well?\" Snape added, snatching up the copy of Witch Weekly. \"A further ten points from Gryffindor ... oh but of course ...\" Snapes black eyes glittered as they fell on Rita Skeeter's article. \"Potter has to keep up with his press cuttings. . . .\" The dungeon rang with the Slytherins' laughter, and an unpleasant smile curled Snape's thin mouth. To Harry's fury, he began to read the article aloud. \"'Harry Potter's Secret Heartache. . . dear, dear. Potter, what's ailing you now? 'A boy like no other, perhaps. . .'“ Harry could feel his face burning. Snape was pausing at the end of every sentence to allow the Slytherins a hearty laugh. The article sounded ten times worse when read by Snape. Even Hermione was blushing scarlet now. \"'. . . Harry Potter's wellwishers must hope that, next time, he bestows his heart upon a worthier candidate.' How very touching,\" sneered Snape, rolling up the magazine to continued gales of laughter from the Slytherins. \"Well, I think I had better separate the three of you, so you can keep your minds on your potions rather than on your tangled love lives. Weasley, you stay here. Miss Granger, over there, beside Miss Parkinson. Potter  that table in front of my desk. Move. Now.\" Furious, Harry threw his ingredients and his bag into his cauldron and dragged it up to the front of the dungeon to the empty table. Snape followed, sat down at his desk and watched Harry unload his cauldron. Determined not to look at Snape, Harry resumed the mashing of his scarab beetles, imagining each one to have Snape's face. \"All this press attention seems to have inflated your already overlarge head. Potter,\" said Snape quietly, once the rest of the class had settled down again. Harry didn't answer. He knew Snape was trying to provoke him; he had done this before. No doubt he was hoping for an excuse to take a round fifty points from Gryffindor before the end of the class. \"You might be laboring under the delusion that the entire wizarding world is impressed with you,\" Snape went on, so quietly that no one else could hear him (Harry continued to pound his scarab beetles, even though he had already reduced them to a very fine powder), \"but I don't care how many times your picture appears in the papers. To me. Potter, you are nothing but a nasty little boy who considers rules to be beneath him.\" Harry tipped the powdered beetles into his cauldron and started cutting up his ginger roots. His hands were shaking slightly out of anger, but he kept his eyes down, as though he couldn't hear what Snape was saying to him. \"So I give you fair warning, Potter,\" Snape continued in a sorter and more dangerous voice, \"pintsized celebrity or not  if I catch you breaking into my office one more time \" \"I haven't been anywhere near your office!\" said Harry angrily, forgetting his feigned deafness. \"Don't lie to me,\" Snape hissed, his fathomless black eyes boring into Harrys. \"Boomslang skin. Gillyweed. Both come from my private stores, and I know who stole them.\" Harry stared back at Snape, determined not to blink or to look guilty. In truth, he hadn't stolen either of these things from Snape. Hermione had taken the boomslang skin back in their second year  they had needed it for the Polyjuice Potion  and while Snape had suspected Harry at the time, he had never been able to prove it. Dobby, of course, had stolen the gillyweed. \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" Harry lied coldly. \"You were out of bed on the night my office was broken into!\" Snape hissed. \"I know it. Potter! Now, MadEye Moody might have joined your fan club, but I will not tolerate your behavior! One more nighttime stroll into my office, Potter, and you will pay!\" \"Right,\" said Harry coolly, turning back to his ginger roots. \"I'll bear that in mind if I ever get the urge to go in there.\" Snape's eyes flashed. He plunged a hand into the inside of his black robes. For one wild moment. Harry thought Snape was about to pull out his wand and curse him  then he saw that Snape had drawn out a small crystal bottle of a completely clear potion. Harry stared at it. \"Do you know what this is. Potter?\" Snape said, his eyes glittering dangerously again. \"No,\" said Harry, with complete honesty this time. \"It is Veritaserum  a Truth Potion so powerful that three drops would have you spilling your innermost secrets for this entire class to hear,\" said Snape viciously. \"Now, the use of this potion is controlled by very strict Ministry guidelines. But unless you watch your step, you might just find that my hand slips\"  he shook the crystal bottle slightly  \"right over your evening pumpkin juice. And then. Potter . . . then we'll find out whether you've been in my office or not.\" Harry said nothing. He turned back to his ginger roots once more, picked up his knife, and started slicing them again. He didn't like the sound of that Truth Potion at all, nor would he put it past Snape to slip him some. He repressed a shudder at the thought of what might come spilling out of his mouth if Snape did it... quite apart from landing a whole lot of people in trouble  Hermione and Dobby for a start  there were all the other things he was concealing . . . like the fact that he was in contact with Sirius . . . and  his insides squirmed at the thought  how he felt about Cho. ... He tipped his ginger roots into the cauldron too, and wondered whether he ought to take a leaf out of Moody s book and start drinking only from a private hip flask. There was a knock on the dungeon door. \"Enter,\" said Snape in his usual voice. The class looked around as the door opened. Professor Karkaroff came in. Everyone watched him as he walked up toward Snape's desk. He was twisting his finger around his goatee and looking agitated. \"We need to talk,\" said Karkaroff abruptly when he had reached Snape. He seemed so determined that nobody should hear what he was saying that he was barely opening his lips; it was as though he were a rather poor ventriloquist. Harry kept his eyes on his ginger roots, listening hard. \"I'll talk to you after my lesson, Karkaroff,\" Snape muttered, but Karkaroff interrupted him. \"I want to talk now, while you can't slip off, Severus. You've been avoiding me.\" \"After the lesson,\" Snape snapped. Under the pretext of holding up a measuring cup to see if he'd poured out enough armadillo bile, Harry sneaked a sidelong glance at the pair of them. Karkaroff looked extremely worried, and Snape looked angry. Karkaroff hovered behind Snape's desk for the rest of the double period. He seemed intent on preventing Snape from slipping away at the end of class. Keen to hear what Karkaroff wanted to say, Harry deliberately knocked over his bottle of armadillo bile with two minutes to go to the bell, which gave him an excuse to duck down behind his cauldron and mop up while the rest of the class moved noisily toward the door. \"What's so urgent?\" he heard Snape hiss at Karkaroff. \"This,\" said Karkaroff, and Harry, peering around the edge of his cauldron, saw Karkaroff pull up the lefthand sleeve of his robe and show Snape something on his inner forearm. \"Well?\" said Karkaroff, still making every effort not to move his lips. \"Do you see? It's never been this clear, never since  \" \"Put it away!\" snarled Snape, his black eyes sweeping the classroom. \"But you must have noticed \" Karkaroff began in an agitated voice. \"We can talk later, Karkaroff!\" spat Snape. \"Potter! What are you doing?\" \"Clearing up my armadillo bile, Professor,\" said Harry innocently, straightening up and showing Snape the sodden rag he was holding. Karkaroff turned on his heel and strode out of the dungeon. He looked both worried and angry. Not wanting to remain alone with an exceptionally angry Snape, Harry threw his books and ingredients back into his bag and left at top speed to tell Ron and Hermione what he had just witnessed. They left the castle at noon the next day to find a weak silver sun shining down upon the grounds. The weather was milder than it had been all year, and by the time they arrived in Hogsmeade, all three of them had taken off their cloaks and thrown them over their shoulders. The food Sirius had told them to bring was in Harry's bag; they had sneaked a dozen chicken legs, a loaf of bread, and a flask of pumpkin juice from the lunch table. They went into Gladrags Wizardwear to buy a present for Dobby, where they had fun selecting the most lurid socks they could find, including a pair patterned with flashing gold and silver stars, and another that screamed loudly when they became too smelly. Then, at half past one, they made their way up the High Street, past Dervish and Banges, and out toward the edge of the village. Harry had never been in this direction before. The winding lane was leading them out into the wild countryside around Hogsmeade. The cottages were fewer here, and their gardens larger; they were walking toward the foot of the mountain in whose shadow Hogsmeade lay. Then they turned a corner and saw a stile at the end of the lane. Waiting for them, its front paws on the topmost bar, was a very large, shaggy black dog, which was carrying some newspapers in its mouth and looking very familiar. . . . \"Hello, Sirius,\" said Harry when they had reached him. The black dog sniffed Harry's bag eagerly, wagged its tail once, then turned and began to trot away from them across the scrubby patch of ground that rose to meet the rocky foot of the mountain. Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed over the stile and followed. Sirius led them to the very foot of the mountain, where the ground was covered with boulders and rocks. It was easy for him, with his four paws, but Harry, Ron, and Hermione were soon out of breath. They followed Sirius higher, up onto the mountain itself. For nearly half an hour they climbed a steep, winding, and stony path, following Sirius's wagging tail, sweating in the sun, the shoulder straps of Harry's bag cutting into his shoulders. Then, at last, Sirius slipped out of sight, and when they reached the place where he had vanished, they saw a narrow fissure in the rock. They squeezed into it and found themselves in a cool, dimly lit cave. Tethered at the end of it, one end of his rope around a large rock, was Buckbeak the hippogriff. Half gray horse, half giant eagle, Buckbeak's fierce orange eye flashed at the sight of them. All three of them bowed low to him, and after regarding them imperiously for a moment, Buckbeak bent his scaly front knees and allowed Hermione to rush forward and stroke his feathery neck. Harry, however, was looking at the black dog, which had just turned into his godfather. Sirius was wearing ragged gray robes; the same ones he had been wearing when he had left Azkaban. His black hair was longer than it had been when he had appeared in the fire, and it was untidy and matted once more. He looked very thin. \"Chicken!\" he said hoarsely after removing the old Daily Prophets from his mouth and throwing them down onto the cave floor. Harry pulled open his bag and handed over the bundle of chicken legs and bread. \"Thanks,\" said Sirius, opening it, grabbing a drumstick, sitting down on the cave floor, and tearing off a large chunk with his teeth. \"I've been living off rats mostly. Can't steal too much food from Hogsmeade; I'd draw attention to myself.\" He grinned up at Harry, but Harry returned the grin only reluctantly. \"What're you doing here, Sirius?\" he said. \"Fulfilling my duty as godfather,\" said Sirius, gnawing on the chicken bone in a very doglike way. \"Don't worry about it, I'm pretending to be a lovable stray.\" He was still grinning, but seeing the anxiety in Harrys face, said more seriously, \"I want to be on the spot. Your last letter . . . well, let's just say things are getting fishier. I've been stealing the paper every time someone throws one out, and by the looks of things, I'm not the only one who's getting worried.\" He nodded at the yellowing Daily Prophets on the cave floor, and Ron picked them up and unfolded them. Harry, however, continued to stare at Sirius. \"What if they catch you? What if you're seen?\" \"You three and Dumbledore are the only ones around here who know I'm an Animagus,\" said Sirius, shrugging, and continuing to devour the chicken leg. Ron nudged Harry and passed him the Daily Prophets. There were two: The first bore the headline Mystery Illness ofBartemius Crouch, the second, Ministry Witch Still MissingMinister of Magic Now Personally Involved. Harry scanned the story about Crouch. Phrases jumped out at him: hasn't been seen in public since November. . . house appears deserted. . . St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries decline comment. . . Ministry refuses to confirm rumors of critical illness. . . . \"They're making it sound like he's dying,\" said Harry slowly. \"But he can't be that ill if he managed to get up here. . . .\" \"My brothers Crouch's personal assistant,\" Ron informed Sirius. \"He says Crouch is suffering from overwork.\" \"Mind you, he did look ill, last time I saw him up close,\" said Harry slowly, still reading the story. \"The night my name came out of the goblet. ...\" \"Getting his comeuppance for sacking Winky, isn't he?\" said Hermione, an edge to her voice. She was stroking Buckbeak, who was crunching up Sirius's chicken bones. \"I bet he wishes he hadn't done it now  bet he feels the difference now she's not there to look after him.\" \"Hermione's obsessed with houseelfs,\" Ron muttered to Sirius, casting Hermione a dark look. Sirius, however, looked interested. \"Crouch sacked his houseelf?\" \"Yeah, at the Quidditch World Cup,\" said Harry, and he launched into the story of the Dark Mark's appearance, and Winky being found with Harrys wand clutched in her hand, and Mr. Crouch's fury. When Harry had finished, Sirius was on his feet again and had started pacing up and down the cave. \"Let me get this straight,\" he said after a while, brandishing a fresh chicken leg. \"You first saw the elfin the Top Box. She was saving Crouch a seat, right?\" \"Right,\" said Harry, Ron, and Hermione together. \"But Crouch didn't turn up for the match?\" \"No,\" said Harry. \"I think he said he'd been too busy.\" Sirius paced all around the cave in silence. Then he said, \"Harry, did you check your pockets for your wand after you'd left the Top Box?\" \"Erm . . .\" Harry thought hard. \"No,\" he said finally. \"I didn't need to use it before we got in the forest. And then I put my hand in my pocket, and all that was in there were my Omnioculars.\" He stared at Sirius. \"Are you saying whoever conjured the Mark stole my wand in the Top Box?\" \"It's possible,\" said Sirius. \"Winky didn't steal that wand!\" Hermione insisted. \"The elf wasn't the only one in that box,\" said Sirius, his brow furrowed as he continued to pace. \"Who else was sitting behind you?\" \"Loads of people,\" said Harry. \"Some Bulgarian ministers .. . Cornelius Fudge ... the Malfoys ...\" \"The Malfoys!\" said Ron suddenly, so loudly that his voice echoed all around the cave, and Buckbeak tossed his head nervously. \"I bet it was Lucius Malfoy!\" \"Anyone else?\" said Sirius. \"No one,\" said Harry. \"Yes, there was, there was Ludo Bagman,\" Hermione reminded him. \"Oh yeah . . .\" \"I don't know anything about Bagman except that he used to be Beater for the Wimbourne Wasps,\" said Sirius, still pacing. \"What's he like?\" \"He's okay,\" said Harry. \"He keeps offering to help me with the Triwizard Tournament.\" \"Does he, now?\" said Sirius, frowning more deeply. \"I wonder why he'd do that?\" \"Says he's taken a liking to me,\" said Harry. \"Hmm,\" said Sirius, looking thoughtful. \"We saw him in the forest just before the Dark Mark appeared,\" Hermione told Sirius. \"Remember?\" she said to Harry and Ron. \"Yeah, but he didn't stay in the forest, did he?\" said Ron. \"The moment we told him about the riot, he went off to the campsite.\" \"How d'you know?\" Hermione shot back. \"How d'you know where he Disapparated to?\" \"Come off it,\" said Ron incredulously. \"Are you saying you reckon Ludo Bagman conjured the Dark Mark?\" \"It's more likely he did it than Winky,\" said Hermione stubbornly. \"Told you,\" said Ron, looking meaningfully at Sirius, \"told you she's obsessed with house \" But Sirius held up a hand to silence Ron. \"When the Dark Mark had been conjured, and the elf had been discovered holding Harry's wand, what did Crouch do?\" \"Went to look in the bushes,\" said Harry, \"but there wasn't anyone else there.\" \"Of course,\" Sirius muttered, pacing up and down, \"of course, he'd want to pin it on anyone but his own elf... and then he sacked her?\" \"Yes,\" said Hermione in a heated voice, \"he sacked her, just because she hadn't stayed in her tent and let herself get trampled \" \"Hermione, will you give it a rest with the elf!\" said Ron. Sirius shook his head and said, \"She's got the measure of Crouch better than you have, Ron. If you want to know what a mans like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.\" He ran a hand over his unshaven face, evidently thinking hard. \"All these absences of Barty Crouch's ... he goes to the trouble of making sure his houseelf saves him a seat at the Quidditch World Cup, but doesn't bother to turn up and watch. He works very hard to reinstate the Triwizard Tournament, and then stops coming to that too. . . . It's not like Crouch. If he's ever taken a day off work because of illness before this, I'll eat Buckbeak.\" \"D'you know Crouch, then?\" said Harry. Sirius's face darkened. He suddenly looked as menacing as he had the night when Harry first met him, the night when Harry still believed Sirius to be a murderer. \"Oh I know Crouch all right,\" he said quietly. \"He was the one who gave the order for me to be sent to Azkaban  without a trial.\" \"What?\" said Ron and Hermione together. \"You're kidding!\" said Harry. \"No, I'm not,\" said Sirius, taking another great bite of chicken. \"Crouch used to be Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, didn't you know?\" Harry, Ron, and Hermione shook their heads. \"He was tipped for the next Minister of Magic,\" said Sirius. \"He's a great wizard, Barty Crouch, powerfully magical  and powerhungry. Oh never a Voldemort supporter,\" he said, reading the look on Harrys face. \"No, Barty Crouch was always very outspoken against the Dark Side. But then a lot of people who were against the Dark Side . . . well, you wouldn't understand . . . you're too young. ...\" \"That's what my dad said at the World Cup,\" said Ron, with a trace of irritation in his voice. \"Try us, why don't you?\" A grin flashed across Sirius's thin face. \"All right, I'll try you. . . .\" He walked once up the cave, back again, and then said, \"Imagine that Voldemort's powerful now. You don't know who his supporters are, you don't know who's working for him and who isn't; you know he can control people so that they do terrible things without being able to stop themselves. You're scared for yourself, and your family, and your friends. Every week, news comes of more deaths, more disappearances, more torturing . . . the Ministry of Magic's in disarray, they don't know what to do, they're trying to keep everything hidden from the Muggles, but meanwhile, Muggles are dying too. Terror everywhere . . . panic . . . confusion . . . that's how it used to be. \"Well, times like that bring out the best in some people and the worst in others. Crouch's principles might've been good in the beginning  I wouldn't know. He rose quickly through the Ministry, and he started ordering very harsh measures against Voldemorts supporters. The Aurors were given new powers  powers to kill rather than capture, for instance. And I wasn't the only one who was handed straight to the dementors without trial. Crouch fought violence with violence, and authorized the use of the Unforgivable Curses against suspects. I would say he became as ruthless and cruel as many on the Dark Side. He had his supporters, mind you  plenty of people thought he was going about things the right way, and there were a lot of witches and wizards clamoring for him to take over as Minister of Magic. When Voldemort disappeared, it looked like only a matter of time until Crouch got the top job. But then something rather unfortunate happened. ...\" Sirius smiled grimly. \"Crouch's own son was caught with a group of Death Eaters who'd managed to talk their way out of Azkaban. Apparently they were trying to find Voldemort and return him to power.\" \"Crouch's son was caught?\" gasped Hermione. \"Yep,\" said Sirius, throwing his chicken bone to Buckbeak, flinging himself back down on the ground beside the loaf of bread, and tearing it in half. \"Nasty little shock for old Barty, I'd imagine. Should have spent a bit more time at home with his family, shouldn't he? Ought to have left the office early once in a while . . . gotten to know his own son.\" He began to wolf down large pieces of bread. \"Was his son a Death Eater?\" said Harry. \"No idea,\" said Sirius, still stuffing down bread. \"I was in Azkaban myself when he was brought in. This is mostly stuff I've found out since I got out. The boy was definitely caught in the company of people I'd bet my life were Death Eaters  but he might have been in the wrong place at the wrong time, just like the houseelf.\" \"Did Crouch try and get his son off?\" Hermione whispered. Sirius let out a laugh that was much more like a bark. \"Crouch let his son off? I thought you had the measure of him, Hermione! Anything that threatened to tarnish his reputation had to go; he had dedicated his whole life to becoming Minister of Magic. You saw him dismiss a devoted house elf because she associated him with the Dark Mark again  doesn't that tell you what he's like? Crouch's fatherly affection stretched just far enough to give his son a trial, and by all accounts, it wasn't much more than an excuse for Crouch to show how much he hated the boy . . . then he sent him straight to Azkaban.\" \"He gave his own son to the dementors?\" asked Harry quietly. \"That's right,\" said Sirius, and he didn't look remotely amused now. \"I saw the dementors bringing him in, watched them through the bars in my cell door. He can't have been more than nineteen. They took him into a cell near mine. He was screaming for his mother by nightfall. He went quiet after a few days, though . . .they all went quiet in the end. . . except when they shrieked in their sleep. ...\" For a moment, the deadened look in Sirius's eyes became more pronounced than ever, as though shutters had closed behind them. \"So he's still in Azkaban?\" Harry said. \"No,\" said Sirius dully. \"No, he's not in there anymore. He died about a year after they brought him in.\" \"He died?\" \"He wasn't the only one,\" said Sirius bitterly. \"Most go mad in there, and plenty stop eating in the end. They lose the will to live. You could always tell when a death was coming, because the dementors could sense it, they got excited. That boy looked pretty sickly when he arrived. Crouch being an important Ministry member, he and his wife were allowed a deathbed visit. That was the last time I saw Barty Crouch, half carrying his wife past my cell. She died herself, apparently, shortly afterward. Grief. Wasted away just like the boy. Crouch never came for his sons body. The dementors buried him outside the fortress; I watched them do it.\" Sirius threw aside the bread he had just lifted to his mouth and instead picked up the flask of pumpkin juice and drained it. \"So old Crouch lost it all, just when he thought he had it made,\" he continued, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. \"One moment, a hero, poised to become Minister of Magic...next, his son dead, his wife dead, the family name dishonored, and, so I've heard since I escaped, a big drop in popularity. Once the boy had died, people started feeling a bit more sympathetic toward the son and started asking how a nice young lad from a good family had gone so badly astray. The conclusion was that his father never cared much for him. So Cornelius Fudge got the top job, and Crouch was shunted sideways into the Department of International Magical Cooperation.\" There was a long silence. Harry was thinking of the way Crouch's eyes had bulged as he'd looked down at his disobedient houseelf back in the wood at the Quidditch World Cup. This, then, must have been why Crouch had overreacted to Winky being found beneath the Dark Mark. It had brought back memories of his son, and the old scandal, and his fall from grace at the Ministry. \"Moody says Crouch is obsessed with catching Dark wizards,\" Harry told Sirius. \"Yeah, I've heard it's become a bit of a mania with him,\" said Sirius, nodding. \"If you ask me, he still thinks he can bring back the old popularity by catching one more Death Eater.\" \"And he sneaked up here to search Snape's office!\" s aid Ron triumphantly, looking at Hermione. \"Yes, and that doesn't make sense at all,\" said Sirius. \"Yeah, it does!\" said Ron excitedly, but Sirius shook his head. \"Listen, if Crouch wants to investigate Snape, why hasn't he been coming to judge the tournament? It would be an ideal excuse to make regular visits to Hogwarts and keep an eye on him.\" \"So you think Snape could be up to something, then?\" asked Harry, but Hermione broke in. \"Look, I don't care what you say, Dumbledore trusts Snape \" \"Oh give it a rest, Hermione,\" said Ron impatiently. \"I know Dumbledores brilliant and everything, but that doesn't mean a really clever Dark wizard couldn't fool him \" \"Why did Snape save Harry's life in the first year, then? Why didn't he just let him die?\" \"I dunno  maybe he thought Dumbledore would kick him out\" \"What d'you think, Sirius?\" Harry said loudly, and Ron and Hermione stopped bickering to listen. \"I think they've both got a point,\" said Sirius, looking thoughtfully at Ron and Hermione. \"Ever since I found out Snape was teaching here, I've wondered why Dumbledore hired him. Snape's always been fascinated by the Dark Arts, he was famous for it at school. Slimy, oily, greasyhaired kid, he was,\" Sirius added, and Harry and Ron grinned at each other. \"Snape knew more curses when he arrived at school than half the kids in seventh year, and he was part of a gang of Slytherins who nearly all turned out to be Death Eaters.\" Sirius held up his fingers and began ticking off names. \"Rosier and Wilkes  they were both killed by Aurors the year before Voldemort fell. The Lestranges  they're a married couple  they're in Azkaban. Avery  from what I've heard he wormed his way out of trouble by saying he'd been acting under the Imperius Curse  he's still at large. But as far as I know, Snape was never even accused of being a Death Eater  not that that means much. Plenty of them were never caught. And Snape s certainly clever and cunning enough to keep himself out of trouble.\" \"Snape knows Karkaroff pretty well, but he wants to keep that quiet,\" said Ron. \"Yeah, you should've seen Snape's face when Karkaroff turned up in Potions yesterday!\" said Harry quickly. \"Karkaroff wanted to talk to Snape, he says Snape's been avoiding him. Karkaroff looked really worried. He showed Snape something on his arm, but I couldn't see what it was.\" He showed Snape something on his arm?\" said Sirius, looking frankly bewildered. He ran his fingers distractedly through his filthy hair, then shrugged again. \"Well, I've no idea what that's about. . . but if Karkaroff s genuinely worried, and he's going to Snape for answers ...\" Sirius stared at the cave wall, then made a grimace of frustration. \"There's still the fact that Dumbledore trusts Snape, and I know Dumbledore trusts where a lot of other people wouldn't, but I just can't see him letting Snape teach at Hogwarts if he'd ever worked for Voldemort.\" \"Why are Moody and Crouch so keen to get into Snapes office then?\" said Ron stubbornly. \"Well,\" said Sirius slowly, \"I wouldn't put it past MadEye to have searched every single teacher's office when he got to Hogwarts. He takes his Defense Against the Dark Arts seriously, Moody. I'm not sure he trusts anyone at all, and after the things he's seen, it's not surprising. I'll say this for Moody, though, he never killed if he could help it. Always brought people in alive where possible. He was tough, but he never descended to the level of the Death Eaters. Crouch, though . . . he's a different matter ... is he really ill? If he is, why did he make the effort to drag himself up to Snape's office? And if he's not. . . what's he up to? What was he doing at the World Cup that was so important he didn't turn up in the Top Box! What's he been doing while he should have been judging the tournament?\" Sirius lapsed into silence, still staring at the cave wall. Buckbeak was ferreting around on the rocky floor, looking for bones he might have overlooked. Finally, Sirius looked up at Ron. \"You say your brother s Crouch's personal assistant? Any chance you could ask him if he's seen Crouch lately?\" \"I can try,\" said Ron doubtfully. \"Better not make it sound like I reckon Crouch is up to anything dodgy, though. Percy loves Crouch.\" \"And you might try and find out whether they've got any leads on Bertha Jorkins while you're at it,\" said Sirius, gesturing to the second copy of the Daily Prophet. \"Bagman told me they hadn't,\" said Harry. \"Yes, he's quoted in the article in there,\" said Sirius, nodding at the paper. \"Blustering on about how bad Bertha's memory is. Well, maybe she's changed since I knew her, but the Bertha I knew wasn't forgetful at all  quite the reverse. She was a bit dim, but she had an excellent memory for gossip. It used to get her into a lot of trouble; she never knew when to keep her mouth shut. I can see her being a bit of a liability at the Ministry of Magic . . . maybe that's why Bagman didn't bother to look for her for so long. ...\" Sirius heaved an enormous sigh and rubbed his shadowed eyes. \"What's the time?\" Harry checked his watch, then remembered it hadn't been working since it had spent over an hour in the lake. \"It's half past three,\" said Hermione. \"You'd better get back to school,\" Sirius said, getting to his feet. \"Now listen . . .\" He looked particularly hard at Harry. \"I don't want you lot sneaking out of school to see me, all right? Just send notes to me here. I still want to hear about anything odd. But you're not to go leaving Hogwarts without permission; it would be an ideal opportunity for someone to attack you.\" \"No one's tried to attack me so far, except a dragon and a couple of grindylows,\" Harry said, but Sirius scowled at him. \"I don't care . . . I'll breathe freely again when this tournament's over, and that's not until June. And don't forget, if you're talking about me among yourselves, call me Snuffles, okay?\" He handed Harry the empty napkin and flask and went to pat Buckbeak goodbye. \"I'll walk to the edge of the village with you,\" said Sirius, \"see if I can scrounge another paper.\" He transformed into the great black dog before they left the cave, and they walked back down the mountainside with him, across the boulderstrewn ground, and back to the stile. Here he allowed each of them to pat him on the head, before turning and setting off at a run around the outskirts of the village. Harry, Ron, and Hermione made their way back into Hogsmeade and up toward Hogwarts. \"Wonder if Percy knows all that stuff about Crouch?\" Ron said as they walked up the drive to the castle. \"But maybe he doesn't care . . . It'd probably just make him admire Crouch even more. Yeah, Percy loves rules. He'd just say Crouch was refusing to break them for his own son.\" \"Percy would never throw any of his family to the dementors,\" said Hermione severely. \"I don't know,\" said Ron. \"If he thought we were standing in the way of his career .. . Percy's really ambitious, you know. ...\" They walked up the stone steps into the entrance hall, where the delicious smells of dinner wafted toward them from the Great Hall. \"Poor old Snuffles,\" said Ron, breathing deeply. \"He must really like you. Harry. . . . Imagine having to live off rats.\" \n",

            " THIRTYTHREE  THE DEATH EATERS Voldemort looked away from Harry and began examining his own body. His hands were like large, pale spiders; his long white fingers caressed his own chest, his arms, his face; the red eyes, whose pupils were slits, like a cats, gleamed still more brightly through the darkness. He held up his hands and flexed the fingers, his expression rapt and exultant. He took not the slightest notice of Wormtail, who lay twitching and bleeding on the ground, nor of the great snake, which had slithered back into sight and was circling Harry again, hissing. Voldemort slipped one of those unnaturally longfingered hands into a deep pocket and drew out a wand. He caressed it gently too; and then he raised it, and pointed it at Wormtail, who was lifted off the ground and thrown against the headstone where Harry was tied; he fell to the foot of it and lay there, crumpled up and crying. Voldemort turned his scarlet eyes upon Harry, laughing a high, cold, mirthless laugh. Wormtail's robes were shining with blood now; he had wrapped the stump of his arm in them. \"My Lord . . .\" he choked, \"my Lord . . . you promised . . . you did promise ...\" \"Hold out your arm,\" said Voldemort lazily. \"Oh Master . . . thank you, Master ...\" He extended the bleeding stump, but Voldemort laughed again. \"The other arm, Wormtail.\" \"Master, please . . .please ...\" Voldemort bent down and pulled out Wormtail's left arm; he forced the sleeve of Wormtail's robes up past his elbow, and Harry saw something upon the skin there, something like a vivid red tattoo  a skull with a snake protruding from its mouth  the image that had appeared in the sky at the Quidditch World Cup: the Dark Mark. Voldemort examined it carefully, ignoring Wormtail's uncontrollable weeping. \"It is back,\" he said softly, \"they will all have noticed it... and now, we shall see ... now we shall know ...\" He pressed his long white forefinger to the brand on Wormtail's arm. The scar on Harry s forehead seared with a sharp pain again, and Wormtail let out a fresh howl; Voldemort removed his fingers from Wormtail's mark, and Harry saw that it had turned jet black. A look of cruel satisfaction on his face, Voldemort straightened up, threw back his head, and stared around at the dark graveyard. \"How many will be brave enough to return when they feel it?\" he whispered, his gleaming red eyes fixed upon the stars. \"And how many will be foolish enough to stay away?\" He began to pace up and down before Harry and Wormtail, eyes sweeping the graveyard all the while. After a minute or so, he looked down at Harry again, a cruel smile twisting his snakelike face. \"You stand, Harry Potter, upon the remains of my late father,\" he hissed softly. \"A Muggle and a fool. . . very like your dear mother. But they both had their uses, did they not? Your mother died to defend you as a child . . . and I killed my father, and see how useful he has proved himself, in death. ...\" Voldemort laughed again. Up and down he paced, looking all around him as he walked, and the snake continued to circle in the grass. \"You see that house upon the hillside, Potter? My father lived there. My mother, a witch who lived here in this village, fell in love with him. But he abandoned her when she told him what she was. ... He didn't like magic, my father . . . \"He left her and returned to his Muggle parents before I was even born. Potter, and she died giving birth to me, leaving me to be raised in a Muggle orphanage . . . but I vowed to find him ... I revenged myself upon him, that fool who gave me his name . . . Tom Riddle. . . .\" Still he paced, his red eyes darting from grave to grave. \"Listen to me, reliving family history . . .\" he said quietly, \"why, I am growing quite sentimental. . . . But look, Harry! My true family returns. . . .\" The air was suddenly full of the swishing of cloaks. Between graves, behind the yew tree, in every shadowy space, wizards were Apparating. All of them were hooded and masked. And one by one they moved forward . . . slowly, cautiously, as though they could hardly believe their eyes Voldemort stood in silence, waiting for them. Then one of the Death Eaters fell to his knees, crawled toward Voldemort and kissed the hem of his black robes. Master . . . Master \" he murmured. The Death Eaters behind him did the same; each of them approaching Voldemort on his knees and kissing his robes, before backing away and standing up, forming a silent circle, which enclosed Tom Riddle s grave, Harry, Voldemort, and the sobbing and twitching heap that was Wormtail. Yet they left gaps in the circle, as though waiting for more people. Voldemort, however, did not seem to expect more. He looked around at the hooded faces, and though there was no wind rustling seemed to run around the circle, as though it had shivered. \"Welcome, Death Eaters,\" said Voldemort quietly. \"Thirteen years. . . thirteen years since last we met. Yet you answer my call as though it were yesterday, we are still united under the Dark Mark, then! Or are we?\" He put back his terrible face and sniffed, his slitlike nostrils widening. \"I smell guilt,\" he said. \"There is a stench or guilt upon the air. A second shiver ran around the circle, as though each member of it longed, but did not dare to step back from him. \"I see you all, whole and healthy, with your powers intact  such prompt appearances! and I ask myself . . . why did this band of wizards never come to the aid of their master, to whom they swore eternal loyalty?\" No one spoke. No one moved except Wormtail, who was upon the ground, still sobbing over his bleeding arm. \"And I answer myself,\" whispered Voldemort, \"they must have believed me broken, they thought I was gone. They slipped back among my enemies, and they pleaded innocence, and ignorance, and bewitchment. . . . \"And then I ask myself, but how could they have believed I would not rise again! They, who knew the steps I took, long ago, to guard myself against mortal death! They, who had seen proofs of the immensity of my power in the times when I was mightier than any wizard living! \"And I answer myself, perhaps they believed a still greater power could exist, one that could vanquish even Lord Voldemort. . . perhaps they now pay allegiance to another . . . perhaps that champion of commoners, of Mudbloods and Muggles, Albus Dumbledore?\" At the mention of Dumbledore's name, the members of the circle stirred, and some muttered and shook their heads. Voldemort ignored them. \"It is a disappointment to me ... I confess myself disappointed. . . .\" One of the men suddenly flung himself forward, breaking the circle. Trembling from head to foot, he collapsed at Voldemort's feet. \"Master!\" he shrieked, \"Master, forgive me! Forgive us all!\" Voldemort began to laugh. He raised his wand. \"Crucio!\" The Death Eater on the ground writhed and shrieked; Harry was sure the sound must carry to the houses around. . . . Let the police come, he thought desperately . . . anyone . .. anything. . . Voldemort raised his wand. The tortured Death Eater lay flat upon the ground, gasping. \"Get up, Avery,\" said Voldemort softly. \"Stand up. You ask for forgiveness? I do not forgive. I do not forget. Thirteen long years ... I want thirteen years' repayment before I forgive you. Wormtail here has paid some of his debt already, have you not, Wormtail?\" He looked down at Wormtail, who continued to sob. \"You returned to me, not out of loyalty, but out of fear of your old friends. You deserve this pain, Wormtail. You know that, don't you?\" \"Yes, Master,\" moaned Wormtail, \"please. Master . . . please ...\" \"Yet you helped return me to my body,\" said Voldemort coolly, watching Wormtail sob on the ground. \"Worthless and traitorous as you are, you helped me ... and Lord Voldemort rewards his helpers... .\" Voldemort raised his wand again and whirled it through the air. A streak of what looked like molten silver hung shining in the wand's wake. Momentarily shapeless, it writhed and then formed itself into a gleaming replica of a human hand, bright as moonlight, which soared downward and fixed itself upon Wormtails bleeding wrist. Wormtail's sobbing stopped abruptly. His breathing harsh and ragged, he raised his head and stared in disbelief at the silver hand, now attached seamlessly to his arm, as though he were wearing a dazzling glove. He flexed the shining fingers, then, trembling, picked up a small twig on the ground and crushed it into powder. \"My Lord,\" he whispered. \"Master ... it is beautiful. . . thank you... thank you. ...\" He scrambled forward on his knees and kissed the hem of Voldemort's robes. \"May your loyalty never waver again, Wormtail,\" said Voldemort. \"No, my Lord . . . never, my Lord . . .\" Wormtail stood up and took his place in the circle, staring at his powerful new hand, his face still shining with tears. Voldemort now approached the man on Wormtail's right. \"Lucius, my slippery friend,\" he whispered, halting before him. \"I am told that you have not renounced the old ways, though to the world you present a respectable face. You are still ready to take the lead in a spot of Muggletorture, I believe? Yet you never tried to find me, Lucius. . . . Your exploits at the Quidditch World Cup were fun, I daresay. . . but might not your energies have been better directed toward finding and aiding your master?\" \"My Lord, I was constantly on the alert,\" came Lucius Malfoy's voice swiftly from beneath the hood. \"Had there been any sign from you, any whisper of your whereabouts, I would have been at your side immediately, nothing could have prevented me \" \"And yet you ran from my Mark, when a faithful Death Eater sent it into the sky last summer?\" said Voldemort lazily, and Mr. Malfoy stopped talking abruptly. \"Yes, I know all about that, Lucius. . . . You have disappointed me. ... I expect more faithful service in the future.\" \"Of course, my Lord, of course. . . . You are merciful, thank you. ...\" Voldemort moved on, and stopped, staring at the space  large enough for two people  that separated Malfoy and the next man. \"The Lestranges should stand here,\" said Voldemort quietly. \"But they are entombed in Azkaban. They were faithful. They went to Azkaban rather than renounce me. . . . When Azkaban is broken open, the Lestranges will be honored beyond their dreams. The dementors will join us ... they are our natural allies ... we will recall the banished giants ... I shall have all my devoted servants returned to me, and an army of creatures whom all fear. ...\" He walked on. Some of the Death Eaters he passed in silence, but he paused before others and spoke to them. \"Macnair . . . destroying dangerous beasts for the Ministry of Magic now, Wormtail tells me? You shall have better victims than that soon, Macnair. Lord Voldemort will provide. ...\" \"Thank you, Master . . . thank you,\" murmured Macnair. \"And here\"  Voldemort moved on to the two largest hooded figures  \"we have Crabbe . . . you will do better this time, will you not, Crabbe? And you, Goyle?\" They bowed clumsily, muttering dully. \"Yes, Master ...\" \"We will, Master....\" \"The same goes for you, Nott,\" said Voldemort quietly as he walked past a stooped figure in Mr. Goyles shadow. \"My Lord, I prostrate myself before you, I am your most faithful \" \"That will do,\" said Voldemort. He had reached the largest gap of all, and he stood surveying it with his blank, red eyes, as though he could see people standing there. \"And here we have six missing Death Eaters . . . three dead in my service. One, too cowardly to return ... he will pay. One, who I believe has left me forever ... he will be killed, of course . . . and one, who remains my most faithful servant, and who has already reentered my service.\" The Death Eaters stirred, and Harry saw their eyes dart sideways at one another through their masks. \"He is at Hogwarts, that faithful servant, and it was through his efforts that our young friend arrived here tonight. . . . \"Yes,\" said Voldemort, a grin curling his lipless mouth as the eyes of the circle flashed in Harry's direction. \"Harry Potter has kindly joined us for my rebirthing party. One might go so far as to call him my guest of honor.\" There was a silence. Then the Death Eater to the right of Wormtail stepped forward, and Lucius Malfoy's voice spoke from under the mask. \"Master, we crave to know ... we beg you to tell us ... how you have achieved this . . . this miracle . . . how you managed to return to us. .. .\" \"Ah, what a story it is, Lucius,\" said Voldemort. \"And it begins  and ends  with my young friend here.\" He walked lazily over to stand next to Harry, so that the eyes of the whole circle were upon the two of them. The snake continued to circle. \"You know, of course, that they have called this boy my downfall?\" Voldemort said softly, his red eyes upon Harry, whose scar began to burn so fiercely that he almost screamed in agony. \"You all know that on the night I lost my powers and my body, I tried to kill him. His mother died in the attempt to save him  and unwittingly provided him with a protection I admit I had not foreseen. ... I could not touch the boy.\" Voldemort raised one of his long white fingers and put it very close to Harry's cheek. \"His mother left upon him the traces other sacrifice. . . . This is old magic, I should have remembered it, I was foolish to overlook it... but no matter. I can touch him now.\" Harry felt the cold tip of the long white finger touch him, and thought his head would burst with the pain. Voldemort laughed softly in his ear, then took the finger away and continued addressing the Death Eaters. \"I miscalculated, my friends, I admit it. My curse was deflected by the woman's foolish sacrifice, and it rebounded upon myself. Aaah . . . pain beyond pain, my friends; nothing could have prepared me for it. I was ripped from my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost. . . but still, I was alive. What I was, even I do not know... I, who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality. You know my goal  to conquer death. And now, I was tested, and it appeared that one or more of my experiments had worked ... for I had not been killed, though the curse should have done it. Nevertheless, I was as powerless as the weakest creature alive, and without the means to help myself... for I had no body, and every spell that might have helped me required the use of a wand. . . . \"I remember only forcing myself, sleeplessly, endlessly, second by second, to exist. ... I settled in a faraway place, in a forest, and I waited. . . . Surely, one of my faithful Death Eaters would try and find me. . . one of them would come and perform the magic I could not, to restore me to a body . . , but I waited in vain. ...\" The shiver ran once more around the circle of listening Death Eaters. Voldemort let the silence spiral horribly before continuing. \"Only one power remained to me. I could possess the bodies of others. But I dared not go where other humans were plentiful, for I knew that the Aurors were still abroad and searching for me. I sometimes inhabited animals  snakes, of course, being my preference  but I was little better off inside them than as pure spirit, for their bodies were ill adapted to perform magic . . . and my possession of them shortened their lives; none of them lasted long. . . . \"Then . . . four years ago . . . the means for my return seemed assured. A wizard  young, foolish, and gullible  wandered across my path in the forest I had made my home. Oh, he seemed the very chance I had been dreaming of... for he was a teacher at Dumbledore's school... he was easy to bend to my will... he brought me back to this country, and after a while, I took possession of his body, to supervise him closely as he carried out my orders. But my plan failed. I did not manage to steal the Sorcerer's Stone. I was not to be assured immortal life. I was thwarted . . . thwarted, once again, by Harry Potter. ...\" Silence once more; nothing was stirring, not even the leaves on the yew tree. The Death Eaters were quite motionless, the glittering eyes in their masks fixed upon Voldemort, and upon Harry. \"The servant died when I left his body, and I was left as weak as ever I had been,\" Voldemort continued. \"I returned to my hiding place far away, and I will not pretend to you that I didn't then fear that I might never regain my powers. . . . Yes, that was perhaps my darkest hour... I could not hope that I would be sent another wizard to possess . . . and I had given up hope, now, that any of my Death Eaters cared what had become of me. ...\" One or two of the masked wizards in the circle moved uncomfortably, but Voldemort took no notice. \"And then, not even a year ago, when I had almost abandoned hope, it happened at last... a servant returned to me. Wormtail here, who had faked his own death to escape justice, was driven out of hiding by those he had once counted friends, and decided to return to his master. He sought me in the country where it had long been rumored I was hiding . . . helped, of course, by the rats he met along the way. Wormtail has a curious affinity with rats, do you not, Wormtail? His filthy little friends told him there was a place, deep in an Albanian forest, that they avoided, where small animals like themselves had met their deaths by a dark shadow that possessed them. . . . \"But his journey back to me was not smooth, was it, Wormtail? For, hungry one night, on the edge of the very forest where he had hoped to find me, he foolishly stopped at an inn for some food . . . and who should he meet there, but one Bertha Jorkins, a witch from the Ministry of Magic. \"Now see the way that fate favors Lord Voldemort. This might have been the end of Wormtail, and of my last hope for regeneration. But Wormtail  displaying a presence of mind I would never have expected from him  convinced Bertha Jorkins to accompany him on a nighttime stroll. He overpowered her ... he brought her to me. And Bertha Jorkins, who might have ruined all, proved instead to be a gift beyond my wildest dreams ... for  with a little persuasion  she became a veritable mine of information. \"She told me that the Triwizard Tournament would be played at Hogwarts this year. She told me that she knew of a faithful Death Eater who would be only too willing to help me, if I could only contact him. She told me many things. . . but the means I used to break the Memory Charm upon her were powerful, and when I had extracted all useful information from her, her mind and body were both damaged beyond repair. She had now served her purpose. I could not possess her. I disposed of her.\" Voldemort smiled his terrible smile, his red eyes blank and pitiless. \"Wormtail's body, of course, was ill adapted for possession, as all assumed him dead, and would attract far too much attention if noticed. However, he was the ablebodied servant I needed, and, poor wizard though he is, Wormtail was able to follow the instructions I gave him, which would return me to a rudimentary, weak body of my own, a body I would be able to inhabit while awaiting the essential ingredients for true rebirth ... a spell or two of my own invention ... a little help from my dear Nagini,\" Voldemorts red eyes fell upon the continually circling snake, \"a potion concocted from unicorn blood, and the snake venom Nagini provided ... I was soon returned to an almost human form, and strong enough to travel. \"There was no hope of stealing the Sorcerer's Stone anymore, for I knew that Dumbledore would have seen to it that it was destroyed. But I was willing to embrace mortal life again, before chasing immortality. I set my sights lower ... I would settle for my old body back again, and my old strength. \"I knew that to achieve this  it is an old piece of Dark Magic, the potion that revived me tonight  I would need three powerful ingredients. Well, one of them was already at hand, was it not, Wormtail? Flesh given by a servant. . . . \"My father's bone, naturally, meant that we would have to come here, where he was buried. But the blood of a foe ... Wormtail would have had me use any wizard, would you not, Wormtail? Any wizard who had hated me ... as so many of them still do. But I knew the one I must use, if I was to rise again, more powerful than I had been when I had fallen. I wanted Harry Potters blood. I wanted the blood of the one who had stripped me of power thirteen years ago . . . for the lingering protection his mother once gave him would then reside in my veins too. . \"But how to get at Harry Potter? For he has been better protected than I think even he knows, protected in ways devised by Dumbledore long ago, when it fell to him to arrange the boy's future. Dumbledore invoked an ancient magic, to ensure the boy's protection as long as he is in his relations' care. Not even I can touch him there. . . . Then, of course, there was the Quidditch World Cup. ... I thought his protection might be weaker there, away from his relations and Dumbledore, but I was not yet strong enough to attempt kidnap in the midst of a horde of Ministry wizards. And then, the boy would return to Hogwarts, where he is under the crooked nose of that Muggleloving fool from morning until night. So how could I take him! \"Why ... by using Bertha Jorkins's information, of course. Use my one faithful Death Eater, stationed at Hogwarts, to ensure that the boy's name was entered into the Goblet of Fire. Use my Death Eater to ensure that the boy won the tournament  that he touched the Triwizard Cup first  the cup which my Death Eater had turned into a Portkey, which would bring him here, beyond the reach of Dumbledore's help and protection, and into my waiting arms. And here he is ... the boy you all believed had been my downfall. ...\" Voldemort moved slowly forward and turned to face Harry. He raised his wand. \"Crucio!\" It was pain beyond anything Harry had ever experienced; his very bones were on fire; his head was surely splitting along his scar; his eyes were rolling madly in his head; he wanted it to end ... to black out... to die ... And then it was gone. He was hanging limply in the ropes binding him to the headstone of Voldemort's father, looking up into those bright red eyes through a kind of mist. The night was ringing with the sound of the Death Eaters' laughter. \"You see, I think, how foolish it was to suppose that this boy could ever have been stronger than me,\" said Voldemort. \"But I want there to be no mistake in anybody's mind. Harry Potter escaped me by a lucky chance. And I am now going to prove my power by killing him, here and now, in front of you all, when there is no Dumbledore to help him, and no mother to die for him. I will give him his chance. He will be allowed to fight, and you will be left in no doubt which of us is the stronger. Just a little longer, Nagini,\" he whispered, and the snake glided away through the grass to where the Death Eaters stood watching. \"Now untie him, Wormtail, and give him back his wand.\" \n",

            ": The Half-Blood Prince Harry and Ron met Hermione in the common room before breakfast next morning. Hoping for some support in his theory, Harry lost no time in telling Hermione what he had overheard Malfoy saying on the Hogwarts Express. \"But he was obviously showing off for Parkinson, wasn't he?\" interjected Ron quickly, before Hermione could say anything. \"Well,\" she said uncertainly, \"I don't know. It would be like Malfoy to make himself seem more important than he is ... but that's a big lie to tell...\" \"Exactly,\" said Harry, but he could nor press the point, because so many people were trying to listen in to his conversation, not to mention staring at him and whispering behind their hands. \"It's rude to point,\" Ron snapped at a particularly minuscule first-year boy as they joined the queue to climb out of the portrait hole. The boy, who had been muttering something about Harry behind his hand to his friend, promptly turned scarlet and toppled out of the hole in alarm. Ron sniggered. \"I love being a sixth year. And were going to be getting free time this year. Whole periods when we can just sit up here and relax.\" \"We're going to need that time for studying, Ron!\" said Hermione, as they set off down the corridor. \"Yeah, but not today,\" said Ron. \"Today's going to be a real loss, I reckon.\" \"Hold it!\" said Hermione, throwing out an arm and halting a passing fourth year, who was attempting to push past her with a lime-green disk clutched tightly in his hand. \"Fanged Frisbees banned, hand it over,\" she told him sternly. The scowling boy handed over the snarling Frisbee, ducked under her arm, and took off after his friends. Ron waited for him to vanish, then tugged the Frisbee from Hermione's grip. \"Excellent, I've always wanted one of these.\" Hermione's remonstration was drowned by a loud giggle; Lavender Brown had apparently found Ron's remark highly amusing. She continued to laugh as she passed them, glancing back at Ron over her shoulder. Ron looked rather pleased with himself. The ceiling of the Great Hall was serenely blue and streaked with frail, wispy clouds, just like the squares of sky visible through the high mullioned windows. While they tucked into porridge and eggs and bacon, Harry and Ron told Hermione about their embarassing conversation with Hagrid the previous evening. \"But he can't really think we'd continue Care of Magical Creatures!\" she said, looking distressed. \"I mean, when has any of us expressed . . . you know . . . any enthusiasm?\" \"That's it, though, innit?\" said Ron, swallowing an entire fried egg whole. \"We were the ones who made the most effort in classes because we like Hagrid. But he thinks we liked the stupid subject. D'ya reckon anyone's going to go on to N.E.W.T.?\" Neither Harry nor Hermione answered; there was no need. They knew perfectly well that nobody in their year would want to continue Care of Magical Creatures. They avoided Hagrid's eye and returned his cheery wave only half-heartedly when he left the staff table ten minutes later. After they had eaten, they remained in their places, awaiting Professor McGonagall's descent from the staff table. The distribution of class schedules was more complicated than usual this year, for Professor McGonagall needed first to confirm that everybody had achieved the necessary O.W.L. grades to continue with their chosen N.E.W.T.s. Hermione was immediately cleared to continue with Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Herbology, Arithmancy, Ancient Runes, and Potions, and shot off to a first period Ancient Runes class without further ado. Neville took a little longer to sort out; his round face was anxious as Professor McGonagall looked down his application and then consulted his O.W.L results. \"Herbology, fine,\" she said. \"Professor Sprout will be delighted to see you back with an 'Outstanding' O.W.L. And you qualify for Defense Against the Dark Arts with 'Exceeds Expectations.' But the problem is Transfiguration. I'm sorry, Longbottom, but an 'Acceptable' really isn't good enough to continue to N.E.W.T. level. Just don't think you'd be able to cope with the coursework.\" Neville hung his head. Professor McGonagall peered at him through her square spectacles. \"Why do you want to continue with Transfiguration, anyway? I've never had the impression that you particularly enjoyed it.\" Neville looked miserable and muttered something about \"my grandmother wants.\" \"Hmph,\" snorted Professot McGonagall. \"It's high time your grandmother learned to be proud of the grandson she's got, rather than the one she thinks she ought to have - particularly after what happened at the Ministry.\" Neville turned very pink and blinked confusedly; Professor McGonagall had never paid him a compliment before. \"I'm sorry, Longbottom, but I cannot let you into my N.E.W.T. class. I see that you have an 'Exceeds Expectations' in Charm however - why not try for a N.E.W.T. in Charms?\" \"My grandmother thinks Charms is a soft option,\" mumbled Neville. \"Take Charms,\" said Professor McGonagall, \"and I shall drop Augusta a line reminding her that just because she failed her Charms O.W.L., the subject is not necessarily worthless.\" Smiling slightly at the look of delighted incredulity on Neville's face, Professor McGonagall tapped a blank schedule with the tip of her wand and handed it, now carrying details of his new classes, to Neville. Professor McGonagall turned next to Parvati Patil, whose first question was whether Firenze, the handsome centaur, was still teaching Divination. \"He and Professor Trelawney are dividing classes between them this year,\" said Professor McGonagall, a hint of disapproval in her voice; it was common knowledge that she despised the subject of Divination. \"The sixth year is being taken by Professor Trelawney.\" Parvati set off for Divination five minutes later looking slightly crestfallen. \"So, Potter, Potter . . .\" said Professor McGonagall, consulting her notes as she turned to Harry. \"Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Herbology, Transfiguration ... all fine. I must say, I was pleased with your Transfiguration mark, Potter, very pleased. Now, why haven't you applied to continue with Potions? I thought it was your ambition to become an Auror?\" \"It was, but you told me I had to get an 'Outstanding' in my O.W.L., Professor.\" \"And so you did when Professor Snape was teaching the subject. Professor Slughorn, however, is perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T. students with 'Exceeds Expectations' at O.W.L. Do you wish to proceed with Potions?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry, \"but I didn't buy the books or any ingredients or anything-\" \"I'm sure Professor Slughorn will be able to lend you some,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Very well, Potter, here is your schedule. Oh, by the way- twenty hopefuls have already put down their names for the Gryffindor Quidditch team. I shall pass the list to you in due course and you can fix up trials at your leisure.\" A few minutes later, Ron was cleared to do the same subjects as Harry, and the two of them left the table together. \"Look,\" said Ron delightedly, gazing ar his schedule, \"we've got a free period now. . . and a free period after break . . . and after lunch . . . excellent.\" They returned to the common room, which was empty apart from a half dozen seventh years, including Katie Bell, the only remaining member of the original Gryffindor Quidditch team that Harry had joined in his first year. \"I thought you'd get that, well done,\" she called over, pointing at the Captains badge on Harry's chest. \"Tell me when you call trials!\" \"Don't be stupid,\" said Harry, \"you don't need to try out, I watched you play for five years. . . .\" \"You mustn't start off like that,\" she said warningly. \"For all you know, there's someone much better than me out there. Good teams have been ruined before now because Captains just kept playing the old faces, or letting in their friends....\" Ron looked a little uncomfortable and began playing with the Fanged Frisbee Hermione had taken from the fourth-year student. It zoomed around the common room, snarling and attempting to take bites of the tapestry. Crookshanks's yellow eyes followed it and he hissed when it came too close. An hour later they reluctantly left the sunlit common room for the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom four floors below. Hermione was already queuing outside, carrying an armful of heavy books and looking put-upon. \"We got so much homework for Runes,\" she said anxiously when Harry and Ron joined her. \"A fifteen-inch essay, two translations, and I've got to read these by Wednesday!\" \"Shame,\" yawned Ron. \"You wait,\" she said resentfully. \"I bet Snape gives us loads.\" The classroom door opened as she spoke, and Snape stepped into the corridor, his sallow face framed as ever by two curtains of greasy black hair. Silence fell over the queue immediately. \"Inside,\" he said. Harry looked around as they entered. Snape had imposed his personality upon the room already; it was gloomier than usual, as curtains had been drawn over the windows, and was lit by candlelight. New pictures adorned the walls, many of them showing people who appeared to be in pain, sporting grisly injuries or strangely contorted body parts. Nobody spoke as they settled down, looking around at the shadowy, gruesome pictures. \"I have not asked you to take out your books,\" said Snape, closing the door and moving to face the class from behind his desk; Hermione hastily dropped her copy of Confronting the Faceless back into her bag and stowed it under her chair. \"I wish to speak to you, and I want your fullest attention.\" His black eyes roved over their upturned faces, lingering for a fraction of a second longer on Harry's than anyone else's. \"You have had five teachers in this subject so far, I believe.\" You believe . . . like you haven't watched them all come and go, hoping you'd be next, thought Harry scathingly. \"Naturally, these teachers will all have had their own methods and priorities. Given this confusion I am surprised so many of you scraped an O.W.L. in this subject. I shall be even more surprised if all of you manage to keep up with the N.E.W.T. work, which will be more advanced.\" Snape set off around the edge of the room, speaking now in a lower voice; the class craned their necks to keep him in view. \"The Dark Arts,\" said Snape, \"are many, varied, ever-changing, and eternal. Fighting them is like fighting a many-headed monster, which, each time a neck is severed, sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than before. You are fighting that which is unfixed, mutating, indestructible.\" Harry stared at Snape. It was surely one thing to respect the Dark Arts as a dangerous enemy, another to speak of them, as Snape was doing, with a loving caress in his voice? \"Your defenses,\" said Snape, a little louder, \"must therefore be as flexible and inventive as the arts you seek to undo. These pictures\" - he indicated a few of them as he swept past - \"give a fair representation of what happens to those who suffer, for instance, the Cruciatus Curse\" - he waved a hand toward a witch who was clearly shrieking in agony - \"feel the Dementor's Kiss\" - a wizard lying huddled and blank-eyed, slumped against a wall - \"or provoke the aggression of the Inferius\" - a bloody mass upon ground. \"Has an Inferius been seen, then?\" said Parvati Patil in a high pitched voice. \"Is it definite, is he using them?\" \"The Dark Lord has used Inferi in the past,\" said Snape, \"which means you would be well-advised to assume he might use them again. Now. . . \" He set off again around the other side of the classroom toward his desk, and again, they watched him as he walked, his dark robes billowing behind him. , \". . . you are, I believe, complete novices in the use of nonverbal spells. What is the advantage of a nonverbal spell?\" Hermione's hand shot into the air. Snape took his time looking around at everybody else, making sure he had no choice, before saying curtly, \"Very well - Miss Granger?\" \"Your adversary has no warning about what kind of magic you're about to perform,\" said Hermione, \"which gives you a split-second advantage.\" \"An answer copied almost word for word from The Standard Book of Spells, Grade Six,\" said Snape dismissively (over in the corner, Malfoy sniggered), \"but correct in essentials. Yes, those who progress in using magic without shouting incantations gain an element of surprise in their spell-casting. Not all wizards can do this, of course; it is a question of concentration and mind power which some\" - his gaze lingered maliciously upon Harry once more - \"lack.\" Harry knew Snape was thinking of their disastrous Occlumency lessons of the previous year. He refused to drop his gaze, but glowered at Snape until Snape looked away. \"You will now divide,\" Snape went on, \"into pairs. One partner will attempt to jinx the other without speaking. The other will attempt to repel the jinx in equal silence. Carry on.\" Although Snape did not know it, Harry had taught at least half the class (everyone who had been a member of the D.A.) how to perform a Shield Charm the previous year. None of them had ever cast the charm without speaking, however. A reasonable amount of cheating ensued; many people were merely whispering the incantation instead of saying it aloud. Typically, ten minutes into the lesson Hermione managed to repel Neville's muttered Jelly-Legs Jinx without uttering a single word, a feat that would surely have earned her twenty points for Gryffindor from any reasonable teacher, thought Harry bitterly, but which Snape ignored. He swept between them as they practiced, looking just as much like an overgrown bat as ever, lingering to watch Harry and Ron struggling with the task. Ron, who was supposed to be jinxing Harry, was purple in the face, his lips tightly compressed to save himself from the temptation of muttering the incantation. Harry had his wand raised, waiting on tenterhooks to repel a jinx that seemed unlikely ever to come. \"Pathetic, Weasley,\" said Snape, after a while. \"Here -- let me show you-\" He turned his wand on Harry so fast that Harry reacted instinctively; all thought of nonverbal spells forgotten, he yelled, \"Protego!\" His Shield Charm was so strong Snape was knocked off-balance and hit a desk. The whole class had looked around and now watched as Snape righted himself, scowling. \"Do you remember me telling you we are practicing nonverbal spells, Potter?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry stiffly. \"Yes, sir.\" \"There's no need to call me 'sir,' Professor.\" The words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying. Several people gasped, including Hermione. Behind Snape, however, Ron, Dean, and Seamus grinned appreciatively. \"Detention, Saturday night, my office,\" said Snape. \"I do not take cheek from anyone, Potter . . . not even 'the Chosen One.'\" \"That was brilliant, Harry!\" chortled Ron, once they were safely on their way to break a short while later. \"You really shouldn't have said it,\" said Hermione, frowning at Ron. \"What made you?\" \"He tried to jinx me, in case you didn't notice!\" fumed Harry. I had enough of that during those Occlumency lessons! Why doesn't he use another guinea pig for a change? What's Dumbledore playing at, anyway, letting him teach Defense? Did you hear him talking about the Dark Arts? He loves them! All that unfixed, indestructble stuff –\" \"Well,\" said Hermione, \"I thought he sounded a bit like you.\" \"Like me?\" \"Yes, when you were telling us what it's like to face Voldemort. You said it wasn't just memorizing a bunch of spells, you said it was just you and your brains and your guts - well, wasn't that what Snape was saying? That it really comes down to being brave and quick-thinking?\" Harry was so disarmed that she had thought his words as well worth memorizing as The Standard Book of Spells that he did not argue. \"Harry! Hey, Harry!\" Harry looked around; Jack Sloper, one of the Beaters on last year's Gryffindor Quidditch team, was hurrying toward him holding a roll of parchment. \"For you,\" panted Sloper. \"Listen, I heard you're the new Captain. When're you holding trials?\" \"I'm not sure yet,\" said Harry, thinking privately that Sloper would be very lucky to get back on the team. \"I'll let you know.\" \"Oh, right. I was hoping it'd be this weekend -\" \"But Harry was not listening; he had just recognized the thin, slanting writing on the parchment. Leaving Sloper in mid-sentence, he hurried away with Ron and Hermione, unrolling the parchment as he went. Dear Harry, I would like to start our private lessons this Saturday. Kindly come along to my office at 8 P.M. I hope you are enjoying your first day back at school. Yours sincerely, Albus Dumbledore P.S. I enjoy Acid Pops. \"He enjoys Acid Pops?\" said Ron, who had read the message over Harry's shoulder and was looking perplexed. \"It's the password to get past the gargoyle outside his study,\" said Harry in a low voice. \"Ha! Snape's not going to be pleased. . . . I won't be able to do his detention!\" He, Ron, and Hermione spent the whole of break speculating on what Dumbledore would teach Harry. Ron thought it most likely to be spectacular jinxes and hexes of the type the Death Eaters would not know. Hermione said such things were illegal, and thought it much more likely that Dumbledore wanted to teach Harry advanced Defensive magic. After break, she went off to Arithmancy while Harry and Ron returned to the common room where they grudgingly started Snape's homework. This turned out to be so complex that they still had not finished when Hermione joined them for their after-lunch free period (though she considerably speeded up the process). They had only just finished when the bell rang for the afternoon's double Potions and they beat the familiar path down to the dungeon classroom that had, for so long, been Snape's. When they arrived in the corridor they saw that there were only a dozen people progressing to N.E.W.T. level. Crabbe and Goyle had evidently failed to achieve the required O.W.L. grade, but four Slytherins had made it through, including Malfoy. Four Ravenclaws were there, and one Hufflepuff, Ernie Macmillan, whom Harry liked despite his rather pompous manner. \"Harry,\" Ernie said portentously, holding out his hand as Harry approached, \"didn't get a chance to speak in Defense Against The Dark Arts this morning. Good lesson, I thought, but Shield Charms are old hat, of course, for us old D.A. lags . . . And how are you, Ron -- Hermione?\" Before they could say more than \"fine,\" the dungeon door opened and Slughorn's belly preceded him out of the door. As they filed into the room, his great walrus mustache curved above his beaming mouth, and he greeted Harry and Zabini with particular enthusiasm. The dungeon was, most unusually, already full of vapors and odd smells. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sniffed interestedly as they passed large, bubbling cauldrons. The four Slytherins took a table together, as did the four Ravenclaws. This left Harry, Ron, and Hermione to share a table with Ernie. They chose the one nearest a gold-colored cauldron that was emitting one of the most seductive scents Harry had ever inhaled: Somehow it reminded him simultaneously of treacle tart, the woody smell of a broomstick handle, and something flowery he thought he might have smelled at the Burrow. He found that he was breathing very slowly and deeply and that the potion's fumes seemed to be filling him up like drink. A great contentment stole over him; he grinned across at Ron, who grinned back lazily. \"Now then, now then, now then,\" said Slughorn, whose massive outline was quivering through the many shimmering vapors. \"Scales out, everyone, and potion kits, and don't forget your copies of Advanced Potion-Making. . . .\" \"Sir?\" said Harry, raising his hand. \"Harry, m'boy?\" \"I haven't got a book or scales or anything - nor's Ron - we didn't realize we'd be able to do the N.E.W.T., you see -\" \"Ah, yes, Professor McGonagall did mention . . . not to worry, my dear boy, not to worry at all. You can use ingredients from the store cupboard today, and I'm sure we can lend you some scales, and we've got a small stock of old books here, they'll do until you can write to Flourish and Blotts. . . .\" Slughorn strode over to a corner cupboard and, after a moment's foraging, emerged with two very battered-looking copies of Advanced Potion-Making by Libatius Borage, which he gave to Harry and Ron along with two sets of tarnished scales. \"Now then,\" said Slughorn, returning to the front of the class and inflating his already bulging chest so that the buttons on his waistcoat threatened to burst off, \"I've prepared a few potions for you to have a look at, just out of interest, you know. These are the kind of thing you ought to be able to make after completing your N.E.W.T.s. You ought to have heard of 'em, even if you haven't made 'em yet. Anyone tell me what this one is?\" He indicated the cauldron nearest the Slytherin table. Harry raised himself slighty in his seat and saw what looked like plain water boiling away inside it. Hermione's well-practiced hand hit the air before anybody else's; Slughorn pointed at her. \"It's Veritaserum, a colorless, odorless potion thar forces the drinker to tell the truth,\" said Hermione. \"Very good, very good!\" said Slughorn happily. \"Now,\" he continued, pointing at the cauldron nearest the Ravenclaw table, \"this one here is pretty well known... Featured in a few Ministry leaflets lately too... Who can - ?\" Hermione's hand was fastest once more. \"lt's Polyjuice Potion, sir,\" she said. Harry too had recognized the slow-bubbling, mudlike substance the second cauldron, but did not resent Hermione getting the credit for answering the question; she, after all, was the one who had succeeded in making it, back in their second year. \"Excellent, excellent! Now, this one here . . . yes, my dear?\" said Slughorn, now looking slightly bemused, as Hermione's hand punched the air again. \"It's Amortentia!\" \"It is indeed. Ir seems almost foolish to ask,\" said Slughorn, who was looking mightily impressed, \"but I assume you know what it does?\" \"It's the most powerful love porion in the world!\" said Hermione. \"Quite right! You recognized it, I suppose, by its distinctive mother-of-pearl sheen?\" \"And the steam rising in characteristic spirals,\" said Hermione enthusiastically, \"and it's supposed to smell differently to each of according to what attracts us, and I can smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and -\" But she turned slightly pink and did not complete the sentence. 'May I ask your name, my dear?\" said Slughorn, ignoring Hermione's embarrassment. \"Hermione Granger, sir.\" \"Granger? Granger? Can you possibly be related to Hector Dagworth-Granger, who founded the Most Extraordinary Society of Potioneers?\" \"No. I don't think so, sir. I'm Muggle-born, you see.\" Harry saw Malfoy lean close to Nott and whisper something; both of them sniggered, but Slughorn showed no dismay; on the contrary, he beamed and looked from Hermione to Harry, who was sitting next to her. \"Oho! ‘One of my best friends is Muggle-born, and she's the best in our year!' I'm assuming this is the very friend of whom you spoke, Harry?\" \"Yes, sir,\" said Harry. \"Well, well, take twenty well-earned points for Gryffindor, Miss Granger,\" said Slughorn genially. Malfoy looked rather as he had done the time Hermione had punched him in the face. Hermione turned to Harry with a radiant expression and whispered, \"Did you really tell him I'm the best in the year? Oh, Harry!\" \"Well, what's so impressive about that?\" whispered Ron, who for some reason looked annoyed. \"You are the best in the year - I'd've told him so if he'd asked me!\" Hermione smiled but made a \"shhing\" gesture, so that they could hear what Slughorn was saying. Ron looked slightly disgruntled. \"Amortentia doesn't really create love, of course. It is impossible to manufacture or imitate love. No, this will simply cause a powerful infatuation or obsession. It is probably the most dangerous and powerful potion in this room - oh yes,\" he said, nodding gravely at Malfoy and Nott, both of whom were smirking skeptically. \"When you have seen as much of life as I have, you will not underestimate the power of obsessive love.\" \"And now,\" said Slughorn, \"it is time for us to start work.\" \"Sir, you haven't told us what's in this one,\" said Ernie Macmillan, pointing at a small black cauldron standing on Slughorn's desk. The potion within was splashing about merrily; it was the color of molten gold, and large drops were leaping like goldfish above the surface, though not a particle had spilled. \"Oho,\" said Slughorn again. Harry was sure that Slughorn had not forgotten the potion at all, but had waited to be asked for dramatic effect. \"Yes. That. Well, that one, ladies and gentlemen, is a most curious little potion called Felix Felicis. I take it,\" he turned, smiling, to look at Hermione, who had let out an audible gasp, \"that you know what Felix Felicis does, Miss Granger?\" \"It's liquid luck,\" said Hermione excitedly. \"It makes you lucky!\" The whole class seemed to sit up a little straighter. Now all Harry could see of Malfoy was the back of his sleek blond head, because he was at last giving Slughorn his full and undivided attention. \"Quite right, take another ten points for Gryffindor. Yes, it's a funny little potion, Felix Felicis,\" said Slughorn. \"Desperately tricky to make, and disastrous to get wrong. However, if brewed correctly, as this has been, you will find that all your endeavors tend to succeed ... at least until the effects wear off.\" \"Why don't people drink it all the time, sir?\" said Terry Boot eagerly. \"Because if taken in excess, it causes giddiness, recklessness, and dangerous overconfidence,\" said Slughorn. \"Too much of a good thing, you know. . . highly toxic in large quantities. But taken sparingly, and very occasionally . . .\" \"Have you ever taken it, sir?\" asked Michael Corner with great interest. \"Twice in my life,\" said Slughorn. \"Once when I was twenty-four, once when I was fifty-seven. Two tablespoonfuls taken with breakfast. Two perfect days.\" He gazed dreamily into the distance. Whether he was playacting or not, thought Harry, the effect was good. \"And that,\" said Slughorn, apparently coming back to earth, \"is what I shall be offering as a prize in this lesson.\" There was silence in which every bubble and gurgle of the surrounding potions seemed magnified tenfold. \"One tiny bottle of Felix Felicis,\" said Slughorn, taking a minuscule glass bottle with a cork in it out of his pocket and showing it to them all. \"Enough for twelve hours' luck. From dawn till dusk, you will be lucky in everything you attempt.\" \"Now, I must give you warning that Felix Felicis is a banned substance in organized competitions . . . sporting events, for instance, examinations, or elections. So the winner is to use it on an ordinary day only . . . and watch how that ordinary day becomes extraordinary!\" \"So,\" said Slughorn, suddenly brisk, \"how are you to win this fabulous prize? Well, by turning to page ten of Advanced Potion Making. We have a little over an hour left to us, which should be time for you to make a decent attempt at the Draught of Living Death. I know it is more complex than anything you have attempted before, and I do not expect a perfect potion from anybody. The person who does best, however, will win little Felix here. Off you go!\" There was a scraping as everyone drew their cauldrons toward them and some loud clunks as people began adding weights to their scales, but nobody spoke. The concentration within the room was almost tangible. Harry saw Malfoy riffling feverishly through his copy of Advanced Potion-Making., It could not have been clearer that Malfoy really wanted that lucky day. Harry bent swiftly over the tattered book Slughorn had lent him. To his annoyance he saw that the previous owner had scribbled all over the pages, so that the margins were as black as the printed portions. Bending low to decipher the ingredients (even here, the previous owner had made annotations and crossed things out) Harry hurried off toward the store cupboard to find what he needed. As he dashed back to his cauldron, he saw Malfoy cutting up Valerian roots as fast as he could. Everyone kept glancing around at what the rest of the class was doing; this was both an advantage and a disadvantage of Potions, that it was hard to keep your work private. Within ten minutes, the whole place was full of bluish steam. Hermione, of course, seemed to have progressed furthest. Her potion already resembled the \"smooth, black currant-colored liquid\" mentioned as the ideal halfway stage. Having finished chopping his roots, Harry bent low over his book again. It was really very irritating, having to try and decipher the directions under all the stupid scribbles of the previous owner, who for some reason had taken issue with the order to cut up the sopophorous bean and had written in the alternative instruction: Crush with flat side of silver dagger, releases juice better than cutting. \"Sir, I think you knew my grandfather, Abraxas Malfoy?\" Harry looked up; Slughorn was just passing the Slytherin table. \"Yes,\" said Slughorn, without looking at Malfoy, \"I was sorry to hear he had died, although of course it wasn't unexpected, dragon pox at his age...\" And he walked away. Harry bent back over his cauldron, smirking. He could tell that Malfoy had expected to be treated like Harry or Zabini; perhaps even hoped for some preferential treatment of the type he had learned to expect from Snape. It looked as though Malfoy would have to rely on nothing but talent to win the bottle of Felix Felicis. The sopophorous bean was proving very difficult to cut up. Harry turned to Hermione. \"Can I borrow your silver knife?\" She nodded impatiently, not taking her eyes off her potion, which was still deep purple, though according to the book ought to be turning a light shade of lilac by now. Harry crushed his bean with the flat side of the dagger. To his astonishment, it immediately exuded so much juice he was amazed the shriveled bean could have held it all. Hastily scooping it all into the cauldron he saw, to his surprise, that the potion immediately turned exactly the shade of lilac described by the textbook. His annoyance with the previous owner vanishing on the spot, Harry now squinted at the next line of instructions. According the book, he had to stir counterclockwise until the potion turned clear as water. According to the addition the previous owner made, however, he ought to add a clockwise stir after every seventh counterclockwise stir. Could the old owner be right twice? Harry stirred counterclockwise, held his breath, and stirred once clockwise. The effect was immediate. The potion turned pale pink. \"How are you doing that?\" demanded Hermione, who was redfaced and whose hair was growing bushier and bushier in the fumes from her cauldron; her potion was still resolutely purple. \"Add a clockwise stir -\" \"No, no, the book says counterclockwise!\" she snapped. Harry shrugged and continued what he was doing. Seven stirs counterdockwise, one clockwise, pause . . . seven stirs counterclockwise, one stir clockwise . . . Across the table, Ron was cursing fluently under his breath; his potion looked like liquid licorice. Harry glanced around. As far as he could see, no one else's potion had turned as pale as his. He felt elated, something that had certainly never happened before in this dungeon. \"And time's . . . up!\" called Slughorn. \"Stop stirring, please!\" Slughorn moved slowly among the tables, peering into cauldrons. He made no comment, but occasionally gave the potions a stir or a sniff. At last he reached the table where Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ernie were sitting. He smiled ruefully at the tarlike substance in Ron's cauldron. He passed over Ernie's navy concoction. Hermione's potion he gave an approving nod. Then he saw Harry's, and a look of incredulous delight spread over his face. \"The clear winner!\" he cried to the dungeon. \"Excellent, excellent, Harry! Good lord, it's clear you've inherited your mother's talent. She was a dab hand at Potions, Lily was! Here you are, then, here you are - one bottle of Felix Felicis, as promised, and use it well!\" Harry slipped the tiny bottle of golden liquid into his inner pocket, feeling an odd combination of delight at the furious looks on the Slytherins' faces and guilt at the disappointed expression on Hermione's. Ron looked simply dumbfounded. \"How did you do that?\" he whispered to Harry as they left the dungeon. \"Got lucky, I suppose,\" said Harry, because Malfoy was within earshot. Once they were securely ensconced at the Gryffindor table for dinner, however, he felt safe enough to tell them. Hermione's face became stonier with every word he uttered. \"I s'pose you think I cheated?\" he finished, aggravated by her expression. \"Well, it wasn't exactly your own work, was it?\" she said stiffly. \"He only followed different instructions to ours,\" said Ron, \"Could've been a catastrophe, couldn't it? But he took a risk and it paid off.\" He heaved a sigh. \"Slughorn could've handed me that book, but no, I get the one no one's ever written on. Puked on, by the look of page fifty-two, but-\" \"Hang on,\" said a voice close by Harry's left ear and he caught a sudden waft of that flowery smell he had picked up in Slughorn's dungeon. He looked around and saw that Ginny had joined them. \"Did I hear right? You've been taking orders from something someone wrote in a book, Harry?\" She looked alarmed and angry. Harry knew what was on her mind at once. \"It's nothing,\" he said reassuringly, lowering his voice. \"It's not like, you know, Riddle's diary. It's just an old textbook someone's scribbled on.\" \"But you're doing what it says?\" \"I just tried a few of the tips written in the margins, honestly, Ginny, there's nothing funny -\" \"Ginny's got a point,\" said Hermione, perking up at once. \"We ought to check that there's nothing odd about it. I mean, all these funny instructions, who knows?\" \"Hey!\" said Harry indignantly, as she pulled his copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bag and raised her wand. \"Specialis Revelio!\" she said, rapping it smartly on the front cover. Nothing whatsoever happened. The book simply lay there, looking old and dirty and dog-eared. \"Finished?\" said Harry irritably. \"Or d'you want to wait and see if it does a few backflips?\" \"It seems all right,\" said Hermione, still staring at the book suspiciously. \"I mean, it really does seem to be ... just a textbook.\" \"Good. Then I'll have it back,\" said Harry, snatching it off the table, but it slipped from his hand and landed open on the floor. Nobody else was looking. Harry bent low to retrieve the book, and as he did so, he saw something scribbled along the bottom of the back cover in the same small, cramped handwriting as the instructions that had won him his bottle of Felix Felicis, now safely hidden inside a pair of socks in his trunk upstairs. This book is the property of the Half Blood Prince. \n",

            ": Horcruxes Harry could feel the Felix Felicis wearing off as he creeped back into the castle. The front door had remained un locked for him, but on the third floor he met Peeves and only narrowly avoided detection by diving sideways through one of his shortcuts. By the time he got up to the portrait of the Fat Lady and pulled off his Invisibility Cloak, he was not surprised to find her in a most unhelpful mood. \"What sort of time do you call this?\" \"I'm really sorry -- I had to go out for something important --\" \"Well, the password changed at midnight, so you'll just have to sleep in the corridor, won't you?\" \"You're joking!\" said Harry. \"Why did it have to change at midnight?\" \"That's the way it is,\" said the Fat Lady. \"If you're angry, go and take it up with the headmaster, he's the one who's tightened security.\" \"Fantastic,\" said Harry bitterly, looking around at the hard floor. \"Really brilliant. Yeah, I would go and take it up with Dumbledore if he was here, because he's the one who wanted me to --\" \"He is here,\" said a voice behind Harry. \"Professor Dumbledore returned to the school an hour ago.\" Nearly Headless Nick was gliding toward Harry, his head wob-bling as usual upon his ruff. \"I had it from the Bloody Baron, who saw him arrive,\" said Nick. \"He appeared, according to the Baron, to be in good spirits, though a little tired, of course.\" \"Where is he?\" said Harry, his heart leaping,\" \"Oh, groaning and clanking up on the Astronomy Tower, it's a, favorite pastime of his --\" \"Not the Bloody Baron -- Dumbledore!\" \"Oh -- in his office,\" said Nick. \"I believe, from what the Baron said, that he had business to attend to before turning in --\" \"Yeah, he has,\" said Harry, excitement blazing in his chest at the prospect of telling Dumbledore he had secured the memory. He wheeled about and sprinted off again, ignoring the Fat Lady who was calling after him. \"Come back! All right, I lied! I was annoyed you woke me up! The password's still 'tapeworm'!\" But Harry was already hurtling back along the corridor and within minutes, he was saying \"toffee eclairs\" to Dumbledore's gar-goyle, which leapt aside, permitting Harry entrance onto the spiral staircase. \"Enter,\" said Dumbledore when Harry knocked. He sounded exhausted. Harry pushed open the door. There was Dumbledore's office, looking the same as ever, but with black, star-strewn skies beyond the windows. \"Good gracious, Harry,\" said Dumbledore in surprise. \"To what do I owe this very late pleasure?\" \"Sir -- I've got it. I’ve got the memory from Slughorn.\" Harry pulled out the tiny glass bottle and showed it to Dumbledore. For a moment or two, the headmaster looked stunned. Then his face split in a wide smile. \"Harry, this is spectacular news! Very well done indeed! I knew you could do it!\" All thought of the lateness of the hour apparently forgotten, he hurried around his desk, took the bottle with Slughorn's memory in his uninjured hand, and strode over to the cabinet where he kepi the Pensieve. \"And now,\" said Dumbledore, placing the stone basin upon the desk and emptying the contents of the bottle into it. \"Now, at last. we shall see. Harry, quickly . . .\" Harry bowed obediently over the Pensieve and felt his feet leave the office floor. . . . Once again he fell through darkness and landed in Horace Slughorn's office many years before. There was the much younger Slughorn, with his thick, shiny, straw-colored hair and his gingery-blond mustache, sitting again in the comfortable winged armchair in his office, his feet resting upon a velvet pouffe, a small glass of wine in one hand, the other rummaging in a box of crystallized pineapple. And there were the half dozen teenage boys sitting around Slughorn with Tom Riddle in the midst of them, Marvolo's gold-and-black ring gleaming on his finger. Dumbledore landed beside Harry just as Riddle asked, \"Sir is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?\" \"Tom, Tom, if I knew I couldn't tell you,\" said Slughorn, wag-ging his finger reprovingly at Riddle, though winking at the same time. \"I must say, I'd like to know where you get your information, boy, more knowledgeable than half the staff, you are.\" Riddle smiled; the other boys laughed and cast him admiring looks. \"What with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldn't, and your careful flattery of the people who matter -- thank you for the pineapple, by the way, you're quite right, it is my favorite --\" Several of the boys tittered again. \"-- I confidently expect you to rise to Minister of Magic within twenty years. Fifteen, if you keep sending me pineapple, I have ex-cellent contacts at the Ministry.\" Tom Riddle merely smiled as the others laughed again. Harry noticed that he was by no means the eldest of the group of boys, but that they all seemed to look to him as their leader. \"I don't know that politics would suit me, sir,\" he said when the laughter had died away. \"I don't have the right kind of background, for one thing.\" A couple of the boys around him smirked at each other. Harry was sure they were enjoying a private joke, undoubtedly about what they knew, or suspected, regarding their gang leader's famous ancestor. \"Nonsense,\" said Slughorn briskly, \"couldn't be plainer you come from decent Wizarding stock, abilities like yours. No, you'll go far, Tom, I've never been wrong about a student yet.\" The small golden clock standing upon Slughorn's desk chimed eleven o'clock behind him and he looked around. \"Good gracious, is it that time already? You'd better get going boys, or we'll all be in trouble. Lestrange, I want your essay by in morrow or it's detention. Same goes for you, Avery.\" One by one, the boys filed out of the room. Slughorn heaved himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk. A movement behind him made him look around; Riddle was still standing there. \"Look shar p, Tom, you don't want to be caught out of bed out of hours, and you a prefect.. .\" \"Sir, I wanted to ask you something.\" -' \"Ask away, then, m'boy, ask away. . . .\" \"Sir, I wondered what you know about. . . about Horcruxes?' Slughorn stared at him, his thick ringers absentmindedly clawing the stem of his wine glass. \"Project for Defense Against the Dark Arts, is it?\" But Harry could tell that Slughorn knew perfectly well that this was not schoolwork. \"Not exactly, sir,\" said Riddle. \"I came across the term while reading and I didn't fully understand it.\" \"No . . . well. . . you'd be hard-pushed to find a book at Hogwarts that'll give you details on Horcruxes, Tom, that's very Dark stuff, very Dark indeed,\" said Slughorn. \"But you obviously know all about them, sir? I mean, a wizard like you -- sorry, I mean, if you can't tell me, obviously -- I just knew if anyone could tell me, you could -- so I just thought I'd –\" It was very well done, thought Harry, the hesitancy, the casual tone, the careful flattery, none of it overdone. He, Harry, had had too much experience of trying to wheedle information out of re-luctant people not to recognize a master at work. He could tell that Riddle wanted the information very, very much; perhaps had been working toward this moment for weeks. \"Well,\" said Slughorn, not looking at Riddle, but fiddling with the ribbon on top of his box of crystallized pineapple, \"well, it can't hurt to give you an overview, of course. Just so that you understand t he term. A Horcrux is the word used for an object in which a per-son has concealed part of their soul.\" \"I don't quite understand how that works, though, sir,\" said Riddle. His voice was carefully controlled, but Harry could sense his excitement. \"Well, you split your soul, you see,\" said Slughorn, \"and hide part of it in an object outside the body. Then, even if one's body is attacked or destroyed, one cannot die, for part of the soul remains earthbound and undamaged. But of course, existence in such a form ...\" Slughorn's face crumpled and Harry found himself remember-ing words he had heard nearly two years before: \"I was ripped from my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost. . . but still, I was alive.\" \"... few would want it, Tom, very few. Death would be preferable.\" But Riddle's hunger was now apparent; his expression was greedy, he could no longer hide his longing. \"How do you split your soul?\" \"Well,\" said Slughorn uncomfortably, \"you must understand that the soul is supposed to remain intact and whole. Splitting n it I an act of violation, it is against nature.\" \"But how do you do it?\" \"By an act of evil -- the supreme act of evil. By commiting murder. Killing rips the soul apart. The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would use the damage to his advantage: He would encase the torn portion --\" \"Encase? But how -- ?\" \"There is a spell, do not ask me, I don't know!\" said Slughoin shaking his head like an old elephant bothered by mosquitoes. \" Do I look as though I have tried it -- do I look like a killer?\" \"No, sir, of course not,\" said Riddle quickly. \"I'm sorry ... I didn't mean to offend . . .\" \"Not at all, not at all, not offended,\" said Slughorn gruffly, \"It is natural to feel some curiosity about these things. . . . Wizards of a certain caliber have always been drawn to that aspect of magic. . . .\" \"Yes, sir,\" said Riddle. \"What I don't understand, though -- just out of curiosity -- I mean, would one Horcrux be much use? Can you only split your soul once? Wouldn't it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces, I mean, for instance, isn't seven the most powerfully magical number, wouldn't seven -- ?\" \"Merlin's beard, Tom!\" yelped Slughorn. \"Seven! Isn't it bad enough to think of killing one person? And in any case . . . bad enough to divide the soul . . . but to rip it into seven pieces . . .\" Slughorn looked deeply troubled now: He was gazing at Riddle as though he had never seen him plainly before, and Harry could tell that he was regretting entering into the conversation at all. \"Of course,\" he muttered, \"this is all hypothetical, what we're discussing, isn't it? All academic . . .\" \"Yes, sir, of course,\" said Riddle quickly. \"But all the same, Tom . . . keep it quiet, what I've told -- that's to say, what we've discussed. People wouldn't like to think we've been chatting about Horcruxes. It's a banned subject at Hogwarts, you know. . . . Dumbledore's particularly fierce about it. ...\" \"I won't say a word, sir,\" said Riddle, and he left, but not before Harry had glimpsed his face, which was full of that same wild hap-piness it had worn when he had first found out that he was a wiz-ard, the sort of happiness that did not enhance his handsome features, but made them, somehow, less human. . . . \"Thank you, Harry,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"Let us go. . . .\" When Harry landed back on the office floor Dumbledore was ; already sitting down behind his desk. Harry sat too and waited for Dumbledore to speak. \"I have been hoping for this piece of evidence for a very long time,\" said Dumbledore at last. \"It confirms the theory on which I have been working, it tells me that I am right, and also how very far there is still to go. ...\" Harry suddenly noticed that every single one of the old head-masters and headmistresses in the portraits around the walls was awake and listening in on their conversation. A corpulent, red nosed wizard had actually taken out an ear trumpet. \"Well, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, \"I am sure you understood the significance of what we just heard. At the same age as you are now, give or take a few months, Tom Riddle was doing all he could to find out how to make himself immortal.\" \"You think he succeeded then, sir?\" asked Harry. \"He made a Horcrux? And that's why he didn't die when he attacked me? He had a Horcrux hidden somewhere? A bit of his soul was safe?\" \"A bit... or more,\" said Dumbledore. \"You heard Voldemort, what he particularly wanted from Horace was an opinion on what would happen to the wizard who created more than one Horcrux, what would happen to the wizard so determined to evade death that he would be prepared to murder many times, rip his soul repeatedly, so as to store it in many, separately concealed Horcruxc. No book would have given him that information. As far as I know -- as far, I am sure, as Voldemort knew -- no wizard had ever done more than tear his soul in two.\" Dumbledore paused for a moment, marshaling his thought, and then said, \"Four years ago, I received what I considered certain proof that Voldemort had split his soul.\" \"Where?\" asked Harry. \"How?\" \"You handed it to me, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. \"The diary, Riddles diary, the one giving instructions on how to reopen the Chamber of Secrets.\" \"I don't understand, sir,\" said Harry. \"Well, although I did not see the Riddle who came out of the di-ary, what you described to me was a phenomenon I had never wit-nessed. A mere memory starting to act and think for itself? A mere memory, sapping the life out of the girl into whose hands it had fallen? No, something much more sinister had lived inside that book. ... a fragment of soul, I was almost sure of it. The diary had been a Horcrux. But this raised as many questions as it answered. What intrigued and alarmed me most was that that diary had been intended as a weapon as much as a safeguard.\" \"1 still don't understand,\" said Harry. \"Well, it worked as a Horcrux is supposed to work -- in other words, the fragment of soul concealed inside it was kept safe and had undoubtedly played its part in preventing the death of its owner. But there could be no doubt that Riddle really wanted that diary read, wanted the piece of his soul to inhabit or possess some-body else, so that Slytherin's monster would be unleashed again.\" \"Well, he didn't want his hard work to be wasted,\" said Harry. \"He wanted people to know he was Slytherin's heir, because he couldn't take credit at the time.\" \"Quite correct,\" said Dumbledore, nodding. \"But don't you see, Harry, that if he intended the diary to be passed to, or planted on, some future Hogwarts student, he was being remarkably blase about that precious fragment of his soul concealed within it. The point of a Horcrux is, as Professor Slughorn explained, to keep part of the self hidden and safe, not to fling it into somebody else's path and run the risk that they might destroy it -- as indeed happened: That particular fragment of soul is no more; you saw to that. The careless way in which Voldemort regarded this Horcrux seemed most ominous to me. It suggested that he must have made -- or had been planning to make -- more Horcruxes, so that the loss of his first would not be so detrimental. I did not wish to be-lieve it, but nothing else seemed to make sense. Then you told me, two years later, that on the night that Volde-mort returned to his body, he made a most illuminating and alarm-ing statement to his Death Eaters. ‘I who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality.’ That was what you told me he said. 'Further than anybody!' And I thought I knew what that meant, though the Death Eaters did not. He was referring to his Horcruxes, Horcruxes in the plural, Harry, which I don’t believe any other wizard has ever had. Yet it fitted: Lord Voldomort has seemed to grow less human with the passing years, and the transformation he had undergone seemed to me to be only explainable if his soul was mutilated beyond the realms of what we might call 'usual evil' . . .\" \"So he's made himself impossible to kill by murdering other people?\" said Harry. \"Why couldn't he make a Sorcerer's Stone, or steal one, if he was so interested in immortality?\" \"Well, we know that he tried to do just that, five years ago,\" s;n«l Dumbledore. \"But there are several reasons why, I think, a Sorcerer's Stone would appeal less than Horcruxes to Lord Voldemort, \"While the Elixir of Life does indeed extend life, it must lie drunk regularly, for all eternity, if the drinker is to maintain the immortality. Therefore, Voldemort would be entirely dependant on the Elixir, and if it ran out, or was contaminated, or if the Stone was stolen, he would die just like any other man. Voldemort likes to operate alone, remember. I believe that he would have found the thought of being dependent, even on the Elixir, intolerable. Of course he was prepared to drink it if it would take him out of the horrible part-life to which he was condemned after attacking you, but only to regain a body. Thereafter, I am convinced, he intended to continue to rely on his Horcruxes. He would need nothing more, if only he could regain a human form. He was already im-mortal, you see ... or as close to immortal as any man can be. But now, Harry, armed with this information, the crucial memory you have succeeded in procuring for us, we are closer to the se-cret of finishing Lord Voldemort than anyone has ever been before. You heard him, Harry: 'Wouldn't it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces . . . isn't seven the most powerfully magical number . . .' Isn't seven the most powerfully magical number. Yes, I think the idea of a seven-part soul would greatly appeal to Lord Voldemort.\" \"He made seven Horcruxes?\" said Harry, horror-struck, while several of the portraits on the walls made similar noises of shock mid outrage. \"But they could be anywhere in the world -- hidden -- buried or invisible --\" \"I am glad to see you appreciate the magnitude of the problem,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"But firstly, no, Harry, not seven Hor-cruxes: six. The seventh part of his soul, however maimed, resides inside his regenerated body. That was the part of him that lived a spectral existence for so many years during his exile; without that, he has no self at all. That seventh piece of soul will be the last that anybody wishing to kill Voldemort must attack -- the piece that lives in his body.\" \"But the six Horcruxes, then,\" said Harry, a little desperately, \"how are we supposed to find them?\" \"You are forgetting . . . you have already destroyed one of them. And I have destroyed another.\" \"You have?\" said Harry eagerly. \"Yes indeed,\" said Dumbledore, and he raised his blackened, burned-looking hand. \"The ring, Harry. Marvolo's ring. And a ter-rible curse there was upon it too. Had it not been -- forgive me the lack of seemly modesty -- for my own prodigious skill, and for Professor Snape's timely action when I returned to Hogwarts, des-perately injured, I might not have lived to tell the tale. However, a withered hand does not seem an unreasonable exchange for a sev-enth of Voldemort's soul. The ring is no longer a Horcrux.\" \"But how did you find it?\" \"Well, as you now know, for many years I have made it my business to discover as much as I can about Voldemort's past life. I have traveled widely, visiting those places he once knew. I stumbled across the ring hidden in the ruin of the Gaunt’s house. It seem that once Voldemort had succeeded in sealing a piece of his soul in side it, he did not want to wear it anymore. He hid it, protected by many powerful enchantments, in the shack where his ancestors had once lived (Morfin having been carted off to Azkaban, of course), never guessing that I might one day take the trouble to visit the ruin, or that I might be keeping an eye open for traces of magical concealment. \"However, we should not congratulate ourselves too heartily. You destroyed the diary and I the ring, but if we are right in our theory of a seven-part soul, four Horcruxes remain.\" \"And they could be anything?\" said Harry. \"They could be oh, in tin cans or, I dunno, empty potion bottles. . . .\" \"You are thinking of Portkeys, Harry, which must be ordinary objects, easy to overlook. But would Lord Voldemort use tin cans or old potion bottles to guard his own precious soul? You are forgetting what I have showed you. Lord Voldemort liked to collect trophies, and he preferred objects with a powerful magical history His pride, his belief in his own superiority, his determination to carve for himself a startling place in magical history; these things, suggest to me that Voldemort would have chosen his Horcruxr with some care, favoring objects worthy of the honor.\" \"The diary wasn't that special.\" \"The diary, as you have said yourself, was proof that he was the Hire of Slytherin. I am sure that Voldemort considered it of stu-pendous importance.\" \"So, the other Horcruxes?\" said Harry. \"Do you think you know what they are, sir?\" \"I can only guess,\" said Dumbledore. \"For the reasons I have al-ready given, I believe that Lord Voldemort would prefer objects that, in themselves, have a certain grandeur. I have therefore trawled back through Voldemort's past to see if I can find evidence that such artifacts have disappeared around him.\" \"The locket!\" said Harry loudly, \"Hufflepuff's cup!\" \"Yes,\" said Dumbledore, smiling, \"I would be prepared to bet -- perhaps not my other hand -- but a couple of fingers, that they be-came Horcruxes three and four. The remaining two, assuming again that he created a total of six, are more of a problem, but I will hazard a guess that, having secured objects from Hufflepuff and Slytherin, he set out to track down objects owned by Gryffindor or Ravenclaw. Four objects from the four founders would, I am sure, have exerted a powerful pull over Voldemort's imagination. I can-not answer for whether he ever managed to find anything of Ravenclaw's. I am confident, however, that the only known relic of Gryffindor remains safe.\" Dumbledore pointed his blackened fingers to the wall behind him, where a ruby-encrusted sword reposed within a glass case. \"Do you think that's why he really wanted to come back to Hogwarts, sir?\" said Harry. \"To try and find something from one of the other founders?\" \"My thoughts precisely,\" said Dumbledore. \"But unfortunately, that does not advance us much further, for he was turned away, or so I believe, without the chance to search the school. I am forced to conclude that he never fulfilled his ambition of collecting four founders' objects. He definitely had two -- he may have found three -- that is the best we can do for now.\" \"Even if he got something of Ravenclaw's or of Gryffindor's, that leaves a sixth Horcrux,\" said Harry, counting on his fingers. \"Unless he’s got both?\" \"I don't think so,\" said Dumbledore. \"I think I know what the sixth Horcrux is. I wonder what you will say when I confess that I have been curious for a while about the behavior of the snake, Nagini?' \"The snake?\" said Harry, startled. \"You can use animals as Horcruxes?\" \"Well, it is inadvisable to do so,\" said Dumbledore, \"because to confide a part of your soul to something that can think and move for itself is obviously a very risky business. However, if my calculations are correct, Voldemort was still at least one Horcrux short of his goal of six when he entered your parents' house with the inten-tion of killing you. He seems to have reserved the process of making Horcruxes for particularly significant deaths. You would certainly have been that. He believed that in killing you, he was destroying the danger the prophecy had outlined. He believed he was making himself invin-cible. I am sure that he was intending to make his final Horcrux with your death. As we know, he failed. After an interval of some years, however, he used Nagini to kill an old Muggle man, and it might then have occurred to him to turn her into his last Horcrux. She underlines the Slytherin connection, which enhances Lord Voldemorts mys-tique; I think he is perhaps as fond of her as he can be of anything; he certainly likes to keep her close, and he seems to have an un-usual amount of control over her, even for a Parselmouth.\" \"So,\" said Harry, \"the diary's gone, the ring's gone. The cup, the locket, and the snake are still intact, and you think there might be a Horcrux that was once Ravenclaw's or Gryffindor's?\" \"An admirably succinct and accurate summary, yes,\" said Dum-bledore, bowing his head. \"So . . . are you still looking for them, sir? Is that where you've been going when you've been leaving the school?\" \"Correct,\" said Dumbledore. \"I have been looking for a very long time. I think. . . perhaps ... I may be close to finding an-other one. There are hopeful signs.\" \"And if you do,\" said Harry quickly, \"can I come with you and help get rid of it?\" Dumbledore looked at Harry very intently for a moment before saying, \"Yes, I think so.\" \"I can?\" said Harry, thoroughly taken aback. \"Oh yes,\" said Dumbledore, smiling slightly. \"I think you have earned that right.\" Harry felt his heart lift. It was very good not to hear words of caution and protection for once. The headmasters and head-mistresses around the walls seemed less impressed by Dumbledore's decision; Harry saw a few of them shaking their heads and Phineas Nigellus actually snorted. \"Does Voldemort know when a Horcrux is destroyed, sir? Can he feel it?\" Harry asked, ignoring the portraits. \"A very interesting question, Harry. I believe not. I believe that Voldemort is now so immersed in evil, and these crucial parts of himself have been detached for so long, he does not feel as we do. Perhaps, at the point of death, he might be aware of his loss . . . but he was not aware, for instance, that the diary had been destroyed until he forced the truth out of Lucius Malfoy. When Voldemort discovered that the diary had been mutilated and robbed of all its powers, I am told that his anger was terrible to behold.\" \"But I thought he meant Lucius Malfoy to smuggle it into Hogwarts?\" \"Yes, he did, years ago, when he was sure he would be able to create more Horcruxes, but still Lucius was supposed to wait for Voldemorts say-so, and he never received it, for Voldemort van-ished shortly after giving him the diary. No doubt he thought that Lucius would not dare do anything with the Horcrux other than guard it carefully, but he was counting too much upon Lucius’s fear of a master who had been gone for years and whom Lucius believed dead. Of course, Lucius did not know what the diary really was. I understand that Voldemort had told him the diary would cause the Chamber of Secrets to reopen because it was cleverly enchanted. Had Lucius known he held a portion of his mas-ters soul in his hands, he would undoubtedly have treated it with more reverence -- but instead he went ahead and carried out the old plan for his own ends. By planting the diary upon Arthur Weasleys daughter, he hoped to discredit Arthur and get rid of a highly incrim-inating magical object in one stroke. Ah, poor Lucius . . . what with Voldemorts fury about the fact that he threw away the Horcrux for his own gain, and the fiasco at the Ministry last year, I would not be sur-prised if he is not secretly glad to be safe in Azkaban at the moment.\" Harry sat in thought for a moment, then asked, \"So if all of his Horcruxes are destroyed, Voldemort couldbe killed?\" \"Yes, I think so,\" said Dumbledore. \"Without his Horcruxes, Voldemort will be a mortal man with a maimed and diminished soul. Never forget, though, that while his soul may be damaged be-yond repair, his brain and his magical powers remain intact. It will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like Voldemort even without his Horcruxes.\" \"But I haven't got uncommon skill and power,\" said Harry, be-fore he could stop himself. \"Yes, you have,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"You have a power that Voldemort has never had. You can --\" \"I know!\" said Harry impatiently. \"I can love!\" It was only with difficulty that he stopped himself adding, \"Big deal!\" \"Yes, Harry, you can love,\" said Dumbledore, who looked as though he knew perfectly well what Harry had just refrained from saying. \"Which, given everything that has happened to you, is a great and remarkable thing. You are still too young to understand how unusual you are, Harry.\" \"So, when the prophecy says that I'll have 'power the Dark Lord knows not,' it just means -- love?\" asked Harry, feeling a little let down. \"Yes -- just love,\" said Dumbledore. \"But Harry, never forget that what the prophecy says is only significant because Voldemort made it so. I told you this at the end of last year. Voldemort singled you out as the person who would be most dangerous to him -- and in doing so, he made you the person who would be most dan-gerous to him!\" \"But it comes to the same --\" \"No, it doesn't!\" said Dumbledore, sounding impatient now. Pointing at Harry with his black, withered hand, he said, \"You are setting too much store by the prophecy!\" \"But,\" spluttered Harry, \"but you said the prophecy means --\" \"If Voldemort had never heard of the prophecy, would it have been fulfilled? Would it have meant anything? Of course not! Ho you think every prophecy in the Hall of Prophecy has been fulfilled?\" \"But,\" said Harry, bewildered, \"but last year, you said one of us would have to kill the other --\" \"Harry, Harry, only because Voldemort made a grave error, and acted on Professor Trelawney's words! If Voldemort had never murdered your father, would he have imparted in you a furious desire for revenge? Of course not! If he had not forced your mother to die for you, would he have given you a magical protection he could not penetrate? Of course not, Harry! Don't you see? Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back! Voldemort is no different! Always he was on the lookout for the one who would challenge him. He heard the prophecy and he leapt into ac-tion, with the result that he not only handpicked the man most likely to finish him, he handed him uniquely deadly weapons!\" \"But --\" \"It is essential that you understand this!\" said Dumbledore, standing up and striding about the room, his glittering robes swooshing in his wake; Harry had never seen him so agitated. \"By attempting to kill you, Voldemort himself singled out the remark-able person who sits here in front of me, and gave him the tools for the job! It is Voldemort's fault that you were able to see into his thoughts, his ambitions, that you even understand the snakelike language in which he gives orders, and yet, Harry, despite your privileged insight into Voldemort's world (which, incidentally, is a gift any Death Eater would kill to have), you have never been se-duced by the Dark Arts, never, even for a second, shown the slight-est desire to become one of Voldemort's followers!\" \"Of course I haven't!\" said Harry indignantly. \"He killed my mum and dad!\" \"You are protected, in short, by your ability to love!\" said Dum-bledore loudly. \"The only protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like Voldemort's! In spite of all the temptation you have endured, all the suffering, you remain pure of heart, just as pure as you were at the age of eleven, when you stared into a mir-ror that reflected your heart's desire, and it showed you only the way to thwart Lord Voldemort, and not immortality or riches. Harry, have you any idea how few wizards could have seen what you saw in that mirror? Voldemort should have known then what he was dealing with, but he did not! But he knows it now. You have flitted into Lord Voldemort's mind without damage to yourself, but he cannot possess you with-out enduring mortal agony, as he discovered in the Ministry. I do not think he understands why, Harry, but then, he was in such a hurry to mutilate his own soul, he never paused to understand the incomparable power of a soul that is untarnished and whole.\" \"But, sir,\" said Harry, making valiant efforts not to sound argu-mentative, \"it all comes to the same thing, doesn't it? I've got to try and kill him, or --\" \"Got to?\" said Dumbledore. \"Of course you've got to! But not because of the prophecy! Because you, yourself, will never rest until you've tried! We both know it! Imagine, please, just for a moment, that you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think!\" Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front ol him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father, and Sinus. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat. \"I'd want him finished,\" said Harry quietly. \"And I'd want to do it.\" \"Of course you would!\" cried Dumbledore. \"You see, the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal. ... In other words, you are free to choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! But Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy. He will continue to hunt you . . . which makes it certain, really, that --\" \"That one of us is going to end up killing the other,\" said Harry. \"Yes.\" But he understood at last what Dumbledore had been trying to tell him. It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumble-dore knew -- and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents -- that there was all the difference in the world. \n",

            ": AVeryFrosty Christmas \"So Snape was offering to help him? He was definitely offering to help him?\" \"If you ask. that once more,\" said Harry, \"I'm going to stick this sprout --\" \"I'm only checking!\" said Ron. They were standing alone at the Burrow's kitchen sink, peeling a mountain of sprouts for Mrs. Weasley. Snow was drifting past the window in front of them. \"Yes, Snape was offering to help him!\" said Harry. \"He said he'd promised Malfoy's mother to protect him, that he'd made an Un-breakable Oath or something --\" \"An Unbreakable Vow?\" said Ron, looking stunned. \"Nah, he can't have. . . . Are you sure?\" \"Yes, I'm sure,\" said Harry. \"Why, what does it mean?\" \"Well, you can't break an Unbreakable Vow. . . .\" \"I'd worked that much out for myself, funnily enough. What happens if you break it, then?\" \"You die,\" said Ron simply. \"Fred and George tried to get me to make one when I was about five. I nearly did too, I was holding hands with Fred and everything when Dad found us. He went mental,\" said Ron, with a reminiscent gleam in his eyes. \"Only time I've ever seen Dad as angry as Mum, Fred reckons his left but-tock has never been the same since.\" \"Yeah, well, passing over Fred's left buttock --\" \"I beg your pardon?\" said Fred's voice as the twins entered the kitchen. \"Aaah, George, look at this. They're using knives and everything. Bless them.\" \"I'll be seventeen in two and a bit months' time,\" said Ron grumpily, \"and then I'll be able to do it by magic!\" \"But meanwhile,\" said George, sitting down at the kitchen table and putting his feet up on it, \"we can enjoy watching you demon-strate the correct use of a -- whoops-a-daisy!\" \"You made me do that!\" said Ron angrily, sucking his cut thumb. \"You wait, when I'm seventeen --\" \"I'm sure you'll dazzle us all with hitherto unsuspected magical skills,\" yawned Fred. \"And speaking of hitherto unsuspected skills, Ronald,\" said George, \"what is this we hear from Ginny about you and a young lady called -- unless our information is faulty -- Lavender Brown?\" Ron turned a little pink, but did not look displeased as he turned back to the sprouts. \"Mind your own business.\" \"What a snappy retort,\" said Fred. \"I really don't know how you think of them. No, what we wanted to know was... how did it happen?\" \"What d'you mean?\" \"Did she have an accident or something?\" \"What?\" ..¦; \"Well, how did she sustain such extensive brain damage? Care-ful, now!\" Mrs. Weasley entered the room just in time to see Ron throw the sprout knife at Fred, who had turned it into a paper airplane with one lazy flick of his wand, \"Ron!\" she said furiously. \"Don't you ever let me see you throw-ing knives again!\" \"I wont,\" said Ron, \"let you see,\" he added under his breath, as he turned back to the sprout mountain. \"Fred, George, I'm sorry, dears, but Remus is arriving tonight, so Bill will have to squeeze in with you two.\" ; \"No problem,\" said George. - \"Then, as Charlie isn't coming home, that just leaves Harry and ;¦/ Ron in the attic, and if Fleur shares with Ginny --\" \"-- that'll make Ginny's Christmas --\" muttered Fred. \"-- everyone should be comfortable. Well, they'll have a bed, anyway,\" said Mrs. Weasley, sounding slightly harassed. \"Percy definitely not showing his ugly face, then?\" asked Fred. Mrs. Weasley turned away before she answered. \"No, he's busy, I expect, at the Ministry.\" \"Or he's the world's biggest prat,\" said Fred, as Mrs. Weasley left the kitchen. \"One of the two. \"Well, let's get going, then, George.\" \"What are you two up to?\" asked Ron. \"Cant you help us with these sprouts? You could just use your wand and then we'll be free too!\" \"No, I don't think we can do that,\" said Fred seriously. \"It's very character-building stuff, learning to peel sprouts without magic, makes you appreciate how difficult it is for Muggles and Squibs --\" \"-- and if you want people to help you, Ron,\" added George, throwing the paper airplane at him, \"I wouldn't chuck knives at them. Just a little hint. We're off to the village, there's a very pretty girl working in the paper shop who thinks my card tricks are some-thing marvelous . . , almost like real magic. ...\" \"Gits,\" said Ron darkly, watching Fred and George setting off across the snowy yard. \"Would've only taken them ten seconds and then we could've gone too.\" \"I couldn't,\" said Harry. \"I promised Dumbledore I wouldn't wander off while I'm staying here.\" \"Oh yeah,\" said Ron. He peeled a few more sprouts and then said, \"Are you going to tell Dumbledore what you heard Snape and Malfoy saying to each other?\" \"Yep,\" said Harry. \"I'm going to tell anyone who can put a stop to it, and Dumbledore’s top of the list. I might have another word with your dad too.\" \"Pity you didn't hear what Malfoy’s actually doing, though.\" \"I couldn't have done, could I? That was the whole point, he was refusing to tell Snape.\" There was silence for a moment or two, then Ron said, \" 'Course, you know what they'll all say? Dad and Dumbledore and all of them? They'll say Snape isn't really trying to help Malfoy, he was just trying to find out what Malfoy's up to.\" \"They didn't hear him,\" said Harry flatly. \"No one's that good an actor, not even Snape.\" \"Yeah . . . I'm just saying, though/' said Ron. Harry turned to face him, frowning. \"You think I'm right, though?\" , \"Yeah, I do!\" said Ron hastily. \"Seriously, I do! But they're all convinced Snape's in the Order, aren't they?\" Harry said nothing. It had already occurred to him that this would be the most likely objection to his new evidence; he could hear Hermione now: Obviously, Harry, he was pretending to offer help so he could trick Malfoy into telling him what he's doing. . . . This was pure imagination, however, as he had had no opportu-nity to tell Hermione what he had overheard. She had disappeared from Slughorn's party before he returned to it, or so he had been informed by an irate McLaggen, and she had already gone to bed by the time he returned to the common room. As he and Ron had left for the Burrow early the next day, he had barely had time to wish her a happy Christmas and to tell her that he had some very important news when they got back from the holidays. He was not entirely sure that she had heard him, though; Ron and Lavender had been saying a thoroughly nonverbal good-bye just behind him at the time. Still, even Hermione would not be able to deny one thing: Mal-foy was definitely up to something, and Snape knew it, so Harry felt fully justified in saying \"I told you so,\" which he had done sev-eral times to Ron already. Harry did not get the chance to speak to Mr. Weasley, who was working very long hours at the Ministry, until Christmas Eve night. The Weasleys and their guests were sitting in the living room, which Ginny had decorated so lavishly that it was rather like sitting in a paper-chain explosion. Fred, George, Harry, and Ron were the only ones who knew that the angel on top of the tree was actually a garden gnome that had bitten Fred on the ankle as hr pulled up carrots for Christmas dinner. Stupefied, painted gold, stuffed into a miniature tutu and with small wings glued to il.s back, it glowered down at them all, the ugliest angel Harry had ever seen, with a large bald head like a potato and rather hairy feet. They were all supposed to be listening to a Christmas broadcast by Mrs. Weasleys favorite singer, Celestina Warbeck, whose voice was warbling out of the large wooden wireless set. Fleur, who seemed to find Celestina very dull, was talking so loudly in the corner that a scowling Mrs. Weasley kept pointing her wand at the volume con-trol, so that Celestina grew louder and louder. Under cover of a par-ticularly jazzy number called \"A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love,\" Fred and George started a game of Exploding Snap with Ginny. Ron kept shooting Bill and Fleur covert looks, as though hoping to pick up tips. Meanwhile, Remus Lupin, who was thinner and more ragged-looking than ever, was sitting beside the fire, staring into its depths as though he could not hear Celestinas voice. Oh, come and stir my cauldron, And if you do it right, I'll boil you up some hot strong love To keep you warm tonight. \"We danced to this when we were eighteen!\" said Mrs. Weasley, wiping her eyes on her knitting. \"Do you remember, Arthur?\" \"Mphf?\" said Mr. Weasley, whose head had been nodding over the satsuma he was peeling. \"Oh yes ... marvelous tune . . .\" With an effort, he sat up a little straighter and looked around at Harry, who was sitting next to him. \"Sorry about this,\" he said, jerking his head toward the wireless as Celestina broke into the chorus. \"Be over soon.\" \"No problem,\" said Harry, grinning. \"Has it been busy at the Ministry?\" \"Very,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"I wouldn't mind if we were getting anywhere, but of the three arrests we've made in the last couple of months, I doubt that one of them is a genuine Death Eater -- only don't repeat that, Harry,\" he added quickly, looking much more awake all of a sudden. \"They're not still holding Stan Shunpike, are they?\" asked Harry. \"I'm afraid so,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"I know Dumbledore's tried appealing directly to Scrimgeour about Stan. ... I mean, anybody who has actually interviewed him agrees that he's about as much a Death Eater as this satsuma . . . but the top levels want to look as though they're making some progress, and 'three arrests' sounds better than 'three mistaken arrests and releases'. . . but again, this is all top secret. . . .\" \"I won't say anything,\" said Harry. He hesitated for a moment, wondering how best to embark on what he wanted to say; as he marshaled his thoughts, Celestina Warbeck began a ballad called \"You Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me.\" \"Mr. Weasley, you know what I told you at the station when we were setting off for school?\" \"I checked, Harry,\" said Mr. Weasley at once. \"I went and searched the Malfoys' house. There was nothing, either broken or whole, that shouldn't have been there.\" \"Yeah, I know, I saw in the Prophet that you'd looked . . . but this is something different. . . . Well, something more ...\" And he told Mr. Weasley everything he had overheard between Malfoy and Snape, As Harry spoke, he saw Lupin's head turn a lit-tle toward him, taking in every word. When he had finished, there was silence, except for Celestina's crooning. Oh, my poor heart, where has it gone? It's left me for a spell... \"Has it occurred to you, Harry,\" said Mr. Weasley, \"that Snape was simply pretending -- ?\" \"Pretending to offer help, so that he could find out what Malfoy's up to?\" said Harry quickly. \"Yeah, I thought you'd say that. But how do we know?\" \"It isn't our business to know,\" said Lupin unexpectedly. He had turned his back on the fire now and faced Harry across Mr. Weasley. \"It's Dumbledore’s business. Dumbledore trusts Severus, and that ought to be good enough for all of us.\" \"But,\" said Harry, \"just say -- just say Dumbledores wrong about Snape --\" \"People have said it, many times. It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore’s judgment. I do; therefore, I trust Severus.\" \"But Dumbledore can make mistakes,\" argued Harry. \"He says it himself. And you\" -- he looked Lupin straight in the eye -- \"do you honestly like Snape?\" \"I neither like nor dislike Severus,\" said Lupin. \"No, Harry, I am speaking the truth,\" he added, as Harry pulled a skeptical expres-sion. \"We shall never be bosom friends, perhaps; after all that hap-pened between James and Sirius and Severus, there is too much bitterness there. But I do not forget that during the year I taught at Hogwarts, Severus made the Wolfsbane Potion for me every month, made it perfectly, so that I did not have to suffer as I usu-ally do at the full moon.\" \"But he 'accidentally' let it slip that you're a werewolf, so you had to leave!\" said Harry angrily. Lupin shrugged. \"The news would have leaked out anyway. We both know he wanted my job, but he could have wreaked much worse damage on me by tampering with the potion. He kept me healthy. I must be grateful.\" \"Maybe he didn't dare mess with the potion with Dumbledore watching him!\" said Harry. \"You are determined to hate him, Harry,\" said Lupin with a faint smile. \"And I understand; with James as your father, with Sir-ius as your godfather, you have inherited an old prejudice. By all means tell Dumbledore what you have told Arthur and me, but do not expect him to share your view of the matter; do not even expect him to be surprised by what you tell him. It might have been on Dumbledore's orders that Severus questioned Draco.\" ; . . . and now you've torn it quite apart I'll thank you to give back my heart! Celestina ended her song on a very long, high-pitched note and loud applause issued out of the wireless, which Mrs. Weasley joined in with enthusiastically. \"Eez eet over?\" said Fleur loudly. \"Thank goodness, what an 'orrible --\" \"Shall we have a nightcap, then?\" asked Mr. Weasley loudly, leaping to his feet. \"Who wants eggnog?\" \"What have you been up to lately?\" Harry asked Lupin, as Mr, Weasley bustled off to fetch the eggnog, and everybody else stretched and broke into conversation. \"Oh, I've been underground,\" said Lupin. \"Almost literally. That's why I haven't been able to write, Harry; sending letters to you would have been something of a giveaway.\" -: \"What do you mean?\" ' \"I've been living among my fellows, my equals,\" said Lupin. \"Werewolves,\" he added, at Harrys look of incomprehension. \"Nearly all of them are on Voldemort's side. Dumbledore wanted a spy and here I was . . . ready-made.\" He sounded a little bitter, and perhaps realized it, for he smiled more warmly as he went on, \"I am not complaining; it is necessary work and who can do it better than I? However, it has been difficult gaining their trust. I bear the unmistakable signs of having tried to live among wizards, you see, whereas they have shunned normal society and live on the margins, stealing -- and sometimes killing -- to eat.\" \"How come they like Voldemort?\" \"They think that, under his rule, they will have a better life,\" said Lupin. \"And it is hard to argue with Greyback out there. . . .\" \"Who's Greyback?\" \"You haven't heard of him?\" Lupin's hands closed convulsively in his lap. \"Fenrir Greyback is, perhaps, the most savage werewolf alive today. He regards it as his mission in life to bite and to conta-minate as many people as possible; he wants to create enough were-wolves to overcome the wizards. Voldemort has promised him prey in return for his services. Greyback specializes in children. . . . Bite them young, he says, and raise them away from their parents, raise them to hate normal wizards. Voldemort has threatened to unleash him upon people's sons and daughters; it is a threat that usually produces good results.\" Lupin paused and then said, \"It was Greyback who bit me.\" \"What?\" said Harry, astonished. \"When -- when you were a kid, you mean?\" \"Yes. My father had offended him. I did not know, for a very long time, the identity of the werewolf who had attacked me; I even felt pity for him, thinking that he had had no control, know-ing by then how it felt to transform. But Greyback is not like that. At the full moon, he positions himself close to victims, ensuring that he is near enough to strike. He plans it all. And this is the man Voldemort is using to marshal the werewolves. I cannot pretend that my particular brand of reasoned argument is making much headway against Greyback's insistence that we werewolves deserve blood, that we ought to revenge ourselves on normal people.\" \"But you are normal!\" said Harry fiercely. \"You've just got a -- a problem --\" Lupin burst out laughing. \"Sometimes you remind me a lot of James. He called it my 'furry little problem in company. Many people were under the impression that I owned a badly behaved rabbit.\" He accepted a glass of eggnog from Mr. Weasley with a word of thanks, looking slightly more cheerful, Harry, meanwhile, felt a rush of excitement: This last mention of his father had reminded him that there was something he had been looking forward to ask-ing Lupin. \"Have you ever heard of someone called the Half-Blood Prince?\" \"The Half-Blood what?\" \"Prince,\" said Harry, watching him closely for signs of recogni-tion. \"There are no Wizarding princes,\" said Lupin, now smiling. \"Is this a title you re thinking of adopting? I should have thought be-ing 'the Chosen One' would be enough.\" \"It's nothing to do with me!\" said Harry indignantly. \"The Half-Blood Prince is someone who used to go to Hogwarts, I've got his old Potions book. He wrote spells all over it, spells he invented. One of them was Levicorpus --\" \"Oh, that one had a great vogue during my time at Hogwarts,\" said Lupin reminiscently. \"There were a few months in my fifth year when you couldn't move for being hoisted into the air by your ankle.\" \"My dad used it,\" said Harry. \"I saw him in the Pensieve, he used it on Snape.\" He tried to sound casual, as though this was a throwaway com-ment of no real importance, but he was not sure he had achieved the right effect; Lupins smile was a little too understanding. \"Yes,\" he said, \"but he wasn't the only one. As I say, it was very popular. . . . You know how these spells come and go. , . .\" \"But it sounds like it was invented while you were at school,\" Harry persisted. \"Not necessarily,\" said Lupin. \"Jinxes go in and out of fashion like everything else.\" He looked into Harry's face and then said quietly, \"James was a pureblood, Harry, and I promise you, he never asked us to call him 'Prince.'\" Abandoning pretense, Harry said, \"And it wasn't Sirius? Or you?\" \"Definitely not.\" \"Oh.\" Harry stared into the fire. \"I just thought -- well, he's helped me out a lot in Potions classes, the Prince has.\" \"How old is this book, Harry?\" \"I dunno, I've never checked.\" \"Well, perhaps that will give you some clue as to when the Prince was at Hogwarts,\" said Lupin. Shortly after this, Fleur decided to imitate Celestina singing \"A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love,\" which was taken by everyone, once they had glimpsed Mrs. Weasley's expression, to be the cue to go to bed. Harry and Ron climbed all the way up to Ron's attic bedroom, where a camp bed had been added for Harry. Ron fell asleep almost immediately, but Harry delved into his trunk and pulled out his copy of Advanced Potion-Making before getting into bed. There he turned its pages, searching, until he finally found, at the front of the book, the date that it had been pub-lished. It was nearly fifty years old. Neither his father, nor his father's friends, had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago. Feeling disappointed, Harry threw the book back into his trunk, turned off the lamp, and rolled over, thinking of werewolves and Snape, Stan Shunpike and the Half-Blood Prince, and finally falling into an uneasy sleep full of creeping shadows and the cries of bitten children. . . . \"She's got to be joking. . . .\" Harry woke with a start to find a bulging stocking lying over the end of his bed. He put on his glasses and looked around; the tiny window was almost completely obscured with snow and, in front of it, Ron was sitting bolt upright in bed and examining what ap-peared to be a thick gold chain. \"What's chat?\" asked Harry. ' \"Its from Lavender,\" said Ron, sounding revolted^ \"She earn honestly think I'd wear ...\" Harry looked more closely and let out a shout of laughter, Dan gling from the chain in large gold letters were the words: \"My sweetheart\" \"Nice,\" he said. \"Classy. You should definitely wear it in front ol Fred and George.\" \"If you tell them,\" said Ron, shoving the necklace out of sight under his pillow, \"I -- I -- I’ll --\" \"Stutter at me?\" said Harry, grinning. \"Come on, would I?\" \"How could she think I'd like something like that, though?\" Ron demanded of thin air, looking rather shocked. \"Well, think back,\" said Harry. \"Have you ever let it slip that you'd like to go out in public with the words 'My Sweetheart' round your neck?\" \"Well... we don't really talk much,\" said Ron. \"It's mainly . . .\" \"Snogging,\" said Harry. \"Well, yeah,\" said Ron. He hesitated a moment, then said, \"Is Hermione really going out with McLaggen?\" \"I dunno,\" said Harry. \"They were at Slughorn's party together, but I don't think it went that well.\" Ron looked slightly more cheerful as he delved deeper into his stocking. Harrys presents included a sweater with a large Golden Snitch worked onto the front, hand-knitted by Mrs. Weasley, a large box of Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes products from the twins, and a slightly damp, moldy-smelling package that came with a label read-ing To Master, From Kreacher, Harry stared at it. \"D'you reckon this is safe to open?\" he asked. \"Can't be anything dangerous, all our mail's still being searched at the Ministry,\" replied Ron, though he was eyeing the parcel suspiciously. \"I didn't think of giving Kreacher anything. Do people usually give their house-elves Christmas presents?\" asked Harry, prodding the parcel cautiously. \"Hermione would,\" said Ron. \"But let's wait and see what it is before you start feeling guilty.\" A moment later, Harry had given a loud yell and leapt out of his camp bed; the package contained a large number of maggots. \"Nice,\" said Ron, roaring with laughter. \"Very thoughtful.\" \"I'd rather have them than that necklace,\" said Harry, which sobered Ron up at once. Everybody was wearing new sweaters when they all sat down for Christmas lunch, everyone except Fleur (on whom, it appeared, Mrs. Weasley had not wanted to waste one) and Mrs. Weasley herself, who was sporting a brand-new midnight blue witch's hat glittering with what looked like tiny starlike diamonds, and a spec-tacular golden necklace. \"Fred and George gave them to me! Aren't they beautiful?\" .: \"Well, we find we appreciate you more and more, Mum, now we're washing our own socks,\" said George, waving an airy hand. \"Parsnips, Remus?\" \"Harry, you've got a maggot in your hair,\" said Ginny cheerfully, leaning across the table to pick it out; Harry felt goose bumps erupt up his neck that had nothing to do with the maggot. \"'Ow 'orrible,\" said Fleur, with an affected little shudder. \"Yes, isn't it?\" said Ron. \"Gravy, Fleur?\" . In his eagerness to help her, he knocked the gravy boat flying; Bill waved his wand and the gravy soared up in the air and returned meekly to the boat. \"You are as bad as zat Tonks,\" said Fleur to Ron, when she had finished kissing Bill in thanks. \"She is always knocking --\" \"I invited dear Tonks to come along today,\" said Mrs. Weasley, setting down the carrots with unnecessary force and glaring at Fleur. \"But she wouldn't come. Have you spoken to her lately, Remus?\" \"No, I haven't been in contact with anybody very much,\" said Lupin. \"But Tonks has got her own family to go to, hasn't she?\" \"Hmmm,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"Maybe. I got the impression she was planning to spend Christmas alone, actually.\" She gave Lupin an annoyed look, as though it was all his fault she was getting Fleur for a daughter-in-law instead of Tonks, but Harry, glancing across at Fleur, who was now feeding Bill bits of turkey off her own fork, thought that Mrs. Weasley was fighting a long-lost battle. He was, however, reminded of a question he had with regard to Tonks, and who better to ask than Lupin, the man who knew all about Patronuses? \"Tonks's Patronus has changed its form,\" he told him. \"Snape said so anyway. I didn't know that could happen. Why would your Patronus change?\" Lupin took his time chewing his turkey and swallowing before saying slowly, \"Sometimes ... a great shock ... an emotional up-heaval ...\" \"It looked big, and it had four legs,\" said Harry, struck by a sud-den thought and lowering his voice. \"Hey ... it couldn't be -- ?\" \"Arthur!\" said Mrs. Weasley suddenly. She had risen from her chair; her hand was pressed over her heart and she was staring out of the kitchen window. \"Arthur -- it's Percy!\" \"What?\" Mr. Weasley looked around. Everybody looked quickly at the window; Ginny stood up for a better look. There, sure enough, was Percy Weasley, striding across the snowy yard, his horn-rimmed glasses glinting in the sunlight. He was not, however, alone. \"Arthur, he's -- he's with the Minister!\" And sure enough, the man Harry had seen in the Daily Prophet was following along in Percy's wake, limping slightly, his mane of graying hair and his black cloak flecked with snow. Before any of , them could say anything, before Mr. and Mrs. Weasley could do : more than exchange stunned looks, the back door opened and there stood Percy. There was a moment's painful silence. Then Percy said rather stiffly, \"Merry Christmas, Mother.\" \"Oh, Percy!\" said Mrs. Weasley, and she threw herself into his arms. Rufus Scrimgeour paused in the doorway, leaning on his walk-ing stick and smiling as he observed this affecting scene. \"You must forgive this intrusion,\" he said, when Mrs. Weasley looked around at him, beaming and wiping her eyes. \"Percy and I were in the vicinity -- working, you know -- and he couldn't re-sist dropping in and seeing you all.\" But Percy showed no sign of wanting to greet any of the rest of the family. He stood, poker-straight and awkward-looking, and stared over everybody else's heads. Mr. Weasley, Fred, and George were all observing him, stony-faced. \"Please, come in, sit down, Minister!\" fluttered Mrs. Weasley, straightening her hat. Have a little purkey, or some tooding. ... 1 '. mean --\" \"No, no, my dear Molly,\" said Scrimgeour. Harry guessed that he had checked her name with Percy before they entered the house. \"I don't want to intrude, wouldn't be here at all if Percy hadn't wanted to see you all so badly. . . .\" \"Oh, Perce!\" said Mrs. Weasley tearfully, reaching up to kiss him. \". , . We've only looked in for five minutes, so I'll have a stroll around the yard while you catch up with Percy. No, no, I assure you I don't want to butt in! Well, if anybody cared to show me your charming garden . . . Ah, that young man's finished, why doesn't he take a stroll with me?\" The atmosphere around the table changed perceptibly. Every-body looked from Scrimgeour to Harry. Nobody seemed to find Scrimgeour's pretense that he did not know Harry's name convincing, or find it natural that he should be chosen to accompany the Minister around the garden when Ginny, Fleur, and George also had clean plates. \"Yeah, all right,\" said Harry into the silence. He was not fooled; for all Scrimgeour's talk that they had just been in the area, that Percy wanted to look up his family, this must be the real reason that they had come, so that Scrimgeour could speak to Harry alone. \"It's fine,\" he said quietly, as he passed Lupin, who had half risen from his chair. \"Fine,\" he added, as Mr. Weasley opened his mouth to speak. \"Wonderful!\" said Scrimgeour, standing back to let Harry pass through the door ahead of him. \"We'll just take a turn around the garden, and Percy and I'll be off. Carry on, everyone!\" Harry walked across the yard toward the Weasleys' overgrown, snow-covered garden, Scrimgeour limping slightly at his side. He had, Harry knew, been Head of the Auror office; he looked tough and battle-scarred, very different from portly Fudge in his bowler hat. \"Charming,\" said Scrimgeour, stopping at the garden fence and looking out over the snowy lawn and the indistinguishable plants. \"Charming.\" Harry said nothing. He could tell that Scrimgeour was watching him. \"I've wanted to meet you for a very long time,\" said Scrimgeour, after a few moments. \"Did you know that?\" \"No,\" said Harry truthfully. ¦!. \"Oh yes, for a very long time. But Dumbledore has been very protective of you,\" said Scrimgeour. \"Natural, of course, natural, after what you've been through. . . . Especially what happened at : the Ministry ...\": He waited for Harry to say something, but Harry did not oblige, : so he went on, \"I have been hoping for an occasion to talk to you ever since I gained office, but Dumbledore has -- most under-standably, as I say -- prevented this.\" Still, Harry said nothing, waiting. \"The rumors that have flown around!\" said Scrimgeour. \"Well, of course, we both know how these stories get distorted ... all these whispers of a prophecy . . . of you being 'the Chosen One'. . .\" They were getting near it now, Harry thought, the reason Scrim-geour was here. \"I assume that Dumbledore has discussed these matters with you?\", Harry deliberated, wondering whether he ought to lie or not. He looked at the little gnome prints all around the flowerbeds, ami the scuffed-up patch that marked the spot where Fred had caught the gnome now wearing the tutu at the top of the Christmas tree. Finally, he decided on the truth ... or a bit of it. \"Yeah, we've discussed it.\" \"Have you, have you . . .\" said Scrimgeour. Harry could see, out of the corner of his eye, Scrimgeour squinting at him, so he pre-tended to be very interested in a gnome that had just poked its head out from underneath a frozen rhododendron. \"And what has Dumbledore told you, Harry?\" \"Sorry, but that's between us,\" said Harry. He kept his voice as pleasant as he could, and Scrimgeour's tone, too, was light and friendly as he said, \"Oh, of course, if it's a question of confidences, I wouldn't want you to divulge . . . no, no ... and in any case, does it really matter whether you are 'the Chosen One' or not?\" Harry had to mull that one over for a few seconds before re-sponding. \"I don't really know what you mean, Minister.\" \"Well, of course, to you it will matter enormously,\" said Scrim-geour with a laugh. \"But to the Wizarding community at large . . . it's all perception, isn't it? It's what people believe that's important.\" Harry said nothing. He thought he saw, dimly, where they were heading, but he was not going to help Scrimgeour get there. The gnome under the rhododendron was now digging for worms at its roots, and Harry kept his eyes fixed upon it. \"People believe you are 'the Chosen One,' you see,\" said Scrim-geour. \"They think you quite the hero -- which, of course, you arc, Harry, chosen or not! How many times have you faced He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named now? Well, anyway,\" he pressed on, without waiting for a reply, \"the point is, you are a symbol of hope lor many, Harry. The idea that there is somebody out there who might be able, who might even be destined, to destroy He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named -- well, naturally, it gives people a lift. And I can't help but feel that, once you realize this, you might consider it, well, almost a duty, to stand alongside the Ministry, and give everyone a boost.\" The gnome had just managed to get hold of a worm. It was now tugging very hard on it, trying to get it out of the frozen ground. Harry was silent so long that Scrimgeour said, looking from Harry to the gnome, \"Funny little chaps, aren't they? But what say you, Harry?\" \"I don't exactly understand what you want,\" said Harry slowly. '\"Stand alongside the Ministry' . . . What does that mean?\" \"Oh, well, nothing at all onerous, I assure you,\" said Scrim-geour. \"If you were to be seen popping in and out of the Ministry from time to time, for instance, that would give the right impres-sion. And of course, while you were there, you would have ample : opportunity to speak to Gawain Robards, my successor as Head of the Auror office. Dolores Umbridge has told me that you cherish an ambition to become an Auror. Well, that could be arranged very easily. ...\" Harry felt anger bubbling in the pit of his stomach: So Dolores Umbridge was still at the Ministry, was she? \"So basically,\" he said, as though he just wanted to clarify a few points, \"you'd like to give the impression that I'm working for the Ministry?\" \"It would give everyone a lift to think you were more involved, Harry,\" said Scrimgeour, sounding relieved that Harry had cot-toned on so quickly. \"'The Chosen One,' you know. . . It's all about giving people hope, the feeling that exciting things are hap-pening. ...\" \"But if I keep running in and out of the Ministry,\" said Harry, still endeavoring to keep his voice friendly, \"won't that seem as though I approve of what the Ministry's up to?\" \"Well,\" said Scrimgeour, frowning slightly, \"well, yes, that's partly why we'd like --\" \"No, I don't think that'll work,\" said Harry pleasantly. \"You see, I don't like some of the things the Ministry's doing. Locking up Stan Shunpike, for instance.\" Scrimgeour did not speak for a moment but his expression hard-ened instantly. \"I would not expect you to understand,\" he said, and he was not as successful at keeping anger out of his voice as Harry had been. \"These are dangerous times, and certain measures need to be taken. You are sixteen years old --\" \"Dumbledore's a lot older than sixteen, and he doesn't think Stan should be in Azkaban either,\" said Harry. \"You're making Stan a scapegoat, just like you want to make me a mascot.\" They looked at each other, long and hard. Finally Scrimgeour said, with no pretense at warmth, \"I see. You prefer -- like your hero, Dumbledore -- to disassociate yourself from the Ministry?\" \"I don't want to be used,\" said Harry. \"Some would say it's your duty to be used by the Ministry!\" \"Yeah, and others might say its your duty to check that people really are Death Eaters before you chuck them in prison,\" said Harry, his temper rising now. \"You're doing what Barty Crouch did. You never get it right, you people, do you? Either we've got Fudge, pretending everything's lovely while people get murdered right under his nose, or we've got you, chucking the wrong people into jail and trying to pretend you've got 'the Chosen One' work-ing for you!\" ' i \"So you're not 'the Chosen One'?\" said Scrimgeour. ' \"I thought you said it didn't matter either way?\" said Harry, with a bitter laugh. \"Not to you anyway.\" \"I shouldn't have said that,\" said Scrimgeour quickly. \"It was tactless --\" \"No, it was honest,\" said Harry. \"One of the only honest things you've said to me. You don't care whether I live or die, but you do care that I help you convince everyone you're winning the war against Voldemort. I haven't forgotten, Minister....\" He raised his right fist. There, shining white on the back of his cold hand, were the scars which Dolores Umbridge had forced him to carve into his own flesh: I must not tell lies. \"I don't remember you rushing to my defense when I was trying to tell everyone Voldemort was back. The Ministry wasn't so keen to be pals last year.\" They stood in silence as icy as the ground beneath their feet. The gnome had finally managed to extricate his worm and was now sucking on it happily, leaning against the bottommost branches of the rhododendron bush. \"What is Dumbledore up to?\" said Scrimgeour brusquely. \"Where does he go when he is absent from Hogwarts?\" \"No idea,\" said Harry. \"And you wouldn't tell me if you knew,\" said Scrimgeour, \"would you?\" \"No, 1 wouldn't,\" said Harry. \"Well, then, I shall have to see whether I can't find out by other means.\" \"You can try,\" said Harry indifferently. \"But you seem cleverer than Fudge, so I'd have thought you'd have learned from his mis-takes. He tried interfering at Hogwarts. You might have noticed he's not Minister anymore, but Dumbledore’s still headmaster. I'd leave Dumbledore alone, if I were you.\" There was a long pause. \"Well, it is clear to me that he has done a very good job on you,\" said Scrimgeour, his eyes cold and hard behind his wire-rimmed glasses, \"Dumbledore’s man through and through, aren't you, Potter?\" \"Yeah, I am,\" said Harry. \"Glad we straightened that out.\" And turning his back on the Minister of Magic, he strode back toward the house. \n",

            " The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore The sun was coming up: The pure, colorless vastness of the sky stretched over him, indifferent to him and his suffering. Harry sat down in the tent entrance and took a deep breath of clean air. Simply to be alive to watch the sun rise over the sparkling snowy hillside ought to have been the greatest treasure on earth, yet he could not appreciate it: His senses had been spiked by the calamity of losing his want. He looked out over a valley blanketed in snow, distant church bells chiming through the glittering silence. Without realizing it, he was digging his fingers into his arms as if he were trying to resist physical pain. He had spilled his own blood more times than he could count; he had lost all bones in his right arm once; this journey had already given him scars to his chest and forearm to join those on his hand and forehead, but never, until this moment, had he felt himself to be fatally weakened, vulnerable, and naked, as though the best part of his magical power had been torn from him. He knew exactly what Hermione would say if he expressed any of this: The wand is only as good as the wizard. But she was wrong, his case was different. She had not felt the wand spin like the needle of a compass and shoot golden flames at his enemy. He had lost the protection of the twin cores, and only now that it was gone did he realize how much he had been counting on it. He pulled the pieces of the broken wand out of his pocket and, without looking at them, tucked them away in Hagrid’s pouch around his neck. The pouch was now too full of broken and useless objects to take any more. Harry’s hand brushed the old Snitch through the mokeskin and for a moment he had to fight the temptation to pull it out and throw it away. Impenetrable, unhelpful, useless, like everything else Dumbledore had left behind --- And his fury at Dumbledore broke over him now like lava, scorching him inside, wiping out every other feeling. Out of sheer desperation they had talked themselves into believing that Godric’s Hollow held answers, convinced themselves that they were supposed to go back, that it was all part of some secret path laid out for them by Dumbledore: but there was no map, no plan. Dumbledore had left them to grope in the darkness, to wrestle with unknown and undreamed-of terrors, alone and unaided: Nothing was explained, nothing was given freely, they had no sword, and now, Harry had no wand. And he had dropped the photograph of the thief, and it would surely be easy now for Voldemort to find out who he was . . . Voldemort had all the information now . . . \"Harry?\" Hermione looked frightened that he might curse her with her own wand. Her face streaked with tears, she crouched down beside him, two cups of tea trembling in her hands and something bulky under her arm. \"Thanks,\" he said, taking one of the cups. \"Do you mind if I talk to you?\" \"No,\" he said because he did not want to hurt her feelings. \"Harry, you wanted to know who that man in the picture was. Well . . . I’ve got the book.\" Timidly she pushed it onto his lap, a pristine copy of The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore. \"Where --- how --- ?\" \"It was in Bathilda’s sitting room, just lying there. . . . This note was sticking out of the top of it.\" Hermione read the few lines of spiky, acid-green writing aloud. \" ‘Dear Bally, Thanks for your help. Here’s a copy of the book, hope you like it. You said everything, even if you don’t remember it. Rita.’ I think it must have arrived while the real Bathilda was alive, but perhaps she wasn’t in any fit state to read it?\" \"No, she probably wasn’t.\" Harry looked down upon Dumbledore’s face and experienced a surge of savage pleasure: Now he would know if all the things that Dumbledore had never thought it worth telling him, whether Dumbledore wanted him to or not. \"You’re still really angry at me, aren’t you?\" said Hermione; he looked up to see fresh tears leaking out of her eyes, and knew that his anger must have shown in his face. \"No,\" he said quietly. \"No, Hermione, I know it was an accident. You were trying to get us out of there alive, and you were incredible. I’d be dead if you hadn’t been there to help me.\" He tried to return her watery smile, then turned his attention to the book. Its spine was stiff; it had clearly never been opened before. He riffled through the pages, looking for photographs. He came across the one he sought almost at once, the young Dumbledore and his handsome companion, roaring with laughter at some long-forgotten joke. Harry dropped his eyes to the caption. Albus Dumbledore, shortly after his mother’s death, With his friend Gellert Grindelwald. Harry gaped at the last word for several long moments. Grindelwald. His friend Grindelwald. He looked sideways at Hermione, who was still contemplating the name as though she could not believe her eyes. Slowly she looked up at Harry. \"Grindelwald!\" Ignoring the remainder of the photographs, Harry searched the pages around them for a recurrence of that fatal name. He soon discovered it and read greedily, but became lost: It was necessary to go farther back to make sense of it all, and eventually he found himself at the start of a chapter entitled \"The Greater Good.\" Together, he and Hermione started to read: Now approaching his eighteenth birthday, Dumbledore left Hogwarts in a blaze of glory --- Head Boy, Prefect, Winner of the Barnabus Finkley Prize for Exceptional Spell-Casting, British Youth Representative to the Wizengamot, Gold Medal-Winner for Ground-Breaking Contribution to the International Alchemical Conference in Cairo. Dumbledore intended, next, to take a Grand Tour with Elphias \"Dogbreath\" Doge, the dim-witted but devoted sidekick he had picked up at school. The two young men were staying at the Leaky Cauldron in London, preparing to depart for Greece the following morning, when an owl arrived bearing news of Dumbledore’s mother’s death. \"Dogbreath\" Doge, who refused to be interviewed for this book, has given the public his own sentimental version of what happened next. He represents Kendra’s death as a tragic blow, and Dumbledore’s decision to give up his expedition as an act of noble self-sacrifice. Certainly Dumbledore returned to Godric’s Hollow at once, supposedly to \"care\" for his younger brother and sister. But how much care did he actually give them? \"He were a head case, that Aberforth,\" said Enid Smeek, whose family lived on the outskirts of Godric’s Hollow at that time. \"Ran wild. ‘Course, with his mum and dad gone you’d have felt sorry for him, only he kept chucking goat dung at my head. I don’t think Albus was fussed about him. I never saw them together, anyway.\" So what was Albus doing, if not comforting his wild young brother? The answer, it seems, is ensuring the continued imprisonment of his sister. For though her first jailer had died, there was no change in the pitiful condition of Ariana Dumbledore. Her very existence continued to be known only to those few outsiders who, like \"Dogbreath\" Doge, could be counted upon to believe in the story of her \"ill health.\" Another such easily satisfied friend of the family was Bathilda Bagshot, the celebrated magical historian who has lived in Godric’s Hollow for many years. Kendra, of course, had rebuffed Bathilda when she first attempted to welcome the family to the village. Several years later, however, the author sent an owl to Albus at Hogwarts, having been favorably impressed by his paper on trans-species transformation in Transfiguration Today. This initial contract led to acquaintance with the entire Dumbledore family. At the time of Kendra’s death, Bathilda was the only person in Godric’s Hollow who was on speaking terms with Dumbledore’s mother. Unfortunately, the brilliance that Bathilda exhibited earlier in her life has now dimmed. \"The fire’s lit, but the cauldron’s empty,\" as Ivor Dillonsby put it to me, or, in Enid Smeek’s slightly earthier phrase, \"She’s nutty as squirrel poo.\" Nevertheless, a combination of tried-and-tested reporting techniques enabled me to extract enough nuggets of hard fact to string together the whole scandalous story. Like the rest of the Wizarding world, Bathilda puts Kendra’s premature death down to a backfiring charm, a story repeated by Albus and Aberforth in later years. Bathilda also parrots the family line on Ariana, calling her \"frail\" and \"delicate.\" On one subject, however, Bathilda is well worth the effort I put into procuring Veritaserum, for she, and she alone, knows the full story of the best-kept secret of Albus Dumbledore’s life. Now revealed for the first time, it calls into question everything that his admirers believed of Dumbledore: his supposed hatred of the Dark Arts, his opposition into the oppression of Muggles, even his devotion to his own family. The very same summer that Dumbledore went home to Godric’s Hollow, now an orphan and head of the family, Bathilda Bagshot agreed to accept into her home her great-nephew, Gellert Grindelwald. The name of Grindelwald is justly famous: In a list of Most Dangerous Dark Wizards of All Time, he would miss out on the top spot only because You- Know-Who arrived, a generation later, to steal his crown. As Grindelwald never extended his campaign of terror to Britain, however, the details of his rise to power are not widely known here. Educated at Durmstrang, a school famous even then for its unfortunate tolerance of the Dark Arts, Grindelwald showed himself quite as precociously brilliant as Dumbledore. Rather than channel his abilities into the attainment of awards and prizes, however, Gellert Grindelwald devoted himself no other pursuits. At sixteen years old, even Durmstrang felt it could no longer turn a blind eye to the twisted experiments of Gellert Grindelwald, and he was expelled. Hitherto, all that has been known of Grindelwald’s next movements is that he \"traveled around for some months.\" It can now be revealed that Grindelwald chose to visit his great-aunt in Godric’s Hollow, and that there, intensely shocking though it will be for many to hear it, he struck up a close friendship with none other than Albus Dumbledore. \"He seemed a charming boy to me,\" babbles Bathilda, \"whatever he became later. Naturally I introduced him to poor Albus, who was missing the company of lads his own age. The boys took to each other at once.\" They certainly did. Bathilda shows me a letter, kept by her that Albus Dumbledore sent Gellert Grindelwald in the dead of night. \"Yes, even after they’d spent all day in discussion --- both such brilliant young boys, they got on like a cauldron on fire --- I’d sometimes hear an owl tapping at Gellert’s bedroom window, delivering a letter from Albus! An idea would have struck him and he had to let Gellert know immediately!\" And what ideas they were. Profoundly shocking though Albus Dumbledore’s fans will find it, here are the thoughts of their seventeen-year-old hero, as relayed to his new best friend. (A copy of the original letter may be seen on page 463.) Gellert --- Your point about Wizard dominance being FOR THE MUGGLES’ OWN GOOD --- this, I think, is the crucial point. Yes, we have been given power and yes, that power gives us the right to rule, but it also gives us responsibilities over the ruled. We must stress this point, it will be the foundation stone upon which we build. Where we are opposed, as we surely will be, this must be the basis of all our counterarguments. We seize control FOR THE GREATER GOOD. And from this it follows that where we meet resistance, we must use only the force that is necessary and no more. (This was your mistake at Durmstrang! But I do not complain, because if you had not been expelled, we would never have met.) Albus Astonished and appalled though his many admirers will be, this letter constitutes the Statute of Secrecy and establishing Wizard rule over Muggles. What a blow for those who have always portrayed Dumbledore as the Muggle-borns’ greatest champion! How hollow those speeches promoting Muggle rights seem in the light of this damning new evidence! How despicable does Albus Dumbledore appear, busy plotting his rise to power when he should have been mourning his mother and caring for his sister! No doubt those determined to keep Dumbledore on his crumbling pedestal will bleat that he did not, after all, put his plans into action, that he must have suffered a change of heart, that he came to his senses. However, the truth seems altogether more shocking. Barely two months into their great new friendship, Dumbledore and Grindelwald parted, never to see each other again until they met for their legendary duel (for more, see chapter 22). What caused this abrupt rupture? Had Dumbledore come to his senses? Had he told Grindelwald he wanted no more part in his plans? Alas, no. \"It was poor little Ariana dying, I think, that did it,\" says Bathilda. \"It came as an awful shock. Gellert was there in the house when it happened, and he came back to my house all of a dither, told me he wanted to go home the next day. Terribly distressed, you know. So I arranged a Portkey and that was the last I saw of him. \"Albus was beside himself at Ariana’s death. It was so dreadful for those two brothers. They had lost everybody except for each other. No wonder tempers ran a little high. Aberforth blamed Albus, you know, as people will under these dreadful circumstances. But Aberforth always talked a little madly, poor boy. All the same, breaking Albus’s nose at the funeral was not decent. It would have destroyed Kendra to see her sons fighting like that, across her daughter’s body. A shame Gellert could not have stayed for the funeral. . . . He would have been a comfort to Albus, at least. . . . This dreadful coffin-side brawl, known only to those few who attended Ariana Dumbledore’s funeral, raises several questions. Why exactly did Aberforth Dumbledore blame Albus for his sister’s death? Was it, as \"Batty\" pretends, a mere effusion of grief? Or could there have been some more concrete reason for his fury? Grindelwald, expelled from Durmstrang for the near-fatal attacks upon fellow students, fled the country hours after the girl’s death, and Albus (out of shame or fear?) never saw him again, not until forced to do so by the pleas of the Wizarding world. Neither Dumbledore nor Grindelwald ever seems to have referred to this brief boyhood friendship in later life. However, there can be no doubt that Dumbledore delayed, for some five years of turmoil, fatalities, and disappearances, his attack upon Gellert Grindelwald. Was it lingering affection for the man or fear of exposure as his once best friend that caused Dumbledore to hesitate? Was it only reluctantly that Dumbledore set out to capture the man he was once so delighted he had met? And how did the mysterious Ariana die? Was she the inadvertent victim of some Dark rite? Did she stumble across something she ought not to have done, as the two young men sat practicing for their attempt at glory and domination? Is it possible that Ariana Dumbledore was the first person to die \"for the greater good\"? The chapter ended here and Harry looked up. Hermione had reached the bottom of the page before him. She tugged the book out of Harry’s hands, looking a little alarmed by his expression, and closed it without looking at it, as though hiding something indecent. \"Harry ---\" But he shook his head. Some inner certainty had crashed down inside him; it was exactly as he had felt after Ron left. He had trusted Dumbledore, believed him the embodiment of goodness and wisdom. All was ashes: How much more could he lose? Ron, Dumbledore, the phoenix wand . . . \"Harry.\" She seemed to have heard his thoughts. \"Listen to me. It --- it doesn't make a very nice reading ---\" \"Yeah, you could say that ---\" \"--- but don't forget, Harry, this is Rita Skeeter writing.\" \"You did read that letter to Grindelwald, didn't you?\" \"Yes, I --- I did.\" She hesitated, looking upset, cradling her tea in her cold hands. \"I think that's the worst bit. I know Bathilda thought it was all just talk, but 'For the Greater Good' became Grindelwald's slogan, his justification for all the atrocities he committed later. And . . . from that . . . it looks like Dumbledore gave him the idea. They say 'For the Greater Good' was even carved over the entrance to Nurmengard.\" \"What's Nurmengard?\" \"The prison Grindelwald had built to hold his opponents. He ended up in there himself, once Dumbledore had caught him. Anyway, it's --- it’s an awful thought that Dumbledore's ideas helped Grindelwald rise to power. But on the other hand, even Rita can't pretend that they knew each other for more than a few months one summer when they were both really young, and ---\" \"I thought you'd say that,\" said Harry. He did not want to let his anger spill out at her, but it was hard to keep his voice steady. \"I thought you'd say 'They were young.' They were the same age as we are now. And here we are, risking our lives to fight the Dark Arts, and there he was, in a huddle with his new best friend, plotting their rise to power over the Muggles.\" His temper would not remain in check much longer: He stood up and walked around, trying to work some of it off. \"I'm not trying to defend what Dumbledore wrote,\" said Hermione. \"All that 'right to rule' rubbish, it's 'Magic Is Might' all over again. But Harry, his mother had just died, he was stuck alone in the house ---\" \"Alone? He wasn't alone! He had his brother and sister for company, his Squib sister he was keeping locked up ---\" \"I don't believe it,\" said Hermione. She stood up too. \"Whatever was wrong with that girl, I don't think she was a Squib. The Dumbledore we knew would never, ever have allowed---\" \"The Dumbledore we thought we knew didn't want to conquer Muggles by force!\" Harry shouted, his voice echoing across the empty hilltop, and several blackbirds rose into the air, squawking and spiraling against the pearly sky. \"He changed, Harry, he changed! It's as simple as that! Maybe he did believe these things when he was seventeen, but the whole of the rest of his life was devoted to fighting the Dark Arts! Dumbledore was the one who stopped Grindelwald, the one who always voted for Muggle protection and Muggle born rights, who fought You-Know-Who from the start, and who died trying to bring him down!\" Rita's book lay on the ground between them, so that the face of Albus Dumbledore smiled dolefully at both. \"Harry, I'm sorry, but I think the real reason you're so angry is that Dumbledore never told you any of this himself.\" \"Maybe I am!\" Harry bellowed, and he flung his arms over his head, hardly knowing whether he was trying to hold in his anger or protect himself from the weight of his own disillusionment. \"Look what he asked from me, Hermione! Risk your life, Harry! And again! And again! And don't expect me to explain everything, just trust me blindly, trust that I know what I'm doing, trust me even though I don't trust you! Never the whole truth! Never!\" His voice cracked with the strain, and they stood looking at each other in the whiteness and emptiness, and Harry felt they were as insignificant as insects beneath that wide sky. \"He loved you,\" Hermione whispered. \"I know he loved you.\" Harry dropped his arms. \"I don't know who he loved, Hermione, but it was never me. This isn't love, the mess he's left me in. He shared a damn sight more of what he was really thinking with Gellert Grindelwald than he ever shared with me.\" Harry picked up Hermione's wand, which he had dropped in the snow, and sat back down in the entrance of the tent. \"Thanks for the tea. I'll finish the watch. You get back in the warm.\" She hesitated, but recognized the dismissal. She picked up the book and then walked back past him into the tent, but as she did so, she brushed the top of his head lightly with her hand. He closed his eyes at her touch, and hated himself for wishing that what she said was true: that Dumbledore had really cared. \n",

            ": The Slug Club Harry spent a lot of the last week of the holidays pondering the meaning of Malfoy's behavior in Knockturn Alley. What disturbed him most was the satisfied look on Malfoy's face as he had left the shop. Nothing that made Malfoy look that happy could be good news. To his slight annoyance, however, neither Ron nor Hermione seemed quite as curious about Malfoy's activities as he was; or at least, they seemed to get bored of discussing it after a few days. \"Yes, I've already agreed it was fishy, Harry,\" said Hermione a little impatiently. She was sitting on the windowsill in Fred and George's room with her feet up on one of the cardboard boxes and had only grudgingly looked up from her new copy of Advanced Rune Translation. \"But haven't we agreed there could be a lot of explanations?\" \"Maybe he's broken his Hand of Glory\" said Ron vaguely, as he attempted to straighten his broomstick's bent tail twigs. \"Remember that shriveled-up arm Malfoy had?\" \"But what about when he said, 'Don't forget to keep that one safe'?\" asked Harry for the umpteenth time. \"That sounded to me like Borgin's got another one of the broken objects, and Malfoy wants both.\" \"You reckon?\" said Ron, now trying to scrape some dirt off his broom handle. \"Yeah, I do,\" said Harry. When neither Ron nor Hermione answered, he said, \"Malfoy's father's in Azkaban. Don't you think Malfoy’d like revenge?\" Ron looked up, blinking. \"Malfoy, revenge? What can he do about it?\" \"That's my point, I don't know!\" said Harry, frustrated. \"But he's up to something and I think we should take it seriously. His father's a Death Eater and ...\" Harry broke off, his eyes fixed on the window behind Hermione, his mouth open. A startling thought had just occurred to him. \"Harry?\" said Hermione in an anxious voice. \"What's wrong?\" \"Your scar's not hurting again, is it?\" asked Ron nervously. \"He's a Death Eater,\" said Harry slowly. \"He's replaced his father as a Death Eater!\" There was a silence; then Ron erupted in laughter. \"Malfoy? He's sixteen, Harry! You think You-Know-Who would let Malfoy join?\" \"It seems very unlikely, Harry,\" said Hermione in a repressive sort of voice. \"What makes you think ... ?\" \"In Madam Malkin's. She didn't touch him, but he yelled and jerked his arm away from her when she went to roll up his sleeve. It was his left arm. He's been branded with the Dark Mark.\" Ron and Hermione looked at each other. \"Well...\" said Ron, sounding thoroughly unconvinced. \"I think he just wanted to get out of there, Harry,\" said Hermione. \"He showed Borgin something we couldn't see,\" Harry pressed on stubbornly. \"Something that seriously scared Borgin. It was the Mark, I know it... he was showing Borgin who he was dealing with, you saw how seriously Borgin took him!\" Ron and Hermione exchanged another look. \"I'm not sure, Harry...\" \"Yeah, I still don't reckon You-Know-Who would let Malfoy join...\" Annoyed, but absolutely convinced he was right, Harry snatched up a pile of filthy Quidditch robes and left the room; Mrs. Weasley had been urging them for days not to leave their washing and packing until the last moment. On the landing he bumped into Ginny, who was returning to her room carrying a pile of freshly laundered clothes. \"I wouldn't go in the kitchen just now,\" she warned him. \"There's a lot of Phlegm around.\" \"I'll be careful not to slip in it.\" Harry smiled. Sure enough, when he entered the kitchen it was to find Fleur sitting at the kitchen table, in full flow about plans for her wedding to Bill, while Mrs. Weasley kept watch over a pile of self-peeling sprouts, looking bad-tempered. \"... Bill and I 'ave almost decided on only two bridesmaids, Ginny and Gabrielle will look very sweet togezzer. I am theenking of dressing zem in pale gold, pink would of course be 'orrible with Ginny's 'air!\" \"Ah, Harry!\" said Mrs. Weasley loudly, cutting across Fleur's monologue. \"Good, I wanted to explain about the security arrangements for the journey to Hogwarts tomorrow. We've got Ministry cars again, and there will be Aurors waiting at the station.\" \"Is Tonks going to be there?\" asked Harry, handing over his Quidditch things. \"No, I don't think so, she's been stationed somewhere else from what Arthur said.\" \"She has let 'erself go, zat Tonks,\" Fleur mused, examining her own stunning reflection in the back of a teaspoon. \"A big mistake if you ask.\" \"Yes, thank you,\" said Mrs. Weasley tartly, cutting across Fleur again. \"You'd better get on, Harry, I want the trunks ready tonight, if possible, so we don't have the usual last-minute scramble.\" And in fact, their departure the following morning was smoother than usual. The Ministry cars glided up to the front of the Burrow to find them waiting, trunks packed; Hermione's cat, Crookshanks, safely enclosed in his traveling basket; and Hedwig; Ron's owl, Pig-widgeon; and Ginny's new purple Pygmy Puff, Arnold, in cages. \"Au revoir, 'Any,\" said Fleur throatily, kissing him good-bye. Ron hurried forward, looking hopeful, but Ginny stuck out her foot and Ron fell, sprawling in the dust at Fleur's feet. Furious, red-faced, and dirt-spattered, he hurried into the car without saying good-bye. There was no cheerful Hagrid waiting for them at King's Cross Station. Instead, two grim-faced, bearded Aurors in dark Muggle suits moved forward the moment the cars stopped and, flanking the party, marched them into the station without speaking. \"Quick, quick, through the barrier,\" said Mrs. Weasley, who seemed a little flustered by this austere efficiency. \"Harry had better go first, with...\" She looked inquiringly at one of the Aurors, who nodded briefly, seized Harry's upper arm, and attempted to steer him toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten. \"I can walk, thanks,\" said Harry irritably, jerking his arm out of the Auror's grip. He pushed his trolley directly at the solid barrier, ignoring his silent companion, and found himself, a second later, standing on platform nine and three-quarters, where the scarlet Hogwarts Express stood belching steam over the crowd. Hermione and the Weasleys joined him within seconds. Without waiting to consult his grim-faced Auror, Harry motioned to Ron and Hermione to follow him up the platform, looking for an empty compartment. \"We can't, Harry,\" said Hermione, looking apologetic. \"Ron and I've got to go to the prefects' carriage first and then patrol the corridors for a bit.\" \"Oh yeah, I forgot,\" said Harry. \"You'd better get straight on the train, all of you, you've only got a few minutes to go,\" said Mrs. Weasley, consulting her watch. \"Well, have a lovely term, Ron...\" \"Mr. Weasley, can I have a quick word?\" said Harry, making up his mind on the spur of the moment. \"Of course,\" said Mr. Weasley, who looked slightly surprised, but followed Harry out of earshot of the others nevertheless. Harry had thought it through carefully and come to the conclusion that, if he was to tell anyone, Mr. Weasley was the right person; firstly, because he worked at the Ministry and was therefore in the best position to make further investigations, and secondly, because he thought that there was not too much risk of Mr. Weasley exploding with anger. He could see Mrs. Weasley and the grim-faced Auror casting the pair of them suspicious looks as they moved away. \"When we were in Diagon Alley,\" Harry began, but Mr. Weasley forestalled him with a grimace. \"Am I about to discover where you, Ron, and Hermione disappeared to while you were supposed to be in the back room of Fred and George's shop?\" \"How did you...?\" \"Harry, please. You're talking to the man who raised Fred and George.\" \"Er... yeah, all right, we weren't in the back room.\" \"Very well, then, let's hear the worst.\" \"Well, we followed Draco Malfoy. We used my Invisibility Cloak.\" \"Did you have any particular reason for doing so, or was it a mere whim?\" \"Because I thought Malfoy was up to something,\" said Harry, disregarding Mr. Weasley's look of mingled exasperation and amusement. \"He'd given his mother the slip and I wanted to know why.\" \"Of course you did,\" said Mr. Weasley, sounding resigned. \"Well? Did you find out why?\" \"He went into Borgin and Burkes,\" said Harry, \"and started bullying the bloke in there, Borgin, to help him fix something. And he said he wanted Borgin to keep something else for him. He made it sound like it was the same kind of thing that needed fixing. Like they were a pair. And...\" Harry took a deep breath. \"There's something else. We saw Malfoy jump about a mile when Madam Malkin tried to touch his left arm. I think he's been branded with the Dark Mark. 1 think he's replaced his father as a Death Eater.\" Mr. Weasley looked taken aback. After a moment he said, \"Harry, I doubt whether You-Know-Who would allow a sixteen-year-old...\" \"Does anyone really know what You-Know-Who would or wouldn't do?\" asked Harry angrily. \"Mr. Weasley, I'm sorry, but isn't it worth investigating? If Malfoy wants something fixing, and he needs to threaten Borgin to get it done, it's probably something Dark or dangerous, isn't it?\" \"I doubt it, to be honest, Harry,\" said Mr. Weasley slowly. \"You see, when Lucius Malfoy was arrested, we raided his house. We took away everything that might have been dangerous.\" \"I think you missed something,\" said Harry stubbornly. \"Well, maybe,\" said Mr. Weasley, but Harry could tell that Mr. Weasley was humoring him. There was a whistle behind them; nearly everyone had boarded the train and the doors were closing. \"You'd better hurry!' said Mr. Weasley, as Mrs. Weasley cried, \"Harry, quickly!\" He hurried forward and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley helped him load his trunk onto the train. \"Now, dear, you're coming to us for Christmas, it's all fixed with Dumbledore, so we'll see you quite soon,\" said Mrs. Weasley through the window, as Harry slammed the door shut behind him and the train began to move. \"You make sure you look after yourself and...\" The train was gathering speed. \"...be good and...\" , She was jogging to keep up now. \"...stay safe!\" Harry waved until the train had turned a corner and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were lost to view, then turned to see where the others had got to. He supposed Ron and Hermione were cloistered in the prefects' carriage, but Ginny was a little way along the corridor, chatting to some friends. He made his way toward her, dragging his trunk. People stared shamelessly as he approached. They even pressed their faces against the windows of their compartments to get a look at him. He had expected an upswing in the amount of gaping and gawping he would have to endure this term after all the \"Chosen One\" rumors in the Daily Prophet, but he did not enjoy the sensation of standing in a very bright spotlight. He tapped Ginny on the shoulder. \"Fancy trying to find a compartment?\" \"I can't, Harry, I said I'd meet Dean,\" said Ginny brightly. \"See you later.\" \"Right,\" said Harry. He felt a strange twinge of annoyance as she walked away, her long red hair dancing behind her; he had become so used to her presence over the summer that he had almost forgotten that Ginny did not hang around with him, Ron, and Hermione while at school. Then he blinked and looked around: He was surrounded by mesmerized girls. \"Hi, Harry!\" said a familiar voice from behind him. \"Neville!\" said Harry in relief, turning to see a round-faced boy struggling toward him. \"Hello, Harry,\" said a girl with long hair and large misty eyes, who was just behind Neville. \"Luna, hi, how are you?\" \"Very well, thank you,\" said Luna. She was clutching a magazine to her chest; large letters on the front announced that there was a pair of free Spectrespecs inside. \"Quibbler still going strong, then?\" asked Harry, who felt a certain fondness for the magazine, having given it an exclusive interview the previous year. \"Oh yes, circulation's well up,\" said Luna happily. \"Let's find seats,\" said Harry, and the three of them set off along the train through hordes of silently staring students. At last they found an empty compartment, and Harry hurried inside gratefully. \"They're even staring at us? said Neville, indicating himself and Luna. \"Because we're with you!\" \"They're staring at you because you were at the Ministry too,\" said Harry, as he hoisted his trunk into the luggage rack. \"Our little adventure there was all over the Daily Prophet, you must've seen it.\" \"Yes, I thought Gran would be angry about all the publicity,\" said Neville, \"but she was really pleased. Says I'm starting to live up to my dad at long last. She bought me a new wand, look!\" He pulled it out and showed it to Harry. \"Cherry and unicorn hair,\" he said proudly. \"We think it was one of the last Ollivander ever sold, he vanished next day ... oi, come back here, Trevor!\" And he dived under the seat to retrieve his toad as it made one of its frequent bids for freedom. \"Are we still doing D.A. meetings this year, Harry?\" asked Luna, who was detaching a pair of psychedelic spectacles from the middle of The Quibbler. \"No point now we've got rid of Umbridge, is there?\" said Harry, sitting down. Neville bumped his head against the seat as he emerged from under it. He looked most disappointed. \"I liked the D.A.! I learned loads with you!\" \"I enjoyed the meetings too,\" said Luna serenely. \"It was like having friends.\" This was one of those uncomfortable things Luna often said and which made Harry feel a squirming mixture of pity and embarrassment. Before he could respond, however, there was a disturbance outside their compartment door; a group of fourth-year girls was whispering and giggling together on the other side of the glass. \"You ask him!\" No, you! \"I'll do it!\" And one of them, a bold-looking girl with large dark eyes, a prominent chin, and long black hair pushed her way through the door. \"Hi, Harry, I'm Romilda, Romilda Vane,\" she said loudly and confidently. \"Why don't you join us in our compartment? You don't have to sit with them,\" she added in a stage whisper, indicating Neville's bottom, which was sticking out from under the seat again as he groped around for Trevor, and Luna, who was now wearing her free Spectrespecs, which gave her the look of a demented, multicolored owl. \"They're friends of mine,\" said Harry coldly. \"Oh,\" said the girl, looking very surprised. \"Oh. Okay.\" And she withdrew, sliding the door closed behind her. \"People expect you 10 have cooler friends than us,\" said Luna, once again displaying her knack for embarrassing honesty. \"You are cool,\" said Harry shortly. \"None of them was at the Ministry. They didn't fight with me.\" \"That's a very nice thing to say,\" beamed Luna. Then she pushed her Spectrespecs farther up her nose and settled down to read The Quibbler. \"We didn't face him, though,\" said Neville, emerging from under the seat with fluff and dust in his hair and a resigned-looking Trevor in his hand. \"You did. You should hear my gran talk about you. 'That Harry Potter's got more backbone than the whole Ministry of Magic put together!' She'd give anything to have you as a grand-son... Harry laughed uncomfortably and changed the subject to OWL. results as soon as he could. While Neville recited his grades and wondered aloud whether he would be allowed to take a Transfiguration NEWT, with only an \"Acceptable,\" Harry watched him without really listening. Neville's childhood had been blighted by Voldemort just as much as Harry's had, but Neville had no idea how close he had come to having Harry's destiny. The prophecy could have referred to either of them, yet, for his own inscrutable reasons, Voldemort had chosen to believe that Harry was the one meant. Had Voldemort chosen Neville, it would be Neville sitting opposite Harry bearing the lightning-shaped scar and the weight of the prophecy... Or would it? Would Neville’s mother have died to save him, as Lily had died for Harry? Surely she would... But what if she had been unable to stand between her son and Voldemort? Would there then have been no \"Chosen One\" at all? An empty seat where Neville now sat and a scarless Harry who would have been kissed good-bye by his own mother, not Ron's? \"You all right, Harry? You look funny,\" said Neville. Harry started. \"Sorry ... I ...\" \"Wrackspurt got you?\" asked Luna sympathetically, peering at Harry through her enormous colored spectacles. \"I... what?\" \"A Wrackspurt... They're invisible. They float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy,\" she said. \"I thought I felt one zooming around in here.\" She flapped her hands at thin air, as though beating off large invisible moths. Harry and Neville caught each other's eyes and hastily began to talk of Quidditch. The weather beyond the train windows was as patchy as it had been all summer; they passed through stretches of the chilling mist, then out into weak, clear sunlight. It was during one of the clear spells, when the sun was visible almost directly overhead, that Ron and Hermione entered the compartment at last. \"Wish the lunch trolley would hurry up, I'm starving,\" said Ron longingly, slumping into the seat beside Harry and rubbing his stomach. \"Hi, Neville. Hi, Luna. Guess what?\" he added, turning to Harry. \"Malfoy s not doing prefect duty. He's just sitting in his compartment with the other Slytherins, we saw him when we passed.\" Harry sat up straight, interested. It was not like Malfoy to pass up the chance to demonstrate his power as prefect, which he had happily abused all the previous year. \"What did he do when he saw you?\" \"The usual,\" said Ron indifferently, demonstrating a rude hand gesture. \"Not like him, though, is it? Well... that is\" -- he did the hand gesture again -- \"but why isn't he out there bullying first years? \"Dunno,\" said Harry, but his mind was racing. Didn't this look as though Malfoy had more important things on his mind than bullying younger students? \"Maybe he preferred the Inquisitorial Squad,\" said Hermione. \"Maybe being a prefect seems a bit tame after that.\" \"I don't think so,\" said Harry. \"I think he's ...\" But before he could expound on his theory, the compartment door slid open again and a breathless third-year girl stepped inside. \"I'm supposed to deliver these to Neville Longbottom and Harry P-Potter,\" she faltered, as her eyes met Harry's and she turned scarlet. She was holding out two scrolls of parchment tied with violet ribbon. Perplexed, Harry and Neville took the scroll addressed to each of them and the girl stumbled back out of the compartment. \"What is it?\" Ron demanded, as Harry unrolled his. \"An invitation,\" said Harry. Harry, I would be delighted if you would join me for a bite of lunch in compartment C. Sincerely, Horace \"But what does he want me for?\" asked Neville nervously, as though he was expecting detention. \"No idea,\" said Harry, which was not entirely true, though he had no proof yet that his hunch was correct. \"Listen,\" he added, seized by a sudden brain wave, \"let's go under the Invisibility Cloak, then we might get a good look at Malfoy on the way, see what he's up to.\" This idea, however, came to nothing: The corridors, which were packed with people on the lookout for the lunch trolley, were impossible to negotiate while wearing the cloak. Harry stowed it regretfully back in his bag, reflecting that it would have been nice to wear it just to avoid all the staring, which seemed to have increased in intensity even since he had last walked down the train. Every now and then, students would hurtle out of their compartments to get a better look at him. The exception was Cho Chang, who darted into her compartment when she saw Harry coming. As Harry passed the window, he saw her deep in determined conversation with her friend Marietta, who was wearing a very thick layer of makeup that did not entirely obscure the odd formation of pimples still etched across her face. Smirking slightly, Harry pushed on. When they reached compartment C, they saw at once that they were not Slughorn's only invitees, although judging by the enthusiasm of Slughorn's welcome, Harry was the most warmly anticipated. \"Harry, m'boy!\" said Slughorn, jumping up at the sight of him so that his great velvet-covered belly seemed to fill all the remaining space in the compartment. His shiny bald head and great silvery mustache gleamed as brightly in the sunlight as the golden buttons on his waistcoat. \"Good to see you, good to see you! And you must be Mr. Longbottom!\" Neville nodded, looking scared. At a gesture from Slughorn, they sat down opposite each other in the only two empty seats, which were nearest the door. Harry glanced around at their fellow guests. He recognized a Slytherin from their year, a tall black boy with high cheekbones and long, slanting eyes; there were also two seventh-year boys Harry did not know and, squashed in the corner beside Slughorn and looking as though she was not entirely sure how she had got there, Ginny. \"Now, do you know everyone?\" Slughorn asked Harry and Neville. \"Blaise Zabini is in your year, of course --\" Zabini did not make any sign of recognition or greeting, nor did Harry or Neville: Gryffindor and Slytherin students loathed each other on principle. \"This is Cormac McLaggen, perhaps you've come across each other ... ? No?\" McLaggen, a large, wiry-haired youth, raised a hand, and Harry and Neville nodded back at him. \"... and this is Marcus Belby, I don't know whether ...?\" Belby, who was thin and nervous-looking, gave a strained smile. \"... and this charming young lady tells me she knows you!\" Slughorn finished. Ginny grimaced at Harry and Neville from behind Slughorn's back. \"Well now, this is most pleasant,\" said Slughorn cozily. \"A chance to get to know you all a little better. Here, take a napkin. I've packed my own lunch; the trolley, as I remember it, is heavy on licorice wands, and a poor old man's digestive system isn't quite up to such things... Pheasant, Belby?\" Belby started and accepted what looked like half a cold pheasant. \"I was just telling young Marcus here that I had the pleasure of teaching his Uncle Damocles,\" Slughorn told Harry and Neville, now passing around a basket of rolls. \"Outstanding wizard, outstanding, and his Order of Merlin most well-deserved. Do you see much of your uncle, Marcus?\" Unfortunately, Beiby had just taken a large mouthful of pheasant; in his haste to answer Slughorn he swallowed too fast, turned purple, and began to choke. \"Anapneo,\" said Slughorn calmly, pointing his wand at Belby, whose airway seemed to clear at once. \"Not... not much of him, no,\" gasped Belby, his eyes streaming. \"Well, of course, I daresay he's busy,\" said Slughorn, looking questioningly at Belby. \"I doubt he invented the Wolfsbane Potion without considerable hard work!\" \"I suppose...\" said Belby, who seemed afraid to take another bite of pheasant until he was sure that Slughorn had finished with him. \"Er... he and my dad don't get on very well, you see, so I don't really know much about...\" His voice tailed away as Slughorn gave him a cold smile and turned to McLaggen instead. \"Now, you, Cormac,\" said Slughorn, \"I happen to know you see a lot of your Uncle Tiberius, because he has a rather splendid picture of the two of you hunting nogtails in, I think, Norfolk?\" \"Oh, yeah, that was fun, that was,\" said McLaggen. \"We went with Bertie Higgs and Rufus Scrimgeour; this was before he became Minister, obviously ...\" \"Ah, you know Bertie and Rufus too?\" beamed Slughorn, now offering around a small tray of pies; somehow, Belby was missed out. \"Now tell me...\" It was as Harry had suspected. Everyone here seemed to have been invited because they were connected to somebody well-known or influential... everyone except Ginny. Zabini, who was interrogated after McLaggen, turned out to have a famously beautiful witch for a mother (from what Harry could make out, she had been married seven times, each of her husbands dying mysteriously and leaving her mounds of gold). It was Neville's turn next: This was a very uncomfortable ten minutes, for Neville's parents, well-known Aurors, had been tortured into insanity by Bellatrix Lestrange and a couple of Death Eater cronies. At the end of Neville's interview, Harry had the impression that Slughorn was reserving judgment on Neville, yet to see whether he had any of his parents' flair. \"And now,\" said Slughorn, shifting massively in his seat with the air of a compere introducing his star act. \"Harry Potter! Where to begin? I feel I barely scratched the surface when we met over the summer!\" He contemplated Harry for a moment as though he was a particularly large and succulent piece of pheasant, then said, \"'The Chosen One,' they're calling you now!\" Harry said nothing. Belby, McLaggen, and Zabini were all staring at him. \"Of course,\" said Slughorn, watching Harry closely, \"there have been rumors for years... I remember when ... well ... after that terrible night ... Lily ... James ... and you survived ... and the word was that you must have powers beyond the ordinary ...\" Zabini gave a tiny little cough that was clearly supposed to indicate amused skepticism. An angry voice burst out from behind Slughorn. \"Yeah, Zabini, because you're so talented... at posing...\" \"Oh dear!\" chuckled Slughorn comfortably, looking around at Ginny, who was glaring at Zabini around Slughorn's great belly. \"You want to be careful, Blaise! I saw this young lady perform the most marvelous Bat-Bogey Hex as I was passing her carriage! I wouldn't cross her!\" Zabini merely looked contemptuous. \"Anyway,\" said Slughorn, turning back to Harry. \"Such rumors this summer. Of course, one doesn't know what to believe, the Prophet has been known to print inaccuracies, make mistakes ... but there seems little doubt, given the number of witnesses, that there was quite a disturbance at the Ministry and that you were there in the thick of it all!\" Harry, who could not see any way out of this without flatly lying, nodded but still said nothing. Slughorn beamed at him. \"So modest, so modest, no wonder Dumbledore is so fond ... you were there, then? But the rest of the stories ... so sensational, of course, one doesn't know quite what to believe ... this fabled prophecy, for instance ...\" \"We never heard a prophecy,\" said Neville, turning geranium pink as he said it. \"That's right,\" said Ginny staunchly. \"Neville and I were both there too, and all this 'Chosen One' rubbish is just the Prophet making things up as usual.\" \"You were both there too, were you?\" said Slughorn with great interest, looking from Ginny to Neville, but both of them sat clam-like before his encouraging smile. \"Yes... well... it is true that the Prophet often exaggerates, of course...\" Slughorn said, sounding a little disappointed. \"I remember dear Gwenog telling me (Gwenog Jones, I mean, of course, Captain of the Holyhead Harpies) ...\" He meandered off into a long-winded reminiscence, but Harry had the distinct impression that Slughorn had not finished with him, and that he had not been convinced by Neville and Ginny. The afternoon wore on with more anecdotes about illustrious wizards Slughorn had taught, all of whom had been delighted to join what he called the \"Slug Club\" at Hogwarts. Harry could not wait to leave, but couldn't see how to do so politely. Finally the train emerged from yet another long misty stretch into a red sunset, and Slughorn looked around, blinking in the twilight. \"Good gracious, it's getting dark already! I didn't notice that they'd lit the lamps! You'd better go and change into your robes, all of you. McLaggen, you must drop by and borrow that book on nogtails. Harry, Blaise ... any time you're passing. Same goes for you, miss,\" he twinkled at Ginny. \"Well, off you go, off you go!\" As he pushed past Harry into the darkening corridor, Zabini shot him a filthy look that Harry returned with interest. He, Ginny, and Neville followed Zabini back along the train. \"I'm glad that's over,\" muttered Neville. \"Strange man, isn't he?\" \"Yeah, he is a bit,\" said Harry, his eyes on Zabini. \"How come you ended up in there, Ginny?\" \"He saw me hex Zacharias Smith,\" said Ginny. \"You remember that idiot from Hufflepuff who was in the D.A.? He kept on and on asking about what happened at the Ministry and in the end he annoyed me so much I hexed him ... when Slughorn came in I thought I was going to got detention, but he just thought it was ;i really good hex and invited me to lunch! Mad, eh?\" \"Better reason for inviting someone than because their mother's famous,\" said Harry, scowling at the back of Zabini's head, \"or because their uncle...\" But he broke off. An idea had just occurred to him, a reckless but potentially wonderful idea... In a minute's time, Zabini was going to reenter the Slytherin sixth-year compartment and Malfoy would be sitting there, thinking himself unheard by anybody except fellow Slytherins... If Harry could only enter, unseen, behind him, what might he not see or hear? True, there was little of the journey left ... Hogsmeade Station had to be less than half an hour away, judging by the wildness of the scenery flashing by the windows ... but nobody else seemed prepared to take Harry's suspicions seriously, so it was down to him to prove them. \"I'll see you two later,\" said Harry under his breath, pulling out his Invisibility Cloak and flinging it over himself. \"But what're you ... ?\" asked Neville. \"Later!\" whispered Harry, darting after Zabini as quietly as possible, though the rattling of the train made such caution almost pointless. The corridors were almost completely empty now. Nearly everyone had returned to their carriages to change into their school robes and pack up their possessions. Though he was as close as he could get to Zabini without touching him, Harry was not quick enough to slip into the compartment when Zabini opened the door. Zabini was already sliding it shut when Harry hastily stuck out his foot to prevent it closing. \"What's wrong with this thing?\" said Zabini angrily as he smashed the sliding door repeatedly into Harry's foot. Harry seized the door and pushed it open, hard; Zabini, still clinging on to the handle, toppled over sideways into Gregory Goyle's lap, and in the ensuing ruckus, Harry darted into the compartment, leapt onto Zabini's temporarily empty seat, and hoisted himself up into the luggage rack. It was fortunate that Goyle and Zabini were snarling at each other, drawing all eyes onto them, for Harry was quite sure his feet and ankles had been revealed as the cloak had flapped around them; indeed, for one horrible moment he thought he saw Malfoy's eyes follow his trainer as it whipped upward out of sight. But then Goyle slammed the door shut and flung Zabini off him; Zabini collapsed into his own seat looking ruffled, Vincent Crabbe returned to his comic, and Malfoy, sniggering, lay back down across two seats with his head in Pansy Parkinsons lap. Harry lay curled uncomfortably under the cloak to ensure that every inch of him remained hidden, and watched Pansy stroke the sleek blond hair off Malfoy's forehead, smirking as she did so, as though anyone would have loved to have been in her place. The lanterns swinging from the carriage ceiling cast a bright light over the scene: Harry could read every word of Crabbe's comic directly below him. \"So, Zabini,\" said Malfoy, \"what did Slughorn want?\" \"Just trying to make up to well-connected people,\" said Zabini, who was still glowering at Goyle. \"Not that he managed to find many.\" This information did not seem to please Malfoy. \"Who else had he invited?\" he demanded. \"McLaggen from Gryffindor,\" said Zabini. \"Oh yeah, his uncle's big in the Ministry,\" said Malfoy. \"... someone else called Belby, from Ravenclaw ...\" \"Not him, he's a prat!\" said Pansy. \"... and Longbottom, Potter, and that Weasley girl,\" finished Zabini. Malfoy sat up very suddenly, knocking Pansy's hand aside. \"He invited Longbottom?.\" \"Well, I assume so, as Longbottom was there,\" said Zabini indifferently. \"What's Longbottom got to interest Slughorn?\" Zabini shrugged. \"Potter, precious Potter, obviously he wanted a look at 'the Chosen One,'\" sneered Malfoy, \"but that Weasley girl! What's so special about her?\" \"A lot of boys like her,\" said Pansy, watching Malfoy out of the corner of her eyes for his reaction. \"Even you think she's good-looking, don't you, Blaise, and we all know how hard you are to please! \"I wouldn't touch a filthy little blood traitor like her whatever she looked like,\" said Zabini coldly, and Pansy looked pleased. Malfoy sank back across her lap and allowed her to resume the stroking of his hair. \"Well, I pity Slughorn's taste. Maybe he's going a bit senile. Shame, my father always said he was a good wizard in his day. My father used to be a bit of a favorite of his. Slughorn probably hasn't heard I'm on the train, or...\" \"I wouldn't bank on an invitation,\" said Zabini. \"He asked me about Notts father when I first arrived. They used to be old friends, apparently, but when he heard he'd been caught at the Ministry he didn't look happy, and Nott didn't get an invitation, did he? 1 don't think Slughorn's interested in Death Eaters.\" Malfoy looked angry, but forced out a singularly humorless laugh. \"Well, who cares what he's interested in? What is he, when you come down to it? Just some stupid teacher.\" Malfoy yawned ostentatiously. \"I mean, I might not even be at Hogwarts next year, what's it matter to me if some fat old has-been likes me or not?\" \"What do you mean, you might not be at Hogwarts next year?\" said Pansy indignantly, ceasing grooming Malfoy at once. \"Well, you never know,\" said Malfoy with the ghost of a smirk. \"I might have ... er ... moved on to bigger and better things.\" Crouched in the luggage rack under his cloak, Harry's heart began to race. What would Ron and Hermione say about this? Crabbe and Goyle were gawping at Malfoy; apparently they had had no inkling of any plans to move on to bigger and better things. Even Zabini had allowed a look of curiosity to mar his haughty features. Pansy resumed the slow stroking of Malfoy s hair, looking dumbfounded. \"Do you mean...\" Malfoy shrugged. \"Mother wants me to complete my education, but personally, I don't see it as that important these days. I mean, think about it... When the Dark Lord takes over, is he going to care how many OWLs or N.E.W.T.S anyone's got? Of course he isn't. It'll be all about the kind of service he received, the level of devotion he was shown.\" \"And you think you'll be able to do something for him?\" asked Zabini scathingly. \"Sixteen years old and noi even fully qualified yet?\" \"I've just said, haven't I? Maybe he doesn't care if I'm qualified. Maybe the job he wants me to do isn't something that you need to be qualified for,\" said Malfoy quietly. Crabbe and Goyle were both sitting with their mouths open like gargoyles. Pansy was gazing down at Malfoy as though she had never seen anything so awe-inspiring. \"I can see Hogwarts,\" said Malfoy, clearly relishing the effect he had created as he pointed out of the blackened window. \"We'd better get our robes on.\" Harry was so busy staring at Malfoy, he did not notice Goyle reaching up for his trunk; as he swung it down, it hit Harry hard on the side of the head. He let out an involuntary gasp of pain, and Malfoy looked up at the luggage rack, frowning. Harry was not afraid of Malfoy, but he still did not much like the idea of being discovered hiding under his Invisibility Cloak by a group of unfriendly Slytherins. Eyes still watering and head still throbbing, he drew his wand, careful not to disarrange the cloak, and waited, breath held. To his relief, Malfoy seemed to decide that he had imagined the noise; he pulled on his robes like the others, locked his trunk, and as the train slowed to a jerky crawl, fastened a thick new traveling cloak round his neck. Harry could see the corridors filling up again and hoped that Hermione and Ron would take his things out onto the platform for him; he was stuck where he was until the compartment had quite emptied. At last, with a final lurch, the train came to a complete halt. Goyle threw the door open and muscled his way out into a crowd of second years, punching them aside; Crabbe and Zabini followed. \"You go on,\" Malfoy told Pansy, who was waiting for him with her hand held out as though hoping he would hold it. \"I just want to check something.\" Pansy left. Now Harry and Malfoy were alone in the compartment. People were filing past, descending onto the dark platform. Malfoy moved over to the compartment door and let down the blinds, so that people in the corridor beyond could not peer in. He then bent down over his trunk and opened it again. Harry peered down over the edge of the luggage rack, his heart pumping a little faster. What had Malfoy wanted to hide from Pansy? Was he about to see the mysterious broken object it was so important to mend? \"Petrificus Totalus!\" Without warning, Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry, who was instantly paralyzed. As though in slow motion, he toppled out of the luggage rack and fell, with an agonizing, floor-shaking crash, at Malfoy's feet, the Invisibility Cloak trapped beneath him, his whole body revealed with his legs still curled absurdly into the cramped kneeling position. He couldn't move a muscle; he could only gaze up at Malfoy, who smiled broadly. \"I thought so,\" he said jubilantly. \"I heard Goyle's trunk hit you. And I thought I saw something white flash through the air after Zabini came back...\" His eyes lingered for a moment upon Harry's trainers. \"You didn't hear anything I care about, Potter. But while I've got you here...\" And he stamped, hard, on Harry's face. Harry felt his nose break; blood spurted everywhere. \"That's from my father. Now, let's see...\" Malfoy dragged the cloak out from under Harry's immobilized body and threw it over him. \"I don't reckon they'll find you till the trains back in London,\" he said quietly. \"See you around, Potter... or not.\" And taking care to tread on Harry's fingers, Malfoy left the compartment. \n",
